the noodle here is not very good it was not cooked thorougly i warn you do not get the smoothies i think  slush tasted much better than this crap
should have listened to the numerous negative reviews online lrb and there were many rrb but we trusted guy from diners drivins  dives big mistake clue  strip mall with huge cheesy banner boasting food network endorsement clue  self serves signin waiting list apparently the slimy owner was too busy gushing over customers trying to eat but steering clear of unhappy ones misters and drinking water would have been a nice touch to make the min degree wait more bearable the minute we saw the paper table cloths and plastic chairs cups  utensils we were in trouble one waiter frantically tried to service the whole restaurant which was a complete zoo now according to triple d the pasta was homemade aaaaaah not so much ive been to italy i know the difference cut to the chase for two a la carte  appetizer sized entrees seems to me his only goal is cashing in on the tv appearance as quickly as possible with no concern to repeat business do nt waste your time and money on a positive note guy was right about matts big breakfast in downtown phoenix great good and the best costumer service we ve ever had
horrible service me and my friends went there after work for the happy hour we asked jessica how things were but she could nt give a straight answer about if the fish was fresh then we put our drink order in and she decided to send about to minutes talking to the hostess the sushi chef was nice and found the female manger working and she brought our drinks to use and said that she would talk to jessica food came the it was soo soo my friend order the fried tofu it was soggy jessica did manage to make here happy and take off the her bill my bill was a different story it was happy hour and i guess that jessica flunked out of basic math she over charge my meal not once not twice but three times they gave me happy hour prices for drinks but not for my food if i had not would of been over charged over my company sends people here for training i am going to tell all my co workers to pass the place up or just do nt tip the horrible waitress jessica with the bad red hair
i went to this establishment for my birthday walked in for one beer minutes we left at to find our designated drivers vehicle had been towed a dirt parking lot chalk lines an empty space in between two cars is where we parked no signs visible had to call the tow company would not let us pick the car up til in the morning had to take a taxi i was then informed all city towing owned the lot that coach house leases for parking later a miserable experience will never go back the coach house said tough claims we were illegally parked blocking an exit really our vehicle was actually stolen in my eyes what a racket
watch out for this place they told me i needed work done that i did nt and they tried to take advantage of me knowing that i do nt know anything about cars the guy was smiling as he told me i needed worth of repairs luckily my son s father is a mechanic and he took a look at my car instead lrb they were nt so nice when they realized they were nt going to get my business rrb the repairs i needed done were less than it s places like this that give shops bad reputations

i have been a verizon customer for many years and this is the worst service i have ever received i expect the prices to be higher in a verizon corporate store than costco best buy etc lrb which they are rrb however i also expect the quality of the service and the knowledge of the products to be higher as well lrb which it is not rrb

being a huge fan of vietnamese food and how healthy it is i tried this place with a friends recommendation he had pointed this place out since it had the very same menu as my favorite place da vang knowing this i thought this place was maybe a family relative or something and might have a very similar food which should be very good boy was i wrong so wrong that i would almost have thought that my friend was playing a horrible joke on me had he not been sitting next to me i would have thought that he was not serious about this place almost so bad to the point that i had to question our friendship for a brief short period we were sitting there to start the spring roll one of the most popular vietnamese creations that everyone knows when done right it can cause overloading emotions of happiness and satisfaction we all know that a good spring roll is a sign of a good beginning to a meal almost like that first real good kiss you get well this one is not it small skinny and filled with nothing but lost hope and broken dream small portions of shrimp and meat if there was any meat in it at all most of all the they even cheaped out on the vermicelli noodles lettuce and mint more like the worst kiss you ever got bad enough to break up over then the pho the staple of vietnamese cuisine the first thing that anyone thinks about when they hear vietnamese food well upon ordering the food i expected a delicious and heart warming soup well the broth was flavorless i could have made a better one with water and a bouillon cube the dish was beautiful though so simple and the onions and jalapeno cut thin as they can get it and the cilantro chopped roughly the taste was just not there the service like any vietnamese place was lacking this place was the worst of them all the server a kid who spoke no english paying no attention to anyone and not caring at all he must have gotten suckered into free labor by his father or someone who equally did nt care about their patrons all in all the visual appeal of the pho was amazing in that the small details of the ingredients were executed nicely the spring roll was done poorly and you can get a better one from trader joe s the flavors of the food lacking in all aspects please someone give them some salt and pepper to cook with pho in it s greatness can be enjoyed with out all the sriracha or hoison we all love to ruin the natural flavor of the broth with but this place it is needed to bring the brown water of a broth to life
yea i too am discovering doubt caffe sanora lrb organic rrb was tasty coffee but the link on their label wwwwellementscom leads to nothing a page under construction no further info on the company etc i purchased this bag of preground coffee at either central market or whole foods in austin last month in their prepackaged coffee aisle because the package intrigued me with an natural antioxidant coffee statement including the aiding research  a portion of our proceeds supports notforprofit cancer prevention research very nice packaging the copy also states they work with small family farms who handpick these beans and that the roasting process leaves more antioxidants in their product than green tea now that i look more closely the tiny certified by biolatina sticker is covering something that has been crossed out in red sharpie my my i will not be purchasing any more of this product whomever contrived the package copy should win an award for copywriting however they touched on every point i needed to make a concerted effort to support the health of the planet and sustainable agriculture disturbing about your po box being falsely used eric w hope you get things solved
i woke up this morning with big balls looking for a great meal to eat i walked into the hard rock cafe with a rock hard boner and the seating lady was pretty cute unfortunately not cute enough for the hour long seating wait once i sat on my big balls i ordered some lemonade which was delicious but what came next was a real shocker i got a big cheeseburger lrb it was really called that rrb and a short while later i got a big burnt cheeseball i calmly asked the waitress to take it back to the kitchen seeing it was extremley burnt and fifteen minutes later i got an equally burnt burger it was as if they waited and put it in the microwave and then gave it back to me i might as well have lit a cow on fire and then eaten it anyways three hours later i realized i was coming down with terrible diarrea surprise  sigh  although i love hard rock and rock hard stuff this was not awesome balls
was just completely ignored for fifteen minutes at the men s sunglasses case not impressed i ll go someplace else with my impulse shopping
its alright but i would rather visit other establishments at tempe marketplace i do nt even know where to start with the service usually the service sucks and no one pays attention to you or the server is in a hurry to get out the last time i paid a visit to this place was after the movies i wanted to get some drinks with friends and maybe some foods the server was attentive to the point where she was trying to rush us out she finally told us that she was done for the night and wanted us to cash out we wanted to continue drinking but this girl ended our night at cadillac and we took our business else where i have worked in the restaurant business before and i know you can transfer tables to another server without driving the customer away i have never had a good experience when i come here when i do stop for a visit my expectations are very low
confession i am an obnoxious asian food snob i really try to take that into consideration when i rate places i have nt lived in china or anything but i really really love eating chinese food i also hope to convey to you that i am still american at heart i hate panda express but i truly truly worship an excellently prepared orange chicken be that as it may there are instances in which i have to suspend my courtesy toward lessthanperfect food because the product that i received was not only poor quality but insulting relative to the price i paid this is the experienced i received ordering from chopstick express i ordered chopstick express family special for me my roommates and an incredibly hungry foodie friend of mine whom happened to be over upon reaching an orderer it was refreshing though annoying to be talking to what seemed to be an obnoxious teenager being forced to take orders whatever water off a duck s back quack quack we ordered orange chicken cashew chicken and brocoli beef which came with fried rice and egg rolls it was supposed to come with crab puffs but they were not delivered which i felt was almost an insult all the food we received was lukewarm at best cold at worst it s chinese food it can hold at nuclear temperatures and i do nt think it snobbish of me to assume that delivery people can afford to invest in a proper traveling method i must admit my major problem with this is the fact that it took nearly an hour for the delivery person to get here which means assuming that the food left fresh it spend a halfhour uninsulated i do nt believe i ll get sick from this food but considering that being served very hot food is clearly the industry standard it still seems sketch at best and disgusting at worst i digress at any rate the food was as follows orange chicken the pieces of orange chicken were about the size of mediumsized chicken tenders they were then covered in a weak breading fried unevenly and covered in a tolerable orange sauce which was the only saving grace of the dish it came deeply compacted in a chinese takeout paper box which was problematic for this dish because the chicken essentially came out in giant clumps brocoli beef easily the best dish but only by reason of advantage the brocoli was tender though strangely bitter the beef they chose to use was akin to stew beef which is the really thick fatty cut used in crock pots for stews because they have the capacity to cook for ever and ever amen this resulted in incredibly large chewy chunks i gotta admit panda owns brocoli beef and chopstick express could take a few pointers the sauce was decent enough yet ultimately forgettable cashew chicken offensive bland strange the sauce seemed to be more like cream of chicken than the savory peppery sauce to which i am accustomed i ate maybe two cashews in my share which is boring interesting to note was the presence of noodles in the dish despite the fact that we were also given rice and peas peas  white rice nearly impossible to mess up and only when exceptional is worthy of meditation average rice though served essentially at room temperature which dried the rice out fried rice shocking in case you read my review chopstick express please take note your fried rice sealed my distrust of your food safety practices fried rice is cooked fast and hot but because of the quickness of the cooking never dries out this looked burnt literally burnt or seasoned with something both bland and dark as all holy hell fried rice should not appear to be dried out burnt and dark as chocolate egg rolls i do nt trust these they were almost cold to the touch crab puffs not present in my order those are my favorite d summary steer clear away from this place at all costs the advantage of living so close to mekong plaza means not being terribly far away from decent chinese and vietnamese food and i feel like i have disappointed my tongue by attempting to branch out if these strange in congruencies are nt addressed by the management of chopstick express i worry that like what happened with me they will lose crucial local business and be forced to close i do nt know maybe it was an offday but in my opinion if something takes an hour to get to my place when the drive is minutes tops it better sparkle and wow chopstick express in its disparaging food disturbing distance from food safety and respectability and excessive delivery time means that i will never eat from them again
i should have known this place was trouble when it ended up opening more than two weeks late i was honestly stunned to discover it open one afternoon i d gone out otherwise so i figured why not  well the store itself is laid out very poorly there s nowhere for the register line to go besides in front of the yogurt dispensers it might have only been moderately busy during my visit but the most basic navigation of the premises made for a horrible sprinkle accident waiting to happen while i was waiting to check out i noticed something on the sides of the uniform visors you can imagine my cheektwitching disgust when i realized this something was a locator number for a bible verse how very tacky by then i had no chance to flee so i forked over a truly ridiculous amount for two pints of yogurt lrb more than ten dollars rrb and drove home it s really not very good yogurt very artificial and apparently prone to cause heartburn or so one of my housemates  who seldom suffers from such  informs me i got off with tasting a cross between cookie dough and styrene for an hour after i ate what bible quote did the visors reference you may ask  i wanted to know too if it was something along the lines of love everyone yay that i almost could have accepted that no such luck ephesians in him we were also chosen having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will which just made me wonder who the hell would celebrate being chosen to open a frozen yogurt franchise  so there you have it bad dessert brought to you by creepy selfdefeatist fundies avoid edited to add the last time i walked past this place they were blaring christian rock at their outdoor patio not only annoying but tasteless to the point of offensive i hope the starbucks next door complains i really do
sakana s had always been my favorite casual sushi bar in town it was very inexpensive and the quality was very good however the wait staff is among the worst in town and never fails to detract from my dinning pleasure i go there times a month instead of the times a week i d go before they took a turn for the worse when i do go the hostess and wait staff always appear angry is it to much to ask for a smile or at least not the pissed off look they serve on a regular bases if they would only take a page out of the way oregano s hires and trains their wait staff sakana s could be iconic their unagi use to be legendary now forgettable rrb owners please fire everyone except the sushi chefs and hire nice happy people who enjoying working with the public and bring back your legendary unagi even if your have to charge more
i was very disappointed in the customer service that i received from jiffy lube i went in with a coupon for a oil change and walked out pay for services that were not discussed beforehand when dealing with mechanic s i ve always been skeptical and this place did not change my mind i am in need of an honest mechanic that is nt required by their employeer to upcharge the customer i will never return to this place again
very bright cafeteria feel average food over priced we go every few years to see if things have changed they never do reminds me of a high end nursing home cafeteria
i have had an absolutely terrible experience with every aspect of asu everytime i try and call to get help the people in the offices are not only annoyed that they have to help you they are rude and do nt know what they are talking about and those that do know what you should do are too lazy to try and help you fix the mistake i was given the wrong phone number for an advisor lrb complete accident rrb then the woman helping me told me that i had a completely different number and person but said but you know what it s no big deal i wait weeks to be fit into the schedule only to call for my appointment and find out that yes actually it is a very big deal and i was set back another month all because the girl was too lazy to look up another number this is just one very simple example of the type of people i have found at this institution there have been many instances that have happened that have brought me to write this review but i do nt want to be here all day i just wanted to advice anyone out there looking for a school to do whatever you can to not attend arizona state university rude people terrible service no help i could go on and on unfortunately this website will not allow me to give this anything less than star it is very undeserving even of that one star in conclusion the award for most worthless incompetent pos institution on earth congratulations arizona state university
i do nt know why i keep trying i went through the drive through today for some pork carnitas only to get home and find their mystery meat version of beef aarrghh had to throw it away it was so scary even more frustrating because the girl on the mike made me repeat it twice and i heard her say pork twice oh well
i can not agree with lauren v more just thinking about my experience at this place makes my blood boil
it will probably only be a matter of time before the scottsdale location closes following in the footsteps of the san francisco and los angeles locations the truth is the food is probably well received by the scottsdale and phoenix crowd however in san francisco where quality expectations are much higher the restaurant floundered and closed shortly after a costly renovation of the former stars building during our visit i was so utterly disappointed in the meals and presentation that i felt that i had to apologize to my dining companions for making such a poor dining recommendation foolish me outdoor dining in a sunny environment does not make the meal taste any better though it does enhance the experience which might explain my single star while a trip to the valley ho is worth a visit to check out the mid century modern decor i would sum up trader vic s scottsdale as one big poo poo lrb pu pu rrb platter
this might be the worst kfc in the world
driver had a really bad attitude the apartment number was wrong and she asked sooo did you just enter it wrong or what  then she kept me on the phone without talking while she trudged over to my apartment i apologized for the mix up and she said nothing the most interaction she had with me at the door was to ask if this was my credit card  i still tipped her because i ve been a server before but thinking back maybe i should not have i would never have been so rude to a customer the pizza tasted pretty good but i already had a bad taste in my mouth next time i will order from papa john s or one of the other pizza places near asu
over one year later this review is behind but wanted to get it out there as i can still remember how terrible this place treated us hopefully they ve fired the manager and upped their customer service we have been coming here for a couple years until last spring training we had a party of people we loved going here because of the vibrant atmosphere and the sushi so what transpired was this we had a reservation obviously it was busy so even with a reservation we were seated an hour and half over our reservation time it was fine as we ordered drinks by the bar and waited we then got our table it took another half an hour to order and another minutes to get our food  so time frame was now almost hours since we got to this restaurant half the people got their food and took another  minutes later for the rest of us to get our food it was a lot of waiting we ordered more sushi and it took another half an hour really  rolling sushi would take that long  so we wanted to talk to the manager they sent someone over and told him what happened this is what he said if you did nt like the service go ahead leave we have a ton of business and we d rather turn the table for other patrons so i said really this is how you address the situation without appologizing even and telling us to leave we asked again to talk to the manager he said i am the manager what  everyone was so upset by this point and threw their money for their food on the table and left this was the worst service i ve ever gotten anywhere  ever so to ra sushi  you ve lost customers for life
really dissapointing i went in for carry out lrb was just hoping to get a bahn mi sandwich rrb i waited almost minutes and felt that the lady that took my order could have cared less that i was there  she was cold the sandwich was tiny lrb compared to other bahn mi i have had rrb and it did not taste real fresh on this one i suggest you pass
cons no tea at a korean restaurant no water refill even though they should know it s like degrees outside in phoenix and really do they not realize how spicy the majority of their food is  waitresses did nt know what the hell they were doing did nt let me replace beef for pork and yes i m just being petty as this point but their pen had no ink when we signed the receipt but we were just too fed up with everything else pros very clean place lrb because it s fairly new rrb especially the bathroom i know there are nt many korean restaurants in phoenix but do nt eat here they really have no clue how to run a restaurant
gross i was originally really excited when sunflower market came to town it seemed pretty cool and was a bit closer than trader joe s lrb which i love rrb however i have since had yucky experiences there and one annoying one it all began when i went to the deli the guy working behind the counter clearly had a cold sniffling and wiping his nose etc as he was getting my stuff i could nt help but notice the four flys buzzing around and landing here and there  eeeww after a few months i decided to give it another try i was going camping and needed some grub i got some of the trail mix from the bulk section and brought it with me on my trip i lrb and others rrb munched on it throughout the weekend when there was maybe a third of the bag left i looked in and noticed those gross little worm things that get into dry goods that are way way too old disgusting as for my annoying encounter it was not as much of a deal breaker  just an incompetent and slow cashier too bad the concept is good t joe i love you
have been there twice in the past few months first time was during the busier snow bird season my wife and i were seated quickly order was taken and then they forgot about us tables next to us got their food quickly but ours never came spoke to the manager who offered to quickly make our entrees but we left since we had somewhere to go tried it again about weeks ago it was not busy but the service was again terrible we wanted to order drinks but could not get the attention of our server who was standing at the ending of the room talking to the other servers we finally had to ask one of the busboys our food came relatively quickly my wife ordered a hamburger it was so greasy that the bun was saturated with grease and not edible we complained to the manager who offered to bring her another we decided to leave after finishing the appetizers would not go back it is unfortunate since we live min away and would love to have a good neighborhood place
just when you think airport food is improvingalong comes taberna del tequileria blue corn quesidilla with pork so dry i had to drown it in salsa lrb in the stupid little cups  like another reviewer pointed out rrb in order to choke it down  house maragarita come onit was a flavorless glass of ice slush glad to get back to my  home airport lrb pdx rrb where they have real restauranteurs running their own places that take pride in what they serve
i liked this club till they charged me for a bottle that i did not order the owner is always too intoxicated to know what is going on
took my son here for his th birthday yesterday along with other family members they refused to sing happy birthday to my son lrb it was an arranged birthday party rrb  of the people that had the fajitas are now extremely ill this place is awful and should be shut down our waiter was always missing and every meal we had was cold
i have not been a huge fan of charlies for a while for some reason it always smells like vomit about months ago my car was broken into they stole a purse out of the front floor board the funny thing is they had police walking the parking lot fast forward to now march th had another car broken into this time they stole a caboodle which had make up in it and a rhinestoned mask when we went inside and asked them to call the police they said they could nt and gave us the number to do it ourselves great customer service i think not then we were out side and the bar manager came out and said they have video of the whole parking lot and we can get a copy of it great oh but but we have to wait till thursday now i hate the bar even more
i wo nt even venture to guess why so many people like this place but a few notes no it is nothing like a european cafe  no it is not an actual wine bar  yes the service absolutely sucks we came here for a friend s birthday party her mother had arranged ahead of time for of us to be there and to have wine brought to the tables and poured and some appetizers brought out while we were waiting for the guest of honor but before that let s start with parking you ca nt park in the residential streets because you need a permit fine i heard they had a valet and there s nothing on their website about parking so whatever i head to the valet who asks me if i am dining at postino s or la grande orange i say postino s and he says ok that s i asked if they seriously were charging me for valet parking based on which restaurant i was going to and they would nt answer i asked if there was an atm since i had no cash and they told me there is one but it does nt work i got back in my car and drove around looking for a place to park for about minutes fantastic when i get there about girls from the party are standing at the front waiting for someone to notice them finally a very unfriendly gentleman pointed to two tables and said those are yours those other tables where people are eating are also yours but they re not done yet we told them when they were seated they needed to be done in an hour but they re still there ok so now we only have two of our four tables great finally they seat us at our two tables another unfriendly staff member comes over and plunks down a few wine glasses and asks if we want a glass of temperanillo she pours one of the girls a random taste and then walks away upon her return i asked if this was the wine we were supposed to have because it was a malbec she argued with me about that for a few minutes until i pointed to the label she said oh and walked away i never did find out if we were supposed to have the malbec at this point the other two tables had been cleared no one brought any other glasses or put the tables together so we did it also no one opened the other bottles and yes they were screwtop but still so i opened them finally everyone else arrived we still only had wine glasses after trying in vain for several minutes we finally managed to flag down the unfriendly woman and asked for more wine glasses to which she responded rudely we do nt have any more and walked away i had to ask three different rude uninterested staff members for wine glasses and managed to finally get another few but still not everyone ended up with a glass seriously  anyway the bruschetta came out while the menu offers a lof of different ones they are all so deplorably bland and underseasoned that they felt unfinished the fig marscapone and prosciutto should have been good but the poor pig that gave its life was disgraced dry flavorless most of the bread pieces were nt even cut all the way through so we were all manhandling the pieces to get them apart the bread was obviously just grocery store bread and i doubt anything is truly handmade the issue is the quality of their ingredients sucks they obviously buy the cheapest grocery store crap they can and then mark it up everything even the apples on one of the bruschettas were lacking in any real flavor when they should have been tart and crisp instead of dull and mealy and as for a wine bar  seriously a joke they have a half of a sheet of paper one side as their wine list no flights no tastings but for the audience it attracts who are easily impressed by overpriced glop and wine in a trendy area they ll continue to do just fine i will never be back
do nt go here on a busy day which is whenever the dbacks or suns play you will be waiting forever for your food and it will be cold then when you complain they blame it on being busy and make you feel like an idiot the owner sits drinking instead of helping out and basically tells customers to shut up and stop whining  reply to owners comment  jason maybe you should get your facts straight before posting a reply we waited for over minutes for our cold food to arrive only after we asked the bartender where our food was your manager walked over with our ticket and said i see you ve been waiting for over minutes for your food when we responded that we had never waited that long she replied well we re busy and shorthanded there was no upfront apology to the fact that our food was late making us in turn late for the game your bartender is not a pleasant person as she would ask what we wanted and not wait for the answer before turning and getting another customer a drink unfortunately we were seated behind one of the beer taps to begin the afternoon and seemed to be forgotten as we sat with empty glasses we did not demand to speak to the owner he had said hello about min earlier and when the manager came over my mom asked to speak to the owner she said he s not working today and my mom replied i just saw him your manager then said i ll go get the owner for you there was no demanding there also please learn to read before posting replies as i stated the owner basically said to shut up and stop whining the way he spoke to us is the reason why we would never come back also you posted in my mom s review that our food and drinks were comped we sent the food back as it was cold so it was nt comped and we only had beers between the two of us the last two were just poured and left undranken get your facts straight before coming on here and calling people liars maybe if your bartender would have been a little more personable and offered an apology or something in the first place this whole situation would have been remedied
what does this hotel have going for it  location you can walk to nearly anyplace you d want to go in scottsdale however when you read the other reviews complaining of the noise believe them how bad can it be  the walls are thinner than any dorm room so much that you can hear everything going on around you it s excessive to say the least you hear people coming and going the noise from bar in the hotel conversations in the room next door it s literally like they re all in the room with you i felt guilty playing music while in the shower because i knew i was disturbing my neighbors i stayed for three nights lrb at a night rrb over a long weekend and did nt get one good nights sleep the hotel should focus a little less on fancy wall paper and more on sound proofing for that price i expected better next time i ll walk a few extra blocks and stay at the hilton for the same cost
this is my uncle s favorite chinese place in phoenix and i have no idea why it s a little junk chinese food spot but it begs the question is nt junk chinese at least supposed to taste good  i mean i know what i m putting into my body is nt actually good for me but gourmet house of hong kong makes the act of eating it not even pleasurable so what exactly is the point  the spot is nt very clean lrb the bathroom  complete ew rrb the noodles are gummy the tofu is rubbery the sweet and sour sauce was kind of good but i think it added to my stomach ache lrb which began mid meal rrb the crunchy things they ll give you if you ask  those are good crunchy things and a semidoable sweet and sour do not a restaurant going experience make
if i could give less stars i would pros very nice quality large screen and neat seats that move to the movie cons well lets see we went to see the hunger games we had a groupon for tickets and a large popcorn sounds awesome i know well we upgraded to the dbox seats that move to the movie for an extra dollars a ticket the seats were neat and all but definitely not worth it and not very comfy i wanted to use a coupon i had gotten for signing up for their email list and was told to go to the box office to have them print it out the what i assumed was the manager told me he could nt accept because the fine print which was invisible said it had to be printed whatever concessions are waaaaaaay overpriced i mean way more than the already obligatory astronomical movie markup in my opinion you should nt charge that much for a small amount of nonrefillable stale popcorn lrb really really stale btw rrb customer service here sucked no one was older than which is nt a bad thing except that inexperienced management leads to horrible service i heard a few times ok whatever and well there s nothing i can do that and the fact that the place was pretty empty but for some reason every time you needed someone no one was there two concession stands and no one there  really  oh and forgot to mention movie was to start at they would nt let anyone in until because they were cleaning sure did nt look clean to me with all the popcorn on our seats ps  i used to be a movie theater employee and i m ashamed of what they are doing to the movie going experience needless to say i will never be coming back wish i could get a refund and just donate it to a good theater just for being there
used to be a decent place but had a really bad experience recently  food poisoning we ordered a spinach pizza without cheese and four of us shared it all four were doubled over the next day with cramps and the rest of it called the store and they promised to follow up and call back but never did shows that they are not only careless but also seemingly willing to play fast and loose with customer loyalty hope the city of scottsdale gives their operations a careful look will not be going there again ever
i am amazed the foregoing reviews can not possibly be speaking of the restaurant we visited during restaurant week we had pm reservations and arrived on time to find probably guests standing around waiting for their tables we joined them my husband became bored and walked around the small place counting tables waiting to be cleared minutes later no one had offered us a drink no cocktail serving person was to be seen but at last we were seated more minutes passed slowly by no acknowledgement of our presence no welcoming smiles hellos eye contact ah at last water was poured into our glasses yes there is some liquid refreshment available in this arid place water still no acknowledgement the water bearer was silent and did not look up from his task hello here s the waiter asking us for our order er may we see the menu first  do you serve drinks in this restaurant  may we order something to drink  yes we had to ask let s speak briefly about the food salad a salty undressed mess brie and figs no figs tomato leek tartlet very good filet steaks tasteless lobster and pasta it was nt lobster it was langoustine no flavor salmon ok as for the desserts great pecan pie ruined by pouring caramel sauce over it we all know that pecan pie is sweet enough do nt we  after all this the final straw was the very annoying waiter who hummed incessantly as he served in all fairness he was totally unaware of his habit as was everyone else who worked there otherwise surely he would have been told to stop no we will not be returning so many great restaurants in the camelback corridor why would we 
the first time i went to coal burger it was due to very poor planning on a saturday night it was the only place without a long waiting list and we had a movie to catch the menu and prices were unspectacular none of the salads looked too interesting but i figured at least i was having a relatively healthy meal i liked the diet cherry cola the friend i went with actually really liked her salad the first time and asked if we could go back this time i decided to try the organic nonantibiotic free range etc etc etc chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries the chicken sandwich was in a word disgusting it had those black grill lines that cause cancer and was also covered in flecks of some terrible seasoning powder i scraped off some of the black stuff gingerly took a bite and was totally grossed out by the texture apparently you ca nt assume that a grilled chicken sandwich is going to be a grilled chicken breast sandwich lrb yes i just put the word breast in allcaps rrb the grilled chicken sandwich is a chicken patty made from ground up chicken like a giant chicken mcnugget minus the breading it was pretty horrific i swiftly traded the chicken sandwich for a veggie burger the manager came over and gave a whole spiel about how they ve had a really tough time finding quality organic antibioticfree chicken breasts that are reasonably priced so that s why they re serving this awful thing like the chicken sandwich the veggie burger also had tons of charred parts it also did nt really stick together like a veggie pattie should at least the sweet potato fries did nt let me down
the food industry is tough and these guys did nt knock my socks off infact they did nt even snag or give them a gentle pull food was bland and something was off i ll give em about months before they are out of business go to bryan s bbq in cave creek if you want good bbq
my wife and i and our two son have for years gone to haus murphy for christmas eve dinner we all have lived in germany for an extended time and a german dinner for our family and our son s wive and girlfriend so a christmas eve german dinner has become a tradition the year before last the woman who runs the place did nt treat us very well lrb a party of rrb we tried again last year and they treated us even more shamefully we all decided that our experience with haus murphy has come to an end it s a shame but each time the woman has pushed us impatiently to finish and we d made reservations for but none the less the lady did everything but put our order in a box and shove us out the door even something as simple as bread with dinner was with held perhaps any other time of the year but not on christmas eve if they do nt want customers on the th they should just close for the day
worst theater ever no wonder they are willing to only charge for a ticket i do nt know if we got a bad theater but my fianc and i sat in office chairs yes non reclining wheeling no arm rest office chairs oh and our tables or shall i say linoleum office cabinets what the heck  oh and get this the lights to illuminate your food are nt really blue they are white with blue painters tape over them most ghetto theater i have ever been sat in i ll never go back and hope i get a good theater
i hate this theater it really just sucks
long drive for a touristy drab area with not much to do
the stacy s on shea is closed
this is easily the worst golf course i have ever played there are several problems with it first of all it s a desert course not that there s anything wrong with desert courses but on some holes the fairway does not start until  yards off the tee that s fine on most courses but on this one if you do nt hit the fairway it ll be nothing but dirt and rocks no rough or anything on most long holes if you mess up the tee shot your hole is blown second the layout is dangerous especially on the back nine there is one spot where three holes more or less converge and you are right in the path of errant shots from not one or two but three holes you have to keep your eyes open or you can get nailed third there is no enforcement of pace whatsoever we played there during the summer and there was a line at the tee for most of the front nine in all the game took  hours to play which is ridiculous finally very few holes have yardage markers combine this with no gps and it makes club selection very difficult if not impossible it s tough to get an accurate measurement by eying it or using the scorecard the only redeeming part of this course is an island green on the sixth hole although i should note that it appears as if nobody bothers to repair ball marks there
the staff is rude and irresponsible and the glasses are poor quality the employees refuse to do their jobs and steadfastly refuse to do anything to better help you the customer it took them literally months to receive my glasses and after i called every week for a month they told me not to bother calling anymore because they would call me when they got them in finally after nearly months we stopped in to talk to them to see what the big holdup was and found they d had my glasses for almost a month and we were about to send them back if you did nt come in soon to pick them up i told them they had said they would call when they came in and asked why they would nt bother calling one more time before returning a customer s set of glasses and they indignantly refuted my claims saying no one had said any such thing when i tried on my new glasses and needed to have them adjust the fit they were too busy chatting to each other about gossip to pay any attention to me or to any of the other customers in the store every time i asked them to make any adjustment they sighed made it without really even interacting with me and continued their conversation the whole time a few months later after we moved out of state we called multiple times to request a copy of the prescription so that we would have it for our records they refused to give it to me citing a different false reason every time save yourself the headache of dealing with this company and get your glasses and contacts from a real vision company
the worst service i have ever had in my life i arrived at pm and was seated at the bar we received our drinks menus napkins with silverware at pm we were not spoken to until pm yes that was hours and minutes later we were totally ignored for hours and minutes with our watered down drinks menus and rolled up silverware in napkins sitting on the bar in front of us not a word was spoken to us by any employee during the hours and minutes the only reason i would ever return would be to give them a bill for the time i wasted there obviously service is not the reason this establishment is still in business
disappointed in my experience in discount tire over the labor day weekend bought new tires and left the car with them took them over hrs to put the tires on the car which is longer than i have experienced in past visits got the car back in the late afternoon and drove it around for a bit the next morning i come out and two tires are completely flat i fill them back up and can hear the air leaking out of the value stem which is usually due to faulty installation of course these guys are never open on sunday and monday is a holiday so i m stuck without my car for days maybe they will make it right but pretty much ruined my long weekend
i honestly do not understand peoples infatuation with this place the fries are terrible and the burgers are barely edible i have tried several innout burgers to make a fair assessment and they re all nasty
these people have no idea what they are doing as a person who has grown up eating the best bbq lrb meaning choppedpulled seasoned pork shoulder rrb in the us lrb in eastern north carolina rrb of course i am going to be a tough sell but i was open and very disappointed the meat on the pulled pork sandwich was not pulled at all but rather sliced and in chunks further to that it was dry and tasted like it had been cooked over a gasoline flame yuk this place is great if you have no idea what the offerings are supposed to taste like i feel bad as i write this review because the proprietors and staff are so nice but between the dry chunks of gasoline flavored pork and the spoiled sweet tea do nt waste your time
extremely boring tacky music choice rude staff makes me miss my usual hookah bar in california if you are so inclined as to go do nt take josh s recommendations on the best flavors so gross
i came here because i wanted to get a manicure i like to get gel nails as soon as i entered i was welcomed by the owners i asked them if they do gel nails and they told me that yes then i double checked do you do gel nails  uv gel nails  they confirmed i sat and a woman started working on my natural nails to prepared them then she took a little jar with powder and i told her i don want acrylic nails i want gel nails the whole nails made of gel she told me that that powder was the gel cmon i told her that when i got my nails done in ca the technician did nt use a powder so she realized that i knew what i was talking about and told me the truth that she does acrylic first and gel on top since i was already in manicuremood i accepted to continue with the acrylics when she finished doing my acrylics she painted them with a color of my choice and then added a coat o shine not gel she made me put my hands into the uv lamp to continue trying to trick me at the end i was so po that i just wanted to get out of that place lrb she made me a discount over the price of a full set of acrylics rrb so this is a very affordable place to get your acrylics unfortunately i did nt want acrylics and i did nt want to be treated as a fool
first visit was last visit tried it for dinner nice setup outside with table and chairs very pleasant one person working cash register and creating the food orders  not a great idea in my opinion the ingredients are all contained in a subwaytype bar and then assembled before you problem is nothing was fresh tasting or very appealing in general maybe it s different at lunchtime but i wo nt be back to find out when i need a burrito fix i m going to chipotle the owners of kokopelli need to do the same and they will soon understand  it s the food stupid
so my wife daughter and son went to firebirds with moderate expectations it was about pm when we arrived the hostess was on the phone and with a smile puts one finger in the air and puts her head back down a manager comes behind her lrb she makes sure not to make eye contact with any of us rrb then turns around three other serves lrb who had nothing in their hands rrb walked right passed us i said to myself hmmm i hope the food is nt as bad as the hospitality after standing and staring at the hostess for about six more minutes we were seated our server forget her name was genuine in her service that s about all i can say she forgot our caesar salad lrb which is pretty bland rrb but the crotons are ok i ordered the aspen sirloin midrare texture reminded me of those stretchy hands n feet you used to get out of those little quarter machines back in the day and it tasted nothing like beef straight salt so i reordered the filet mignon now i understand that it was on the fly but there s no reason the center of the filet should be under degrees none the center was cold i mean cold by this point i m starved and just ask for two minutes on each side so the manager lrb yes the same from earlier rrb drops off my plate and it s clearly obvious she hates her job and should nt be there especially in a management capacity so after getting my medium steak back it was wrapped with a nasty slimy attempt at bacon i d give the steak itself lrb everything else aside rrb a i ask for a glass of malbec and the waitress looks at me with this perplexed look and goes ummm what s that  lmfao i m sorry you re in steakhouse and the waiter does nt know a red wine when she hears it  so after its all said and done my bill is presented no gc no taking care of my daughters plate glass of wine nothing i m not a moocher by any means but being in the industry i know i would never ever place an untouched bill in front of my guests who had the experience i had even if offered i would have probably turned it down but it s the principle show that you value your guests they do nt pitiful management going on there nothing special about the place if you love commercial food and do nt really care about wasting your dollar then this place is perfect for you oh in there defense the salmon my wife ordered was pretty darn good and the sauce was well made hence the nd star had it not been for that and like i said our genuine server lrb whom i left on an lunch rrb i would take away a couple stars never going back
came here for a double date once and it was awful both the date and the food service was slow and inattentive the food was subpar and the sushi was lukewarmish which is just wrong when it comes to raw fish the place was loud and obnoxious way too much like the other crap along mill avenue i tried the neighboring location just up scottsdale road and it was definitely much better if you hate yourself and want to get sick go here if not keep walking
my boyfriend and i were on a date sat night went to stand up live st then after to lucky strike for a drink my boyfriend ordered a vodka tonic weak so he ordered a double willing to pay whatever as the girl made the drink i did a drink count with her lrb i have been in the service for years rrb she just put in a larger glass and did a count i asked her about it and she said she did a six count and if we wanted more she would have to charge for a double plus another drink girl plzzzz i watched you learn how to count rude service i ll stay at copper blues thanks
i shop here because it is the only place to get what i need in biking distance out of times i am overcharged on my last visits it was for over i make it a habit to go over my receipt near customer service to collect my inevitable refund
room is supposed to be a nonsmoking room however there was a lingering stench of cigarette smoke and cigarette burns in the comforter and the chair internet access painfully slow the bed was the most uncomfortable hotel bed i ve ever slept in the toilet consistently ran all night none of the most basic amenities in the room upon arrival such as shampoo conditioner lotion coffee packets etc tv remote took a lot of figuring out on how to switch over from cable to the dvd player perhaps because i m a director of food and beverage for a large hotel i m overlypicky but overall i was very underwhelmed by my stay  not a star quality hotel in my view  ending on a positive note front desk staff was very welcoming and accomodating
we went for dinner with trepidation since past experiences yielded small portions this experience had the same issue with small portions sizes in addition to other problems the fried calamari appetizer was underdone and soaked in cooking oil the soup was loaded with lemon far too much for our taste the description of seafood shells led us to believe that it would be loaded with scallops and shrimp what was served were buttonsized scallops and a few microscopic shrimp inundated with a sauce that again seemed overloaded with lemon the chicken parmigiana was overloaded with chunky sour red sauce with a strong overtone of unreduced white wine along with undercooked pasta the overall use of the lemon on everything made it seem like they are trying to cover something up lrb old food  rrb we tried both the vanilla and chocolate tiramisu and neither came close to the definition of a tiramisu rather they were like sponges covered in sauce the positive note is that the server was very nice and attentive and the coffee was great but not worth the time nor the expensive cost
worst spaghetti and meatballs ever bar none it s like they were trying to make me send it back lrb it worked rrb the pasta was overcooked and tasted like it was out of a pack of ramen  the sauce was reminiscent of chef boyardee  and the meatballs were odd on the upside the service was very prompt and friendly
while i still have a membership here and it fits my schedule to go this place is getting worse yep  you guessed it more lockerroom woes is it demanding to expect cleanliness and basic accomodations when you are paying  and by basic accomodations i mean water and shower curtains and staff members that can stay off their cell phones long enough to acknowledge you lrb or the patrons they are training on the main floor rrb so the latest issue is no hot water for two weeks now excuse after excuse from the front desk mind if i bathe in a comfortable temperature after my workout  guess they do oh and if shower curtains get damaged it apparently takes a week to get more so you are cold naked in plain view and trying to shower all at once until that day i m no prude but it s not the most ideal bathing situation the sauna  breaking down on a regular basis now so having a place to stretch and warmup is a coin toss the plain truth is that the mens locker room needs to join this decade it smells it s usually always a mess and it s unpleasant it s ridiculous that they have so many members and so little resources to keep the place in order in one word blech i m probably going elsewhere very soon
i have had nothing but problems with this company ever since i sent in the orders for my second round of prescriptions they said the orders were nt filled out right then they said they did nt have the prescriptions i sent them myself they were able to fill one out and ship it the other two i canceled my doctor is getting up in age and his memory is nt so sharp so trying to get him to handle it is nt so easy unfortunately humana sucks so my options are limited i will be going back to the old fashioned way walgreens
this was my first and last visit to quiessence lrb aug rrb rrb the power lrb  ac rrb shut off several times lrb approx rrb yet management did nothing to compensate other than an apology after the st outage rrb the  per person price of the  chefs spread appetizer was far too high for the minimal amount of food provided it took over minutes to arrive yet nothing had to be cooked lrb  rrb rrb the entrees took over minutes to arrive rrb in when the bill arrived they added an automatic  gratuity for two people  i ve discovered that this standard operating procedure this is wrong and defeats the purpose of the gratuities the server have no incentive to provide good service lrb as was apparent from our long waits rrb the fact that the gratuity was also charged on the bottle of wine lrb more on that later rrb deplorable rrb when i look at the bill i saw the wrong bottle lrb and a pricier one rrb was charged to my bill we had to ask another staff member to get our waitress lrb who seemed to have forgotten us rrb she did take change the bottle but should this have been necessary at the prices charged by quiessence  rrb yes i know quiessence is on a working farm so they should reduce their prices to reflect their setting lrb and poor electrical service rrb this should include better lighting for the path from the restaurant to the parking area i am severely disappointed with my dining experience at quiessence i had been looking forward to dining there for years the overpriced appetizers poor service nonapologetic management and the  slap in your face automatic  gratuity makes me wonder how quiessence could survive especially in this economy other similarlyprices restaurants would simply not allow these issues to exist
i should have read all the reviews before sitting down to eat well it was pm on a sat night so you would assume that everything would be fresh shame on me for assuming things the soups were horrible and looked they had being sitting there all week the pizza was nt even pizza but crust with sauce on it the iceberg lettuce was a mixture of lettuce with chunks not even cut up yet i love souplantation  sweet tomatoes and i have high standards for anyone else tryiing to be a salad buffet i would have given this place a half a star but the manager was nice enough to refund my money so it gets one star
thus pf changs goes the way of all restaurants always a fan of the restaurant even with their exorbitant prices well as long as the quality lasts alas the quality has crashed down to the quality of your local chinese takeout the two beef dishes mongolian beef and wokcharred beef both contained an unnecessary amount of fatty beef the unedible kind sorry pf if that s what i can expect i do nt have to pay your prices
i do nt know why this place has such rave reviews one of the worst places i visited recently samosa sucks tikka masala was blend lamb korma and lamb boti masala was worst biriyani tasted like tomato rice with chicken what the hell
i never went inside the store after driving there i had to park more than halfway down the huge parking lot and when i got near the entrance here was a car parked right in front of the business with signs on it advertising their suitcase business it would seem only logical that the spaces near the store would be best used by potential customers i wo nt return
it breaks my heart to write this review i ve loved los dos molinos for many years  the alma school location and south mountain location have always been reliably good i was severely disappointed with the downtown location on washington my dining companion and i were excited to have found one of our favorites closer by our first sign that this was nt going to be up to the excellent standard set by the other locations was the bad margarita very bad dining companion said it reminded him of pinesol he was right weak and tasting very heavily of bad margarita mix we were trying to regain our enthusiasm when the food arrived things went from bad to worse seriously underdone almost crunchyhard rice watery beans and lukewarm entrees i ordered the bluecorn cheese enchilada with red chile not the gooey cheesy delight i was expecting the cheese was almost nonexistent the dish was barely tepid both in temperature and chile heat unlike previous dining experiences which left my mouth with a slow burn this did nt even register on the heat scale service was terrible  we never saw our server again once the food arrived even had we decided to express our disappointment we decided to cut our losses the owners would do well to spend some time over here we wo nt be back
pappadeaux used to have this oreo cookie mousse dessert thing it was the best dessert ever in this world ever then they stopped carrying it so now i wo nt go back i protest pappadeaux
crooks fake and phony between my husband and i we paid over in work to only have to have it redone a year later because it was nt done correctly my crown fell out less than a year after because there was no tooth left because they did it uncorrectly my husband had a ton of work done that did nt need to be done and it was nt covered under the insurance even though they were billing both of our insurance companies for it please stay away for your own good
i recently had a terrible experience at the bevmo on i  ray i ordered a keg of premium beer for a th birthday  the transaction went fine but when i went to use it the keg put out foam all night i did everything i was supposed to do from keeping it cold to tapping it correctly we ended up going to fry s and just buying beer for the party when i returned the keg  explained the issues nobody cared i spent over on this keg they said they ll check it with the company they get it from  see if it was bad  the manager would call me back still waiting i will never shop at bevmo again after getting no compassion or a call back stay away from this store
food and service are a joke there is a reason their food is in the freezer isle in fact the food they serve may have come from walmart
started going to logans some years back and i really enjoyed it there everyone was nice and the food was good i d say in the last year it has made a real turn around the people are nice but just like others have said you wait and wait for service and when it does come its not very good the steaks that i use to like here now taste like mush it doesnt even taste like your eating a steak and i like mine med rare and thy cant seem to understand what that is have ordered fish that was so over cooked i couldnt eat it not only was it over cooked it was cold not warm cold if you want a good steak try texas roadhouse off of i
oh dear what has happened to rawhide and the steakhouse  i ve been taking my kids to rawhide for thanksgiving for the past years and always had a wonderful time this year the kids wrist bands to go on the ridesattractions were still but the train is gone and the stagecoach was mia for hours so we spent per kid for them to ride a burro the service at thanksgiving dinner was the worst i ve ever seen hungry kids waited an hour and a half to get kraft macncheese and cold chicken strips my thanksgiving dinner was so cold i sent it back the waiter brought out bill lrb at the hour mark rrb without ever offering us coffee or the pie that came with dinner three conversations with a manager got us no better service sadly this was the year i brought friends with us so a party of left determined to never return
there store is huge and seems to have all the sporting goods you can think of i had stopped by weeks ago to look for running shoes i was in hurry so i was hoping to go in quickly find a pair and be out of there the store was nt too busy and there were or employees in the shoe department now the shoe department was busier than the rest of the store i look around for a couple minutes good selection good prices i find two pair of shoes i m interested in trying on and grab them so i can have a sales associate grab them from the back stood there a minute i was ignored tried flagging two associates down as they walked by  ignored it s like i was invisible i did nt have time to wait so i left i came back again today this time with more time to spend i found pairs of shoes to try one grabbed them stood around again and waited ignored even when i tried to wave someone down i went and sat on a bench and tried some of the new reebok runtone shoes that were on display since these were one of only or maybe styles total that had a whole size run of the shoes to try on i sat there on the bench open box of shoes on the floor my shoes on the floor new ones on my feet and display shoes on the bench next to me i was never even so much as acknowledged one employee walked briskly by me i said excuse me can you and he walked right by me to greet someone else the guy he had greeted had a single pair of shoes in his hand i had actually looked at them before choosing the i was interested in trying and they were cheaper than anything i wanted so whats the deal  i had showered was dressed well my clothes were clean i did nt have an screaming children with me i know i do nt look like i m there to buy shoes for my next marathon or anything but regardless i m there to buy shoes i am there with money to spend too bad these employees are either too useless or too stupid to realize that
worst car wash in townlocked my keys in the car manager was a complete waste of space no apology no sense of urgency and could barely function avoid i asked how i could contact the owner and the cashiers said we are not allowed to tell anyone 
i just spent a lifetime at einstein in attempt to grab a bagel to go after what seemed like an eternity i started timing the process  minutes to get a bagel to go  the place was clearly mismanaged  orders were taken at the end register rather than the first counter causing a long line of grumpy customers we were asked twice to move out of the way to allow an employee to wheel a large cart through the line to restock orange juice why she had to use the cart to carry orange juice was a bit of a mystery  i can only assume it was yet another attempt to annoy their already displeased customers when i finally reached the register i found a grumpy woman who repeatedly mumbled something at me that another customer finally interpreted as toasted  after paying i was shuffled to an area filled with people standing around arms crossed frowning in the final phase of this farcical adventure as orders were ready yet another unhappy employee barked out descriptions of the items ordered  thereby causing further confusion among the angry crowd finally  my order was ready and not at all worth the wait i will never return to this einstein and will instead take my business across the street to bagel nosh
i have had similar issues like jenny r and sara b i am enrolling into cgcc fall and i was a mcc student last year so i assumed everything would be updated across both schools which is how they make it seem cgcc was charging me out of countystate tuition so i called and was put on hold for mins i was told that my account would be updated class started a few days later and i was able to log in with no issues when i logged in on day two i found out my class was dropped so i spent another mins on hold trying to resolve this issue the rep said she watched her coworker update my file with the correct in countystate tuition i am now showing as enrolled but it is going to take up to hours before i can access the online course through blackboard i am so tired of people that can not do their job if the second rep could put me on hold for mins to resolve this issue why did i have to go through this at all  i am going to take my class and hope december comes fast luckily i have completed my undergrad degree and i am just taking a course to help with my job skills good luck to the other students that are just starting
i was visiting some relative in the area and stopped at this starbucks i visit a lot of starbucks and this store seems poorly managed the wait was minutes for our simple order after we paid the staff were more concerned about drive thru customers who paid after us than our order there were no tables inside so we went to sit outside as we were sitting outside the manager intentionally shut off the misters when it was degrees he claimed they stopped working but they mysteriously shut off after our neighboring table complained about the poor service
i stopped here for fuel and a car wash on my way from the gym to work the other day my car was in desperate need of a bath and i did nt have time to visit my favorite cobblestone car wash in scottsdale because i did not want to continue to drive in shame i figured a nice little rinse at the quick car wash would at least help a little my car is black and was so dirty it was starting to look like it had a nice gray primer coat on it when the soapy cycle of the wash began i noticed something flying above my car to my surprise i looked up and notice several pigeons riding back and forth on the car wash arm to their credit the pigeons looked quite happy going back and forth back and forth i think one of them smiled at me lrb a side note where there are birds ready to poop they will find me somehow i must have a poop magnet somewhere around me because it always happens rrb i am already stuck in neutral and it s still in the soap phase of my wash so i sit and wait i count how long it takes before one of the birds craps on my freshly rinsed car of course within moments of the dryer beginning and the green light flashes i notice a nice little white pile on the hood of the car to make things even more enjoyable the dryer smears the freshly deposited prize across my hood after all who wants wet pigeon poop on their car  moral of the story peeps if you want pigeon poop and a car wash this is the place to be i was in a bit of a hurry so i did nt ask for my money back however i did make a courtesy call later to kindly remind the owners of the gas station that they have some squeaky clean pigeons living in their car wash they did nt seem thrilled with my sarcasm
if i did nt have a big pizza in front of my face i would have thought i ordered a big serving of attitude with a side of screw you maybe it s because we came in with a coupon but this place had more ego than a minute celebrity not to knock small family owned places lrb usually i love going to places like that because usually you get a friendly family feel rrb but for a pizza joint located in a shopping center next to albertson s they sure wanted to make you think you were eating caviar things not so awesome whomever answered the phone did nt know east from west to be able to give directions our waitress could nt give any suggestions on the food they ca nt do a half and half pizza unless you paid extra you pay a charge if you want to split a plate of food attitude attitude attitude tip was already included in our bill i ve never been to a family run pizzeria that ca nt do a half and half pizza and the only restaurants i ve ever been to that charge to split a plate of food are ones where you d feel more comfortable wearing a dress  definitely not one in a strip mall like this one i swear if the two waitresses rolled their eyes or huffed any more than they already did they probably would have fainted from lack of oxygen and vertigo and last time i looked i believe i was old enough to do my own math for your tip if you were so scared we were going to stiff you on your tip maybe you should learn a little something called cusstoemer surviss foodwise the pizza was not the best i ve ever had in fact it was a bit on the dry side i ca nt say it was absolutely horrible but neither can i say i was in heaven the wings were much better in my opinion for the pain of the drive and having to dodge eye daggers this is a definite nopeat
i so badly want a chicago style italian beef joint near my house  and though i live just a few blocks away  luke s of chicago is not it i ve been here twice  each time brimming with optimism at the hope of getting an approximation of the real deal both times i was treated to hard stale bread bland meat flavorless jus burnt greasy fries i am sure my craving will return at some point  and because loc is the closest thing in the area i am sure i will be tempted i am leaving this review to remind myself to not waste my time
since high school i had completed my own taxes but in the spring of i had metz  assoc complete my return and although the final price was significantly higher than what was quoted to me at my consultation i returned again this year to have them prepare my taxes after i had paid the bill of i was provided with a copy of my return on which i found several errors after the exchange of several emails i received this from mr john metz in the interest of getting this finished we will give you draft copies of your tax return and complete the return for an additional as long as you do nt come back i agreed to those terms and the very next day i received my final bill for
why does everyone rave about this place  the burgers are about the same as a fast food place the fries are not fresh as advertised but made from prepackaged frozen bags it took one minute to get my burger yet the place is busy a better burger joint is wood flame burgers
paul barzda is the general manager lrb see httpwwwdowntownphoenixjournalcomhobnobscoffeehouseopeningoctoberst rrb so i m betting that star first review from paul b was written by the new management anyhow i went there for the first time today i was nt expecting anything like willow house but i was still hoping there would be something worth visiting once and a while taking up their old location i did nt get that instead i got a coffee shop stocked full of pastries from costco many staff behind the coffee bar lrb all with name tagplates rrb only disposable utensils and cups made of styrofoamtype material i m pretty disappointed with the latte i had they were out of anything smaller than a oz cup to put it in so it ended up being mostly soy foam it also took a very long time to prepare for such a well lrb too many  rrb staffed bar i did enjoy the wood floor and the stained glass that was all over if you re looking for a quick blah coffee on the run or an over priced pastry or sandwich practically from costco than this place is a pretty good bet otherwise i d pass
we stopped here on the drive between tucson and san diego because we were starving and when we looked up restaurants close by on the gps it popped up when we first arrived we were really excited by the giant flying saucer on the roof but once stepping inside our excitement turned into mass disappointment as it looked like the kitsch factor was not well not really kitsch and more of what some large faceless corporation would hope you would think kitsch is i m looking at you best western our host was quick and friendly and we were seated promptly there were only parties beside us in the massive restaurant yet our waitress explained that food would be delayed because there were tables ahead of us ummm what  full tables out of is like a rush for you  food came and it was pretty gnarly looking but being starved travelers we dove right in the first bite lead all of us to believe that we made a horrendous mistake and should ve waited for the next town or braved the generic bk drive thru rather than sit through this meal rice was ordered by out of of us and we both agreed it was like old rice with new rice that had nt been cooked all the way thrown into a food processor and served i ve never eaten rice that was both hard and mushy and looked like corn meal the beans were most definitely from a can and massively over salted i ordered cheese enchiladas but never did find the tortilla is was supposedly wrapped in as the entire entree was cheese and canned tomato sauce my dining and traveling companions also were disappointed in the a rrb angus beef burger patty that was not anything better than a dried up patty mcdonalds would nt even serve and b rrb chicken enchiladas were dry and crumbly my brother pulled out his phone and looked up the yelp reviews on this place immediately he exclaimed that we all stop eating and leave  which we were much relieved to do since the food was so terrible an overwhelming amount of reviews were negative and even included instances of food poisoning which we were feeling the starting effects of even before we got back in the car to be fair the service was friendly and responsive but we all wished we had skipped this restaurant completely and i never give bad reviews but this one is truly worth it
this store is super close to my house so i shop here for the convenience however their service is awful they have a bell to ring if you get good service more appropriate would be a foghorn to blow when your service is bad it would sound like a fleet of ships were coming into harbor maybe then they d have a better chance convincing us their fish was fresh
by far the worst food in all of arizona if not the nation nothing more needs to be said buyer beware
i am a little confused as to how this place got so many good reviews perhaps i went at the wrong time i went to sakana for dinner and not only was the service pretty bad the food was disappointing as well our hostess was impatient and forgetful everything at sakana is just a variety of a the california roll and they are super generous not in a good way with the imitation crab if you are nt too picky about sushi and are itching for some rice and imitation crab this place is definitely the place to go
i was very disappointed when they would not let me use my restaurantcom gift card for the full value and would only let me use it for half it s value i did not get a chance to try the food since i canceled my order after that i was looking forward to trying it out but will be taking my business elsewhere in future
me and my husabnd are from rhode island maine and we went to oscar s pier fish and chip s in glendale arizona sometiime in december as we were visiting the area and we wanted some good fish well we received the worst customer service from the owner of the establishment first of all he yelled and chewed his cook out for messing up on an order in front of us as we were looking at the menu it was terrible we felt very uncomfortable after that we ordered our food and then it was terrible our fish was extremely dry it was not fresh at all our french frie s were very greasy and when we brought it to the owner s attention he refused to give us a refund as a matter of fact he asked us to leave the premise s we will never go back to this place what s wrong with the state of arizona  is this how they represent themselves  this owner seemed so egotistical  that we feel so sorry for his employee s 
i visited this pl for a simple car wash but the guy sold me a full detail for clay bar engine wash interior shampoo wax he said it would take hours but it took and i m so disappointed about the quality
this was the worst mexican food i have ever had by far i would give it a minus star or two if that was possible had to pay extra for a beef machaca option on my chimichanga and i expected shredded beef with no fillers there was huge pieces of piping hot tomato and bell pepper inside and the meat was flavorless and watery my wife was asked if the would like sour cream  guacamole with her dish lrb which was also not meaty and very watery rrb she said ok  they brought two tiny containers we also were charged an extra and were not informed of that i am from california and am almost years old so i have eaten a lot of authentic mexican food this was garbage in it s highest form the place also did nt smell good and was dirty amazing they have been in business this long the prices are also very high for any restaurant especially one with this poor quality
i was a walk in they were not busy at all and they sat me with the new guy in training not sure why you want to put a walkin with someone in training but they did he totally made my nails thick  for a full set with natural nail color its to add gelish on top it was an additional he never disclosed the upcharge and i paid for bumpy and thick nails when i got home i had to file them down smooth them out then add gelish to them again lrb since i own gelish at home and know is a ripoff  an entire bottle costs rrb since the appointment lasted hour and mins and the ladies doing pedicures were obviously noticing the inexperienced man s flaws i decided to pay and just leave  i called later to provide feedback and that i will not be returning again although i have been going there on  off for about years now and the manager didnt take my call i told the person on the phone about my experience and she translated to the manager who didnt seem concerned horrible service from inexperienced nail tech  this place has gone down hill over the years and newer salons are worth the slightly added cost
i do not recommend taking your vehicle here i went here for two years just for oil changes every time i go here they are all about highpressure sales they do a courtesy check even if you do not ask for one which sounds great but its just a ploy to get you to purchase additional services their paperwork is automatically set up with two signature lines  one that authorizes the service you came in for and one that authorizes the additional services they ve managed to upsell you on i take better care of my vehicle than anyone i know takes care of theirs i had my oil changed on wednesday and then drove miles round trip to work on wednesday and then again on thursday on sunday evening my husband noticed there was something strange about the way my hood looked he opened the hood to find the air filter had been removed from its case and placed on top of the case one of the services firestone had recommended was replacing the air filter they said they would do it free of labor and i d just have to pay for the part my husband replaced mine miles ago so i said no thanks my husband will take care of it when they called me on my phone to let me know my car was ready when i went to pick up my car they mentioned something about my brakes and i said my husband did them completely the week before lrb he did all new front brakes using parts directly from the manufacturer of my vehicle  new rotors pads antisqueek backing plates and all rrb and that they re good they asked whether he d just bled the breaks or whether he d done a complete flush of the brake system they said that if he flushed the brake system they d last longer and that they could perform this service i do nt know anybody who flushes a brake system when they do brakes not any shop or individual not to mention my husband used dealer parts and i have a feeling firestone would not have not to mention they might have forgotten a part or two kind of like they forgot to put the air filter back in my car i was driving on back roads in the desert for that mile round trip my engine could have been seriously jacked if something harmful got into it without an air cleaner there could still be ramifications of their neglegence in the future please do not take your vehicle to them mistakes are part of being human forgetting to put an air cleaner back into someone s car that you were not asked to inspect or remove  that s ridiculous gross negligence no matter how you slice it go to a small establishment you trust do nt risk your vehicular investment
i am an artist not so familiar with stamps the owner was extremely unfriendly and unhelpful including eye rolling lrb on asking a question about the atc group rrb and lots of pointing to where i could find items vs showing i asked if i could go behind the counter to look at a project for an upcoming class and was told no it was so odd i asked her if she was joking  she said no this is my space never offered to take the item down to put on the counter so i could see did nt matter i had already decided that an art environment is to be fun and inspiring not a place to get yelled at i will always drive to mystic paper in mesa or the paper store for a better atmosphere better classes and prices
who d have thought that you should have packed a lunch to go to a food festival  we did nt even bother eating at any of the trucks it was so crowded and the lines were nt moving that we realized trying to eat lrb the purpose of going to a food truck festival rrb would be a futile test of patience my friends and i cut our loses short and bailed immediately it took about an hour to get through the atrocious parking situation and walk to the entrance even after that we left after just one quick lap around the festival being charged to enter was robbery i m not even sure what we paid for since every truck and booth was charging someone must have pocketed big from this ripoff thank goodness we used a groupon to get six tickets for if i had paid a ticket i d be furious long lines are expected at a food truck festival but those lines should move
let me preface this review with the fact that i m chinese and i know my rice so after a meeting next door  hava jave lrb review for that place to follow rrb a friend and i wandered over to zen for a pm snack boy was that a mistake i normally eat up at celsius in desert ridge so i thought i d get the same food down here to compare a couple of the rolls we ordered viva vegas roll caterpillar roll the service was just fine but honestly even if i had angelina jolie serving the food naked the food would still be crap and the rating would still be an uno star the rice seemed like it was dayold rice it was clumpy and honestly i do nt know how a sushi chef takes clumpy rice and puts it into a roll so anyway due to the clumpiness of the rice the vegas roll was loosly rolled so it fell apart when i tried to pick it up the caterpillar roll tasted super bland which is very hard to do because it includes so many different ingredients like eel faux crab avocado cucumber and eel sauce not only did it taste bland it was also poorly rolled again the service was nice but you might want to bring your own sushi if you re going to eat here
i booked this hotel as a aaa member and the rate for a king nonsmoking room was advertised in the auto club tour book as per night however at checkin we were informed that this resort would be adding a fee to the room rate we were somewhat shocked at this tactic since it seems like a lowbudget strategy to take to guests we later reported this obvious misrepresentation and fraudulent conduct to the auto club should you be on the road and want to stay at this place you can talk your way out of the twentydollar surprise fee if you are up to it lrb we did rrb aside from the above situation our room was very clean and decorated in southweststyle decor lots of soaps gels conditioners etc for guests our nd floor room overlooked a traditional spanishstyle courtyard with a lit firepit only other thing was the partying noise in the courtyard below that began about pm and lasted until am a number of twentysomethings in the hotel lobby and courtyard were the cause of the noise they appeared to be locals by their accent and attire however this is just my guess
i wanted to like this place i really did i vaguely remember going here with my mother often when i was young to get ice cream and dinner and apparently i remember it being much much better we showed up on this hot winter day wanting some ice cream and some burgers we had a cranky two year old who had not eaten and had not yet had her nap upon first walking in we realized it was busy as there were plenty of butts in the seats and not enough people running around taking care of them understaffed  surely not lrb sarcasm if you could nt tell rrb we gave them our name and a larger party came in behind us they were sat before we were and still we stood tapping our foot with our child growing more and more unwieldly finally we were taken into the play room area yes there is a small arcade off to the side where children can obtain tickets to buy little bobbles our two year old was instantly interested upon being sat and handed some water both daddy and daughter were running around with a fresh dollar to find some fun i made sure to find out what he wanted before he left so we could order quickly quickly did not come daddy and daughter returned before the server showed up finally she did show and i ordered our food and some ice cream for the baby food took about as long as i figured it would with a busy kitchen and many patrons i was not very impressed the food was alright and definitely not worth the price the ice cream was also not impressive as i have had much better at gspot or even cold stone yet it was comparable in price to these two places as i said i wanted to like this place i was feeling nostialgic and only wanted to experience a restaurant that i used to visit with my mother with my child and her daddy and now i can say that i have and will probably never return in conclusion unless you have a good reason to check this place out do nt bother it s not even worth the nostalgia
looked like a very nice place to eat so we thought we would check it out one night all was fine until we got our food i ordered filet mignon well done because that s how i always like my steak and a friend ordered a steak as well only medium well well we both got our steaks and they were very rare and blood was pouring out when we cut into them disgusting i sent mine back and when it came back out to me it was charred so bad i could nt eat the outside of it they need to get a better chef
if you prefer a hip atmosphere to good food you might like this place
sure their branding is nice it has that feel of something hip and youthful which helps for a chain that tries to pass itself off as a local pretty colors and shiny things however do nt impress my palate i ca nt explain how much i detest food from zoe s fresh vegetables grilled meats  it should be a slam dunk instead their food is bland it is the inverse of food it is antifood annihilating the satisfaction of eating with every bite
earnhardt s chrysler jeep robbed me of my innocence i went to earnhardt s to test drive a wrangler and thus begins my first encounter with the demon seed known as earnhardt s sale s staff i was looking around the lot and checking out different versions and years of the wrangler when a somewhat smarmy but otherwise friendly salesman asked me if i was interested in a jeep i told him that i was but not interested in buying anything just a test drive he said that was cool and asked me which one so i could drive it i picked a white sahara he grabbed the keys from the front desk got a copy of my id and off we went it was nice but when he shot me a price of over k for the thing i balked and said not a chance so we went back to the lot and he suggested he take me to the back lot and look over all of the wranglers they had to find one within my price range at this point i did nt know jack squat about how much one should cost because i did nt expect to buy anything but i played along we finally found one that he told me was in my price range lrb i did nt tell him how much i wanted to spend so how did he figure that out on his own  rrb and so had me test drive that one instead it was nowhere near as nice as the sahara but the sticker said k so it was nt as much of a shock to the system as the k  was even still i was nt really interested at that price undaunted in his quest for a commission he asked me if i had a trade i said uh yeah his eyes lit up like a kid on chrismas morning well we could easily get the payments as low as you want them with a trade let s go run some numbers i replied um no i m cool i ll just take my car home then he whipped out the phrase that ensnares hapless first time car buyers across the country into their web of highpressure sales what could we do to get you into this car today  i said a payment below now anyone who was nt as naive as myself at the time would know that no matter what the salesman says at this point there s no way you can finance for a month without rolling it into a year mortgage regardless he assures me that that is possible  to make a long story short lrb too late i know rrb after hours in a torture chamber filled with sales managers closers and finance guys i drove off in my bone stock wrangler se at a payment of and a really bad headache they told me i had gotten a great deal so they must be telling the truth right  much like a bad onenight stand everything looks much different the next day with the lights on too bad it took me a year to really scrutinze the deal they gave me they sold me a jeep that was listed at for with of what was labeled additional dealer markup in tiny little print at the bottom however since i never looked at the sticker myself until long after the sale i did nt see it my dealings with their service department have been equally lackluster and i have warded all of my friends family enemies religious leaders professors random strangers and pets to stay away from earnhardt s the only good thing i can say about earnhardt s is that they have a huge stock if you must visit them find the model you want in their inventory take a test drive and then go to another dealer and get that car from them no bull  yeah except for the worth of bull on the sticker price
first and foremost i do nt get it why do people think margaritaville is cool  it s not it is a chain that plays predictable music people yap on about the atmosphere but hawaiian shirts and pretending like we re on vacation is nt a very hard concept to come up with i have nt been forced to eat at this location yet lrb and am hoping to avoid it with all that i can rrb but i have drank here a few times it is almost always busy on weekend evenings and there is a live band on those evenings the live band does play a random mix of musical genres on the weekend which is nice because i might go insane if i had to hear all that buffet nonsense all night long drinking here is expensive nothing is ever on special and the bartenders do nt know how to make drinks that taste good the other night i was craving a long island so i indulged myself the drink was horrendous  it taste like a vat of sour mix my friend said to me i never order anything but beer here for just that reason and it all made sense to me i also recall ordering a round of shots on one occasion that were probably half of a regular shot glass and a piece insane i realize that there are often lines at the other better choices in westgate if you arrive too late on a friday or saturday night so unless you are in love with this whole ridiculous margaritaville concept get to westgate earlier
remember where you came from what i mean is i ve been going here since they were still painting the walls and hanging pictures there is a crew of us that live in the hood and frequented there lately the service has severely lacked it s like they re doing us a favor by serving us a pasty is a pasty but bad service will shut you down kick your servers in the ass and get back in gear
the happy hour prices were decent but i d be willing to pay much more for better service waitress was not very friendly and our drink orders were few and far in between you ca nt really screw up chips and salsa but this place had greasy stale tortilla chips and very mild and somewhat old tasting salsa you could probably find better food at a school cafeteria
this place is way overpriced for such casual dining and not so great food rolls are extremely small sashimi seemed like it had been sitting out and was served on a stinky bed of something that smelled like it had been rinsed in dirty sink water there was no kids menu so we were charged fora tiny teriyaki bowl that again was not very good i could have got a better rice bowl from jack in the box btw this is the first review i have ever done on a restaurant but leaving this place left me so disappointed i felt i needed to i would never go there again
i was so excited to see them open at n th st scottsdale az they had good coffee  friendly service and my favorite maple bars that must have just been the opening team now the grumpy service  no maple bars lrb the maple donuts have frosting that never sets  what a mess rrb  the only thing that remains is coffee  but i say that is not enough silly of me to rate them because i m not going back
i spent for pick up two lunches i paid extra for a dinner size of rice  beans what i got were portions for an infant this is not the first time but is the last the food is not bad but was cold like really cold no plates forks or napkins and every thing is wrapped in tin so i could nt microwave plate would help im not going here anymore very
i found this place on hotelscom and booked one night so i could fly out of phoenix early the next morning got in at and asked if they could check me in early lrb i figured this was reasonable since i saw the maids already in the process of cleaning two rooms rrb  and was told the earliest i could check in was pm  really  now i know they do nt bend over backwards for anybody who gets a deal over hotelscom since they re not making a premium amount but you have rooms available dude we were really busy last night and wo nt have anything until not even  no earliest is unfortunately so based on them being filthy liars star in addition the entire room was in need of a complete overhaul from the toilet that was nt completely caulked in to the leaky shower that points in the direction of the curtain and does nt move and the fact that you have to swipe your room key exactly right to open the damn door yes you heard me it literally took me tries to get into the room the front desk just laughed and said yeah we have the same problem i mean you do nt have to fix it or anything so based on them being idiots as well star for a grand average of star
closed you ll have better luck finding something to munch on at the savers next door dust bunnies anyone 
a nightmare dealing with jeff hanson was truly a disaster he was the most rude and unprofessional person i have ever dealt with i would caution everyone before doing business with these people they will lose your order and what they do nt lose they will screw up and then they will not take any responsibility whatsoever this was a terrible experience i do not recommend doing business with arcadia window  door and especially with jeff hanson
will say anything to get your business i signed up for a system years ago and was assured at that time that it was a year contract when i just checked the expiration date with they so called customer service they wanted to know why i wanted to know then informed me it was a year agreement i will be finding the original paperwork and hopefully can shove it down they re throats customer service is lousy english is a second or third language for most if the alarm goes off they call you and ask you if you want them to notify the police even thought they know that the alarm is in another state i would not recommend them to anyone
this place is gross i do nt know how they stay in business the hot dogs were nothing special i can buy hot dogs from the grocery store and they taste better the fries were okay a bit greasy they only take cash and i do nt carry cash so my brother had to pay for us out of the of us that went none of us liked the food never going here again
sad the photos on the web and other media are from when this place was built just stayed there and wow what a crappy motel i say crappy motel as it was like a motel dirty carpet mold and mildew in the bathrooms terrible servicesarcasm from staff erroneous fees on a incidental card lrb over rrb for no services redered stay away also you have no opportunity to speak with management and they will continue to say they are not in perhaps that is why this place is run like crap no managment around
shame on the owners of haus murphy s for participating in the sham of a tv show mystery diners when the producers promise free publicity and you so easily lie to the public  that is not a business i will support the manager under scrutiny on the show was an actor  not a relative and not a manager the show the conversations the issues all phony entertainment is one thing but i do not respect this at all
poor service on weekends and my togo order was messed up will never come back here
run do not walk from these guys i sent a request for quotes to area dealers lrb via online services like pricequote and invoicedealers rrb the first problem was that i started getting duplicate emails with cmon s and then i received emails from tonelli then john lloyd i d ask one a question and the other would reply when will you be coming in  when i finally received a quote from them it turned out they quoted last year s price lrb cough our real price is way over what other dealers quoted rrb i heard earnhardt has a bad reputation for playing games like this it came as no surprise when i experienced it
union hills and th ave location i went to roberto s or of times the food is pretty good nothing amazing though the staff is nt too friendly on my last visit after i ordered and was waiting for my food i noticed i never received a receipt and was over charged roughly on my order thinking back i realized i had never been given a receipt during any of my prior visits i did nt even bother saying anything i guess the tips i left in their tip jar just were nt enough when i got home i went onto their website but no contact email was listed i then tried calling their restaurant in anthem a few times to possibly speak to a manager no answer no need to say i wo nt be back
this small out of the way cafe suffers from many problems not the least of which is an indenity crisis it does nt know whether it is an office lrb the manager s desk is in the dining area rrb a cafe an ice cream parlor or a kitschy antique store the store had no real antiques just the sort of craft work one generally finds at the swap mart the menu is that of a brunchery with french toast omlettes egg dishes and baked goods sounded good unfortunately the execusion is where this cafe fell flat the sausage and cheese omlette was obviously microwaved instead of being prepared in a pan on a stove topped with a single slice of american processed pretend cheese the french toast tasted very much like it was taken from the freezer and popped in a toaster bacon and sausage were of the lowest order the bacon being so thin you could have read the paper through it and possesing no actual flavor at all the promised homemade biscuits were such a disappointment that they went unfinished i have had better biscuits at mcdoanlds honestly and mcdonalds makes dreadful biscuits overall we were extremely disappointed in this little cafe and became even more so when the check arrived the total price for this disaster was almost the same as if we had gone to a real resturaunt but without any thing that approches the satisfaction one gets from dining on good food the waitresscookmanager very cheerfully gave us discount coupons for our next visit we left them sitting on the table the food was actually so disappointing and we ate so little of it that we then went someplace else to have our breakfast if you re hungry and are thinking about stopping by the apple dumpling cafe for a bite i recommend mcdoanlds the food will be cheaper and not microwaved and be moderately better tasting  well a few days after posting this review i received a meesage from an owner of apple dumpling cafe and after due consideration i thought i d add my response to that message here as well i will use their statements then respond to them promotional comments have been edited out also i should like to point out that the location we visited is now closed and they have a new location in queen creek adc we have been in the restaurant and catering for years yes everyone has some off days at apple dumplings we cook everything up fresh no cooking items and keeping them warm fresh eggs not powdered or liquid eggs dbabh now between my wife and myself we also have nearly years of restaurant experience everything from family dining all the way up to star restaurants we know what good food tastes like this was nt it adc maybe you are not used to baked biscuits instead of warmed microwave ones dbabh being a native of the west i have had my share of delicious tender and tasty biscuits from campsites to local restaurants and no the biscuits at the apple dumpling cafe do not qualify they were of poor quality and neither tender nor tasty adc our business is growing in queen creek our apple burger has been called one of the best in the country by many dbabh i am sure the business is growing and that is a good thing but the new location is far enough out to discourage this reviewer from giving them a second chance at the apple perhaps if i were in queen creek one day for another reason i might stop in but given the low quality of food we received on our first visit i think the odds of that happening are long indeed
this place and scottsdale as a whole has really changed for the worst lots of ghetto attire and a crowd that screams be ready for a fight  what happened to the scottsdale of old that was trying to keep up with la 
being from chicago we are used to getting authentic chinese food all the time but when we first starting spending a lot of time in scottsdalephoenix we found it a challenge to get authentic chinese food we were excited to find the golden buddha and have made many trips over the years all the way from the troon north area to get our fix however service has declined to the point where it is no longer worth the aggravation we went there last night for chinese new year and will never go back granted they were very busy because of a lot of large tables there but waiting almost an hour to get our food is not acceptable under any circumstance mins into our wait the waitress came back lrb after we flagged her down to ask about our food rrb and said one of the dishes we ordered was not available after mins what makes the whole experience an unforgivable one is that the managerowner is so indifferent and never apologized or offered a discount off the bill nothing when we left the same manager was at the piano singing in chinese huh  other than nee house in scottsdale the search goes on for a restaurant that serves authentic chinese food closer to home
this location is of the poorestrun johnny rockets locations in all of phoenix right up there with az mills avondale arrowhead norterra and especially the location at westgate where the cardinalscoyotes stadiums are they should really consider changing their style of delivery when it comes to how they approach customers the food is unhealthy and the service is lackluster at best epic fail
i took my and  year old for her very first hair cut i was very excited to find such a cute salon until i saw the ending result of the cut unfortunately i had the same person cut my hair too what a disaster i had to go some where else to have it fixed never never never again
this location is a hot mess i love the cheese cake factory but this locaton is not up to the standards that i accustomed to from this company choose another location the waitress smelled like a pack of cigarettes so standing over me taking my order made my stomach turn then my rice was undercooked when i told them it was undercooked they wanted to question me and say are you sure im asian i eat rice almost everyday there were nat s flying around the food i wo nt be back to this location
animal cruelty  how do you keep our national bird in degree heat yes our beloved national birds on the ground beaks open literally gasping for air their cage was tiny they are nt canaries i m not peta but this is animal cruelty and this is just plain unamerican also it was nt just the bald eagles that were in pain  there were plenty of animals suffering under the heat if you care for animals even in the slightest bit do not go to this zoo and take action i am and will continue to do so
poor service and very poor food chicken in the fajitas tasted expired would never eat here again
this is the place for you if you enjoy rude staff from the moment that i walked into the nail salon i was treated as an inconvenience no greeting terse no smile i should have walked out immediately but i desperately needed a pedicure i was quoted for a pedicure when i got into the tired looking worn out chair and started the pedicure i was asked to pay an extra for callous removal obviously i could not just walk out so i was stuck as the massage chair beat on my back i received a quick quiet pedicure no conversation it was obvious this guy hated his job everyone else received massage scrub ect this was supposed to be included in the price i did not receive this i guess i should have spoken up but was not impressed and wanted to leave asap since it was not relaxing or good quality the callous removal did not get all of the dead skin off of my heels lrb they were not that bad i use a file daily rrb so afterward i had to come home and do it myself my nails were cut uneven and they did a terrible job on my polish with all of the nail salons in anthem this is one to skip
came here with my family on a friday night and the place was empty not a good sign we had a restaurantcom certificate which we had printed that day the manager refused to honor the certificate saying that they were no longer a participating location not sure where the mix up was but we were not going to eat at a place with no one else hope this saves someone a trip if they were planning on using a restaurantcom certificate  do nt waste your time
i begrudgingly came back to tranzylvania after successfully staying away for over a year a friend wanted to check it out so i obliged the thing that puts a huge damper is the ratio of security to patrons it seems like for every patrons there is a security guard i felt like an absolute criminal as they shined flashlights everywhere scoping out the place waiting for some big fight where they can flex their muscles the alcohol selection is very limited and this place was pretty dead all night while i found the music better than my previous trip here i have to yank stars for the serious lack of atmosphere and feeling like i was being chaperoned all night
yuck i had a chicken wrap and it was very dry chicken seemed like it was frozen before and it was burnt service was ok and the booth is sat in was very broken in i had to sit on the wooden bar in the middle so i did nt sink in the long island iced tea was very stiff
pricey little sandwich joint and cheap atmosphere that s the best way to describe this place indeed my belly was full  full of bread where s the beef   oh the s my sandwich was mostly bread lettuce and tomatoes the clam chowder was probably the delight of my meal lrb sandwich  soup combo rrb could nt complain much about the service since it was quick the place was super cheap on the decor  though i did appreciate the helicopter ceiling fan think i enjoyed that more than my sandwich  enjoy
i rarely write reviews good or bad but i was so shocked by my experience that i had to share it with fellow yelppers i am a vegan wether it is by choice or because of food allergies is besides the point in my opinion firstly my mom went in to grab a table and no one had come by the table for drinks even after i had already parked the car came in and was seated for over minuets it was not busy so i was not empathetic when it takes over minuets and my moms fianc to get up and ask where our waitress was this is where the drama begins finally she comes over and at this point we are ready to order my mom and fiance place theirs and i ask the waitress if there is any way to get the spring rolls without shrimp lrb the menu says shrimp with vegetables rrb and she responds they do nt come with shrimp so i point it out on the menu tell her i am a vegan and she replies it does nt come with shrimp i do nt know why the menu would said that its just vegetables and stuff i ask her to double check for me she grabs our menus and walks away later comes back with the drinks and a menu and says i ca nt guarantee they do nt come with shrimp so here is a menu i really wanted spring rolls so i ask her to ask the manager or chef if they can make them without shrimp she comes back and tells me they are premade and i cant make any special requests i say i am surprised they premake their spring rolls but that i will take a cucumber salad and a cucumber roll no mayo please lrb mayo is commonly put on sushi rrb then the manager comes over lrb i did not ask to see a manager rrb and he tells me the mix is premade and it would take to long to make the spring rolls fresh and that they ca nt make me spring rolls without shrimp lrb are you kidding me too long they are making rainbow rolls back there and deep frying tempura rrb i tell him that i am simply vegan and ask what would he recommend he says the vegetable roll i order that with no mayo and he does nt even apologize that he ca nt accommodate me and just walks away she brings out my cucumber salad i take a bite and notice it has imitation crab in it which is cod fish normally now i do nt even complain or tell them to take it back i just offer it to my mother but i am surprised because right before i ordered it i said i was vegan so here is strick two this waitress does nt know the menu items and what is in them i am not high maintenance at all i did nt complain send it back or ask for it to be taken off my bill later they bring out my rolls and there appears to be mayo on the vegetable roll now forgive me for being worried and not trusting of the competence of the people working here i ask the waitress if this looks like mayo lrb i point it out rrb and she looks at it and says to me thats kinda green it is avocado so i look again and i am still not sure but i just say ok and she walks away i could not believe she did nt take it to the chef to be sure and was completely rude and short about it for all she knows i am allergic to eggs and shell fish and if i took what she said at face value and did nt challenge her lrb the shrimp or mayo rrb i would have taken a bite of a spring roll that would put me in shock and id have to be rushed to the hospital lrb if you know about shell fish allergies its as bad as peanut allergies rrb and a rash from the allergy to eggs lrb mayo is made of egg whites rrb lucky for them i have no allergy to cod fish and i did nt complain about it in my cucumber salad either now what makes this worse is i went to loco patron earlier that afternoon for lunch and to me that is just a super casual sports bar that serves mexican food lrb they also have mac n cheese and fries rrb they were way more accommodating far less rude and made me the most amazing mexican vegan plate i ve had since becoming a vegan too so cheap they even accidently brought me a side of beans with cheese took it back and took it off my bill i did nt ask for that i was just polite and they were sorry about the mistake rrb i have family in scottsdale grew up in scottsdale and worked at local restaurants zipps oregano s nypd pizza to name a few i am not some stuck up bitch whos daddy pays for everything and complain when nothing is wrong i worked in the restaurant business and know that this was ridiculous and i could not believe this waitress knew nothing about the menu and the manager was such a chump i have lived in los angeles for the last years and i know veganism is more common over there but this was just ridiculous i will never go there again my family will never go there again and none of us will recommend going there they were just plain rude and who wants to eat pre made food at a sit down restaurant at least jack in the box does nt make it till you order it wtf
i was not only blown away by how uninterested the girl was that was teaching this cookie baking class this novermber but how rude she was to the only male that was in the class with us it was like she was extremely upset that a man decided to take the class and treated him rudely the entire time i was bothered by it the entire time not only was i bothered by it but myself and other girls all told him after the class that he should ask for his money back and he should i would not recommend the sweet basil classes or cooking school to anyone that is looking for a pleasurable experience as the blonde lady who teaches the classes lrb i believe her name was melissa rrb seems absolutely miserable and unhappy with her job hopefully the owner reads this and takes note
they use to be great but i think they re under new management the place needed upkeeping while employees were hanging out talking without greeting customers customers needed help and they were nt approached they even announced over the speaker your girlfriend is on the line they no longer offer the cat food i purchase in a case so i waste my time counting out cans i asked the employee about this and his response was the manager wants the cases open location is great but i d rather drive miles to the next closest petco to me
the store can be bigger but they have great customer service my boyfriend and i were kicked out last july for something that we still do nt know what we did we made a complaint to the hr in texas they were doing an investigation and we havent heard from them back at all i was wondering does anyone know who the store manager at the tempe location is now  i believed it was eric but i wouldnt be shocked if he got fired for that cuz he approached us off of whole foods property claiming we did something to his store
they promised they would have my car fixed in under days from massive hail damage instead they had it for days i had to pay for two weeks of car rental out of pocket because they took so long then it was nt fixed right and i finally had to have my insurance agent step in to force them to do the job right very unprofessional and i will never bring them my business again
gross my warm sandwich was cold no meat cold cheese cold veggies hardly a cheesesteak did nt even ask if we wanted anything else on it i will not be returning gross
i d never heard of this place but when last night on saturday hipster dance party night not knowing what to expect here s the scene a sprawling german restaurant with a dance floor lrb why  i have no idea rrb a pool table and a maze of woodpaneled rooms that reminded me of an elks lodge inside about sweaty indie rock kids sloshed on cent well drinks the bar was nine deep in an effort to stock up on this deal which was really a lame excuse for a nonpour by the bartenders when i order a gin and tonic and they use the crappiest gin in the place i expect to at least get half a shot of alcohol not so there was about four drips of gin and a swimming pool of tonic in there i could have had of them and not felt a thing good thing i only spent to be honest i m not sure what the draw is of this place perhaps i should go back when it s in restaurant mode and eat some sausage but the dance rock night is total lameness next time someone wants to hear crappy techno in an uncomfortable environment i ll recommend this place
if you know exactly what you want and do nt need to speak to anybody then maybe go here i have been in twice and on both occasions left an armful of goods behind that i had selected because of my inability to get anybody to help me with other articles the staff seem to go out of their way to avoid you the place is totally understaffed you have to beg for help and then get a nasty look for interrupting a conversation with another staff member if you need help with bike accessories  forget it they have a so called bike specialist who both times was not in and nobody else in the store knows a thing the line i was given is that they are trying to find staff are you kidding me in this recession you ca nt find good people the best was when asked upon leaving the last time if i found everything i was looking for and saying no there was nobody to help me the answer i got was okay they do nt give a darn about customer service and do nt deserve your business the worst part is that seems to be a common theme if you look at the reviews for other stores btw both times i was one of only  customers in the store
myself and two friends were really looking forward to our experience at palatte and unfortunately we wasted our time first of all there was a minute wait for brunch at but we were ok with that there was live music and it was a beautiful day to sit in the courtyard and wait we enjoyed some lemonade and coffee while we waited then as time went by we realized people who arrived after us were getting seated apparantly we got skipped over by the hostess nonetheless once we pointed this out we were promplty seated the fritatta of the day is one of their specials and the meat fritatta was on the board it sounded delicious and i knew from the start that is what i wanted when we sat down we ordered amongst other things the fritatta a tuna melt and another lemonade turns out they are out of lemonade the server then returns to inform us they are out of fritattas as they usually run out by noon i suggested that perhaps if they always run out by noon to make enough to last until or take the special off the board if you are out either way i decided to settle for a tuna melt as well but what do you know  they were out of tuna too if you go to palatte the atmosphere is quaint but bring your patience and a sack lunch
i have been a member of la fitness since and the camelback location is nt much better than the northern location although i hear they are completely rebuilding northern every time that i would work out at camelback the equipment was busytaken and i would have to alter my workout routine which i am dedicated to so after having to use random machines and messing up my workout routine i decided to use the tatum facility not much better very dirty busy  people watching  it s a gross meat market i want a workout not to be checked out and judged thank you village you are my new home
i know little about windshields glass glass repair etc i was referred to american glass by tempe auto repair lrb whom i really like rrb when my wife s car had a cracked windshield the crack was getting dangerous and needed to be fixed american glass is close to our home and after the referral figured that this was a good decision i called and left a voice mail to set up an appointment no call my wife called again a few days later and the owner said there was no voice mail and maybe i called somewhere else she was nt very friendly i had the business card and heard the american glass message i know where i called should have been my first warning my wife did take her car to get the window fixed as this needed to be done rather than shop around any longer this process went pretty well and the windshield was fixed the same day the big issue was dealing with my insurance company and american glass this process could have been handled better within a month of the windshield being repaired a rock hit my wife s windshield again and left a ding my insurance company lrb state farm rrb advised us to contact the glass company to repair the windshield as this should be under warranty and be fixed without cost or little cost we contacted american glass and we were told that it would not be covered and we would have to pay for a new windshield at full cost the woman was not very friendly in her handling of this issue hmmmm forget that state farm informed me that any reputable glass company would stand behind their work and offer to fix the problem state farm then provided us another provider to correct the ding in the windshield lrb my wife will write a review on this rrb i would suggest that you go somewhere else when getting a new windshield repaired etc i can only warn others to steer clear of this business and the woman who runs this place
i waited for the store to open at am the day after christmas but they had the same discount they had before christmas so shop other stores a crowd of people were milling around the front of the store speaking to the manager asking why they did not make down the christmas merchandise as they were told it was going to be marked down by store employees before christmas quite a few people were told the same thing yet the manager did not handle this very well and quite a few people walked out shame on you garden ridge
i recently used their self parking service for a trip to the airport the rate was the cheapest at the time so i foolishly made a reservation the place was easy enough to find but everything else was horrible the shuttle leaked and was dripping directly on my head the person at the desk did nt have any of my information ready and did nt even know what questions to ask i had to volunteer information so that i felt they would nt tow my car the leaky ride to the airport took much to long because they transported one of their workers lrb who was filthy and smelled like a mix of urine alcohol and smoke rrb to their other location before dropping us off at the airport they gave me a business card and told me to call when my plane landed and they would pick me up i did but it took them over an hour to pick me up meanwhile i saw shuttles from each of the other parking places pull up multiple times one place sent at least shuttles in that same time it sent them to send one pay the extra dollar or two a day and park elsewhere
we went to lunch here for the first time after passing by it s of times we went on a tuesday afternoon at it was busy but not too crowded this place is not vegan friendly in the least all of the sandwiches have some sort of dairy in them as do the soups you can make your own sandwiches but i can make a sandwich with cold veggies or sauteed veggies with mustard at home i would suggest offering grilled zucchinieggplant with a sauce that is dairy free all of the sandwiches are placed in sacks with plastic utensils and styrofoam cups even if you eat in this is not eco friendly my pasta with marinara lrb which i can make at home rrb came in a nice plastic togo container while i realize this is not a restaurant per say it would be nice if they had real forksknives and plates if you plan to eat in and get something more ecofriendly than styrofoam i did ask if they recycled before we left and was told that the kitchen does which is great however there is not a recycling container in the restaurant for the sacksutensils or pasta togo packages i will not be returning to this non vegan friendly non planet friendly sandwich shop and would not recommend it
we had been anticipating the opening of this restaurant for a few months now we went last sunday apparently two days after their doors were open to the public we went in around for a late lunch and as we were greeted the server informed us that they would nt have any pho for another hour since that s what i usually get at a vietnamese restaurant we decided to come back another time as we turned to leave someone told the waitress that it would be ready in half an hour we decided to give this place a shot we ordered egg rolls and their bbq spring rolls it took forever for the egg rolls to come and when we tasted it it seemed like mystery meat to us i took a picture and uploaded it the bbq spring rolls also took forever to come but were pretty good do nt know why food took so long since there were hardly anyone else there finally the pho was ready so the server came to take our entree orders we ordered chicken pho and combo grill with chicken pork and shrimp on vermicelli noodles lrb choice of noodles or rice rrb there were a bunch of dishes that were not available lrb beef pho for example rrb due to their soft opening once again the food took forever to come out normally with pho you get a side dish of basil bean sprouts and sometimes cilantro but nothing came with my pho here the grilled meat would ve tasted good if only they did nt over cook everything not to mention that it came with rice lrb see pic rrb i inquired with someone there and i think they did nt understand english so they brought out who we assume was the owner she said that because it s a soft opening they did nt have noodles i guess if we were warned that this was a soft opening and that they were not fully prepared at all at least we d have lower expectations we tried to order dessert and whaddya know it s not available highly likely that we wo nt be back even though this is the closest vietnamese restaurant to us my first thought was how can they run out of food when the asian market is a few doors down  too expensive for what you get and the dining experience is horrific the server told us that when they have their grand opening in two weeks or so that things will be much better i m not sure i believe that
i walked in with very high hopes and walked out very disappointed it really reminded me of one of those weird grocery stores in london where all the food is prepackaged and icky all i really wanted was a head of lettuce and some nice produce i walked out with nothing everything is packaged i had know idea this place is anything but fresh easy yes fresh no i will stick to trader joe s
this restaurant probably has to be the most overrated india eatery in arizona went with my family for a weekend lunch buffet and was thoroughly disappointed the food was stale and the service was really bad the fact that our waiter who waited on us had a frown on his face the whole time that we were there made the experience even more horrible ca nt see how others keep going back to this place  lrb have to agree with elizabeth l about getting some good indian food in phoenix
horrible service its sad to say this but when you are going there to watch a football game and you cant even get a refill on your drink because your waitress has gone and disappeared and doesnt return to check on you i waited and hour for me to get a drink i waited minutes just to get the check she aslo said that when she came back with the check she would give us raffle tickets to put in never came back with those tickets i think this girl should be fired i was upset to the point were i got up and walked out she didnt deserve a tip but i gave her one her name is angela i was there on the night of the super bowl game i will be back to that restaurant no doubt but i cant believe that someone would hire someone like that horrible service
i saw so many great review on zinburger we had to come and give the turkey burger a try yuck i mean it was so disgusting we had grease running down our hands lrb how do you get so much grease in a lean meat like turkey what s the point rrb then my husband had to catch a flight where he ended up belching the entire time with an upset stomach i know the review sounds harsh and i really hate to give such a low rating but honestly it was the worst by far i have had for turkey burgers and a total disappointment i thought it was also in poor taste to see some of the wait staff two tables away laughing and counting their tips and playing around i wont be coming back just not worth the effort
having lived in chicago for years i was hoping this would be something special the food was dull we told the waiter we wanted certain things but wanted something with some flare we all got basically small amounts of boring food for a lot of money i could do btter by buying fish and meat at costco and grilling them myself
first of all service was awful  from the cranky old lady who sat us and read thru a script of stuff while were trying to enjoy the view and start our evening we said thank you and gave signs it was time for her to leave then our waiter pushed the cocktails when we ordered a beer and martini and then he tried again later heard the waiters talking near our sections about some contest for drink orders but this place charges too much for the applebee s style service anyways the prime rib was good but how do you mess that up when you have lawry s in your name the fish was ewwwww and the rest was forgetable save you money and go somewhere else the only thing worth a star is the view staff was awful and worthless hopefully they close this place and put in a another concept in that great location
k i m not a fan of the neg but coldstones is my least favorite kind of icecream some people love it i do nt know what it is about the ingredients but it did nt taste right to me maybe because i m do used to real foods
if i could give this dump zero stars i would this particular rosati s is the worst in the entire chain the service is awful they frequently do nt have items listed on their menu  i m gonna take a guess that whoever manages this rosati s has about a th grade education remember the egg noodles and ketchup rat liota talks about at the end of  goodfellas  this is the place he was talking about
purchased a groupon for urbano and excited to try a latin fusion restaurant in old town scottsdale although the server was extremely kind and attentive we were sadly let down by the food it started out well with the ambiance and lookshabby chic we had the complementary fried plantains with spicy pico de gallo and chipotle mayo which was very good we then had the beef and potato empanadasthey were light and crispy but beef  potatoes were kind of bland they were good when enhanced with the pico  mayo we also ordered the green chili burger which sounded very promising but was more like a picnic burger w  a store bought sesame seed bun and flavorless meat it came with fries that had crushed pepper parsley cotija cheese and were completely boring in taste the spices did nt compliment the already dull fries we also had the fish tacos that sounded divine but were fishy lrb tilapia rrb and fell flat all these dishes had going for them was the spicy pico de gallo needless to say we will not be back and would not recommend this place
well these days it is difficult to find anything positive to report about an airline us airways delivers nuts and bolts in an average way lrb meaning the plane works technically and delivers you to your destination for a reasonable price rrb mostly on time they could stand out from this averageness however if they would not make so many nickeling and diming efforts for example the seat selling techniques applied are just downright counterproductive when checking in on line all seats except the preassigned center seats lrb different rows even though we bought tickets together rrb were this of course to compel you to spend another to sit with the wife lrb yes since there was no purchaseable seat right next to one of the preassigned centers psychology anyone  rrb then we were almost late at the airport but still went to the underused checkin counter we asked if we could sit together result reclining exit row seats for free in a halffull plane then we proceeded through the half empty airport and found out that we could actually go on a hr earlier plane which was not full however the representative at the gate wanted per ticked to make this change again the nickel and the dime do they realize how bad this looks  letting us on would not have cost anything but would have left us with a happy memory corporate numb nuts anyway we went for coffee saved the and went on the booked plane ca nt be nickeled and dimed more from the us airways front lrb  rrb it appears that they are stepping up their force people to check bags to collect more revenue efforts sitting at the gate the loudspeaker blasted something like if your bag exceeds the size box and you will not check it right now but wait until we detect your outsizebaggagesneakingin attempts at the gate when boarding you will be charged for the bag when we check it in  very nice several people immediately ran to the counter and checked their bags lrb for free rrb then when finally boarding my bag was singled out and put towards the sizer it was slightly too thick and the clerkess immediately blasted this must be checked but then she got distracted and another lesseager clerkess winked at me and indicated me to move on the plane lucky me bottom line it ai nt getting better in those  friendly skies fly southwest if you can
i hate to write this review but what happened on july st at lunch has made absolutely sure i will never eat here again we went in for lunch and it all went wrong on so many levels it took them almost minutes to get us chips and drinks it took another to get our order then just as our food was coming out they had the audacity to ask us to move to another table as our food came out we had the lonches and the bread was so stale that you could nt eat it i have never ever had this happen anywhere in the world its considered sacrosanct in the world of food service that once a customer is seated barring an emergency that you do nt move the patrons yet a group of land roving manatees with bad prison tattoos garnered enough respect in this place to get the manager to force us to move now if you do fuck up this badly during a service you comp the meal and you apologize this is scripture when it comes to food service and you do nt defy this logic yet no apology no offer to make it right no nada i will never go back to la condesa we ve been eating here loyally for two years bringing in others to eat there going out of our way to vouch for this place things have changed and not for the better i suggest you skip this place at all costs just not worth the bs and rude treatment to even risk it
disappointing we asked the waitress for suggestions and she provided a couple of suggestions including the starred pollo margarita waitress recommendation star on the menu highlighted in red must be good right  wrong the chicken was dry the potato cake unimpressive the seasonal vegetables were okay this dish was so not very good that my mom who hates wasting food refused to help me finish it she hardly ever says that she does nt like a dish she ll usually just say oh its different or its okay but she was pretty straightforward in expressing her displeasure at this dish this place is a bit overpriced service was just okay and the food i could have done without i do nt live in the area but even if i did i would nt come again nice people just did nt care for anything else
food ended up decent but not great star is because there was no soap in the mens rooms and the manager lrb who i found out was the owner rrb shrugged it off like it was no big deal i m not sure if this the same restroom the employees use but if it is i m pretty sure that bad for the health code and i asked for no onions and second later he put onions on it not the end of the world but he lrb yes the owner rrb just was nt paying attn
tastes like mexican food made by canadians it was so far from anything that i think of as mexican food i wo nt be back
hello the place is called sauce the pizza is dry food is terrible right around the corner from my house we were a group of and we all hated the pizza will never ever go there again yuck do nt waste your money would nt eat there if they gave me free food
they now close at pm instead of pm i am taking away another star
i took two of my friends there who are here in phoenix the first time and the service was terrible the noodles and other dishes were good as usual but the service we received from the guy was otherwise that guy talked very fast which did nt bother me as much until he started forgetting our requests he stopped by to check if we needed to refill the green tea in couple of occassions but never did it until in much later time when we asked to split the bills in two in certain way it had to be done three times it just gave me the impression that he did nt really pay attention to what we wanted this is the first time i went back since last year lrb rated  previously rrb hopefully he will improve his service and attitude or else they will lose more customers
staying at the homewood suites across the parking lot wanted to watch the kings game so how perfect was this walked inside they were busy but not slammed waited waited and waited counted about servers walking around no host  walked down to the bar no contact well that s about enough of that walked right out i m patient but common you got a bus running around town to pick people up but do nt bother with the ones that walk through the door
 for cheese sauce on nachos  are you kidding me it was part of the nachos last time i was here should nt nachos come with cheese sauce my family will not eat here again
while i do not disagree that the staff there is pleasant i had the unfortunate need to use their services for a small wound that needed stitches and my regular vet was closed i walked out with a bill for over this is completely ridiculous buyer beware that in times when people are having to make cutbacks in their budgets this office is contributing to people being forced to not seek proper care for their beloved pets please seek reasonably priced care elsewhere
rice was very grainy fresh wasabi was nt chopped wasabi and was charged extra for no uni lrb not like one should even consider eating uni here rrb above average prices all sushi came out at once rolls with weird looking and tasting vegetables like marinated peppers and weird tuna tataki roll miso soup there is no seaweed in it salmon was ok but nothing spectacular one of the rolls had lemon on top of the salmon for me there s nothing worse to ruin raw salmon than to put lemon on top of it toro mediocre at best i ve had regular bluefin that was superior to this overpriced bluefin belly lrb for nigiri rrb the vietnamese ice coffee while good and flavorful was not as good as it is in real vietnamese restaurants and really does nt belong on the menu of a sushi restaurant
i have been to this particular mcdonald s location twice now each time they have forgotten to give me my sauce for my mcnuggets of course this was after i left that i noticed and eating nuggets without any sauce just is nt the same
if there was a no star button i would have posted it i am not kidding when i say this place is a freaking nightmare i honestly felt like i was eating breakfast at the drury inn i soooo wanted to be excited about this place but i am extremely scared of this place first off it was sunday and i was craving pumpkin pancakes saw they had them on the menu via yelp well no reg menu on sunday s just brunch ok fine a person and you can get an omelet waffles lrb made to order cooking station rrb then the scary part there is a dining area set up with sliced deli meat potato salad lrb wtf rrb mini cupcakes and who cares what else i wanted to run for my life i ordered an omelet and all my veggies were raw in it disgusting to say the least my waffles took forever cause they did nt spray the waffle iron so it stuck i do nt have all night to write this review but i will not be returning for any circumstance
hated hated hated it wo nt go back and here s why tiny menu and  of that was breakfast some of our menus had to go stamped on them not a big deal but wtf  there is a chicken in the logo but only one chicken item appetizers  needed the waiter to explain what they were only one vegetarian dish on entire menu we had a party of of us ordered tacos they were all served together even though we were at opposite ends of the table it feels like this restaurant is just an experiment and if it does nt work they ll replace it again if you are going to do something commit to it out of a party of the best comment was the burger was good lrb followed by a shrug of the shoulders rrb i sent the owner an email letting him know about my experience got a snotty response saying things like we serve it one way and one way only btw let s be very clear the clarendon and the restaurant are separately owned and different experiences
i was very excited to try this place after reading the reviews but i must say after trying this place i will never return we ordered the pan pizza to go and it was so dry and over cooked we asked for a replacement pizza after returning to exchange our pizza the lady complains that slices have been bitten into there was of us eating and we all agreed the pizza was awful so we stopped eating our slices half way through the lady at the counter was so incredibly rude and when i informed her we would not be returning she responded good the pizza we were given next was average at best the crust was dry and hard and the cheese and sause was average very dissappointing for a place this is above average in price will not return
horrible the worst service no take out terrible attitude no english speaking totally annyoing place when i ate there the food was below average and no substitutes just the worst service unfriendly no coffee no refills mean waitresses hated it
went to see the sun devils game it took at least minutes to get a beer the server forgot my order twice and it took over an hour to get my burger and fries it took forever to get the check wondered why my stomach starting hurting a couple hours later noticed the next morning the other half of the burger was raw inside they did comp my burger but it was nt enough bad food bad service
well how many chances can you give a restaurant because you love the location or that it is own locally  well everyone talks about the sticky buns but that is the old days you must ask for them before they were just put on your table maybe the el chorro is having problems affording the buns the service from most of the females is poor i am a female have worked in a restaurant and family in az owned anthe staff ca nt seem to think for themselves or must not have the authority my friends had arrived before me party of ordering bottles of wine food arrived for happy hour but limited to myself  another friend arrived minutes after happy hour ended lrb we had to work rrb my friend whom was hosting the get together walked up to the waitress as she approached the table and said these are the two ladies i mentioned the waitress was quick to tell us happy hour was over i thought here we go i order a drink and appetizer and said you see it s only minutes after ca nt you see if our drinks would be apart of happy hour still our friends are ordering quite abite i ca nt she said try the manager prehaps to bypass the system she was nt going to i could nt believe it the above incident was after i had already experienced a problem another time i came in to meet the same friend but arrived early on another occassion i sat outside at the bar to wait order a cocktail there were two women to the right of me a woman to the left the women to the right ordered swimp appetizer to be told they were out because of lunch please order something else it was the first hour of happy hour the lady to my left ordered swrimp apprezier not from the happy hour menu she was delievered the swimp the other ladies and i noticed it and asked about it the female bartender whom said they were out response with they were out for happy hour we asked how were different she said they were but from different menu it made no sense i asked my bartender tim and he got the manager told of what happened the manager then went to both ladies and apologized give them the order the impression was made and sure stuck with all of us i went on my work web to report to over local rea estate agents what a shame for el chorro this is not the only incident lack of service surprising from only females go guys maybe you can save management
ate here tonight with my fiance service was good but the security randomly slid a garbage can lrb i wish i was making this up rrb into our table in the middle of dinner then minutes later lrb same huge bald security guy with a goatee rrb walks into my fiances and elbows her in the back lrb she was sitting at our table rrb no apology not even an acknowledgement in either incident it was like going to a restaurant run by the tsa will not be coming back
after the excruciating four hour long barrett honors college convocation ceremony my parents took me lrb new graduate rrb and my boyfriend out for celebratory bbq my dad talked lucille s up like it was better than pappy s in st louis he raved about the biscuits the ribs and the apple butter for days before we attended my ceremony and i was really excited to try the food disappointment does not even begin to describe our experience the restaurant was relatively empty at the time of our visit the hostess sat us at a table that could possibly have doubled as the freezer the ac was turned way to low on a relatively cool evening and i was shivering throughout my entire meal i know that this is nt the hostess or the waitress fault but my mom asked several times if they could turn up the ac or move us the food was terrible i ordered a full rack of ribs for and they were burnt to high hell paired with the ac my whole plate was cold in five minutes flat i ordered mac and cheese as both of my sides and that was decent my parents also split a burnt full rack of ribs and my boyfriend had an average tasting pulled pork sandwich we were served terrible quality food for the pricing of this restaurant our waitress was really nice but i think she should have noticed how burnt the food was that she served us i understand that we visited the restaurant at pm on a wednesday evening but their website showed that they take reservations all the way until pm it is just really unfortunate that this establishment does nt take more pride in their product people go to restaurants on memory making occasions and a bad dinner can ruin a good moment lucille s would do better to remember that in the future tl  dr burnt food terrible for the price will ruin your graduation experience
terrible just terrible poorly organized from the minute you drive up to the place where do i begin  the layout of the place is in no way set for a festival for hundreds of people the convenience shuttles were notsoconvenient as there were only operating for the hundreds of people needing pickup and dropoff lrb it was faster to actually walk back to our vehicle rrb the ticket line was convoluted and chaotic  there was no order to the line  one of the cashiers did nt have any one s so he motioned for people to get in another lrb socalled rrb line the balloons were never blown up as it was apparently too windy to inflate them lrb although the wind was minimal in my opinion rrb it s like  duh  do nt have a balloon festival in a place known for high desert winds and is in no way setup for hot air balloons the vendors sucked the band sucked the employeesvolunteers could nt answer any of my questions about the only thing good to come out of the event was that their beers were decent and you get to see the grounds of the carefree resort other than that  no thank you
glad this place has new ownership i should probably remove the review below its really harsh and does nt apply to the new establishment you have been warned  rrb  short review this place sucks balls long review we were supposed to meet a friend here at draft house on saturday night we were excited to be out on a datelike experience cuz its been a while we went to my inlaws for dinner and then headed to draft i knew it was going to be interesting from the sound of the music as we pulled into the strip mall the music good music probably the only good thing about this place  if you re a hiphop fan all hiphop all night the crowd ghetto fab all the way seems like everyone there is late s  early s lrb and some older sprinkled throughout the crowd rrb and none realize its not anymore expect to hear a lot of fake accents a la da bronx and a lot of misuse of slang terms it was entertaining until it became annoying oh and people will steal your seats or tell you they are saved  ugh the atmosphere small crowded small dance floor a couple pool tables but do nt expect to get one some tvs playing various sports which i guess qualifies this place as a sports cafe  the service omg we had one beer each and the line was retarded over minutes to tab out no line in sight just people crowding together trying to get to the front of the line oh and lol the bar tenders are total morons one of them complained to the guy next to us about his crappy tip and the other argued with his customer about whether they ordered rum and cokes or redbull and vodka the guy had already made the rum and cokes and was pissed that he got it wrong weirdos if any of this appeals to you this is your place btw her friend did nt show and we ended up going to skip n jan s to play some pool o rrb we had a great time there o rrb
gf and i were out to enjoy the piano bar and thought we would have some wine and an appetizer however we could only have the wine in the piano area so we decided to try the blue coyote cafe oh what a mistake that was she ordered a ceasar salad and me the bonesless buffalo wings and chips with chili con queso the buffalo wings came out cold and crunchy on the ends and appeared to be boxed food the cheese was already hard on the con queso as if it had been sitting i was hungry and tried to push through the misery of it all however could nt not only was everything cold is tasted horrible we complained to the wattress and she offered us a scoop of ice cream the manager came out and asked how things were and we told her btw the salad was terrible also the mgr said she would take the plates of food to the chef and ask him about it she came back stating the chef said he had both these plates out in a timely manner she treated us as if we were trying to get a free meal at this point we told her that the food was unacceptable and would not be back she acted the least concerned so in summary the food was over priced the service okay and the food you can do better at jack in the box we go out alot and will make an effort to tell everyone we know to stay away
i must have forgotten how terrible this place was i went in for lunch and ordered chicken lo mein for a huge meal must have sounded good to me at the time minutes go by and they call my number i open it up and it is a massive meal mounding in the middle and weighing a good  pounds i dig in and it is hot and has a decent flavor a few bites into it you start to realize there is almost no signs of vegetables or life the parts of chicken are not recognizable small and tied together with fat strings completely unrecognizable pieces of dark meat i m talking things that look like knee caps maybe a chicken elbow here or there  a few more bites of the noodles and white rice and specs of vegetables and i trash the rest i ca nt believe people can starve when they serve you this much food for under five bucks but then again after eating it one more time i guess i can understand why you would starve yourself if this was your only option i m done with chen wok with a capital d
i was at this location again yesterday and the staff still totally sucks this time while i was bagging my own groceries i asked the employee drinking starbucks coffee and chatting with his coworker at the next register if he could please authorize my wine purchase he gave me the stink eye and a totally sarcastic of course while rolling his eyes seriously the only job this guy deserves is standing in the unemployment line i m sure there are thousands of people who would appreciate having a job in this economy and i wish fresh and easy would find one of them and replace this tool
ummwtf  came here to grab some food and a drink first of all the place was dead and the decorvision of the place seems all over the place but whatever we seat ourselves after about minutes the server comes over and asked what we wanted to drink and then tosses some menus on the table while saying sorry guys we just opened we do nt have a fucking clue what s going on fine beers arrive the menu did not look impressive at all i ordered fries and gravy not much you can mess up there right  wrong how about saltless stale fries and gravy that tastes as if it crawled out of a can but this gets better server omg did you guys see that guy  me what guy  server the one that was just arrested outside  me excuse me  server oh yeah it was crazy he walked in here with his penis hanging out me what  server yeah it was just hanging out me ummm check please bad food  overpriced beer  and crazies  no thanks
stopped in recently for the first time since the new owners took over management staff and food has changed and not in a good way it seemed like the food is not as flavorful as it used to be and the staff spends more time with each other then with their customers the menu has nt changed much but the quality of the food and ingredients seem like they have it took me over min to order a drink at the bar the bartender and manager spent way to much time flirting with each other it seemed like the environment turned into the staffs own private playground why fix something that was nt broken bring back the old staff bands and cooks before its to late
my gripe is that when you serve imitation crab meat you must let people know seriously there are a lot of allergy sufferers out here and i am one and i do not like having an allergic reaction to something i should not have one to if you are going to serve nasty fly by night imitation food i really ca nt eat there sushi is sushi and it should be real and fresh enough said
great product store always tremendously busy however the representative who assisted me was arrogant disinterested with a huge attitude no reason for bad behavior in a sales environment my experience was certainly not a pleasant one
i have some friends coming into town for a fantasy baseball draft party we all hail from tempe so we thought we would check out this cool new hotel and see whether it would be a decent place to house a couple of our out of town guests ummm no the rooms are a joke and then the rest of the scene looks like the classic buttondown business hotel trying way too hard to masquerade as being all up in da club overall i d say there s some great interior design going on here but nothing else that i d want from a hotel lrb like spacious comfortable rooms rrb and as for trying to be trendy i d agree with the previous reviewer who pointed out that this freewaymeetsstrip mall location does nt seem like the place for hipness maybe if it were within walking distance of restaurantsbars but this is on the ugly end of the lake with very little going for it we chose to save a little cash and go with a more convenient location  fyi i probably would have given this two or three stars if not for the need to offset the apparently overzealous fans here but still location location location
oh i forgot how much i hate you you ve yet again managed to ruin another family vacation i promised myself the last time that i would never fly you again but somehow i forgot delayed due to a malfunctioning generator  really and now you want me to go hours cross country on you with my offspring i will never ever fly you again missing the az diamondback game was the least of my worries thinking that i was flying on an old decrepit plane yeah pretty much occupied my mind your staff is rude you did nt even offer us a free snack after delaying us for hours you made me want to write jet blue a love letter asking for forgiveness because i cheated with a lesser quality airline i will never fly you again and oh i wo nt forget
can i just say worst customer service ever basically a long story short we were charged for items that we did nt even order it was more then a hassle to get it taken off of the bill overall most of the employees were nice but the manger was a jerk wo nt go back
only god knows how this place is still in business the food is over priced and smells like an old folks home the menus are on their last leg and out of date not to mention the fact that they are trying i save a few bucks by keeping the ac off so it s hot as balls in the place service treats you like your the first customer they have had in a few months and last but surely not least their happy hour is a joke there are no drinks on special and the food well the only food on the happy hour menu is the sushi and you only get the happy hour deal for half price sushi if you order at least items off the sushi menu save your time and your money there are plenty of other places that will be better the most exciting part of our visit lrb we ordered drinks and left rrb was the cardboard cut out sumo wrestler
this sucked i m not usually so harsh but i have to agree with bev the lack of organization was hard to believe before you even make it in the door tickets were each and there was a parking charge luckily we bought ours on groupon and parked in a nearby vacant lot so we were only out total food lines were hour  many vendors did not even offer the samples advertised plus after waiting and hour  in line who wants to buy a sample and move onto another line  the vendors were not allowed to sell drinks they were all sold from a couple of central points by the park the equaled more lines and sever over charging  come on for a bottle of water  it does nt even cost that much at the airport they need more trucks or to limit the number of tickets or to time the tickets or something it took us about  hour and minutes to get pizza  almost hours to get frybread  almost minutes to get cupcakes no offense to the food trucks the food was tasty but it did not seem that any of them were prepared for this kind of volume my low rating is strictly to the organization of the event  not the food trucks themselves
sushi places are a dime a dozen in this town and in my mission to try them all i met a friend at stingray for happy hour the food was decent i ve certainly had better the las vegas roll was a little heavy on the rice and tempura the drinks were exceptionally good i had the asian blonde which is lychee and champagne ca nt go wrong there my friend s drink was something with raspberries and rose water it was amazing all that being said the service was awful once our food was delivered our waitress disappeared i got one refill on my water and considering that i drink water like its going out of style this is completely unacceptable my empty glass sat on the edge of the table for the remainder of dinner once we were done eating we could nt get the bill as our waitress was still missing some  minutes after we were completely done eating she appeared again and we requested the bill once the bill arrived it took the waitress an additional to minutes to come pick it up it was taking so long that i actually held the bill and credit cards up and out past the edge of the table hoping someone passing by would offer to take it or atleast offer to send our waitress over busboys went by the hostess went by several times other waitresses went by the manager even went by and they all pretended like they did nt see me holding the bill i ve never had such a difficult time trying to get someone to take my money  it was truly infuriating stingray is definitely getting crossed off my list i do nt have time for bad service
went to the gap event on sunday and was extremely disappointed most of the restaurants were chains or mediocre places that were nt offering any good food the lines were out of control and the place was so packed with people i was constantly getting bumped and having to dodge strollers and rampant kids even though it was only to get in the prices for food and drink were so high that we ended up spending way more than we would have if we had just gone barhopping in downtown scottsdale which is what we ended up doing when we left ironically the best food i had there was from los taquitos which is nt even in scottsdale it s in ahwatukee save your money its not worth what you pay
this place looks really nice the ambiance was great but the food blechk i ordered the lamb and it was basically just fat my beau ordered the schnitzel and it was salty our waitress was rude and our bill was lrb entrees a bottle of wine and appetizer rrb when we got home my beau was up all night throwing up it was horrible in their defense after calling several times they reimburssed our bill that was the first time i ve ever called and complained anywhere i used to be a server so i know how it is sometimes but this was just terrible
i really wanted to like this place s the owner was very nice but at the end of any gustatory transaction the thing of importance is the food maybe i should have heeded aileen s suggestion of going really early but instead i went there during lunch time lrb ish rrb i must say the mung bean pastry lrb mongo monia  rrb was horribly dry and hard which was the only baked good i tried of their fresh cooked fare i tried the pancit palabok and the vegetable lumpia the noodle dish was seriously bland and the noodles soggy the vegetable lumpia was dripping in oil such a disappointment sigh have to try a little further maybe jeppens
i received flowers today from my best friend for my birthday she ordered them through ftd and they were delivered by flowers i sent a photo of the arrangement with a thank you text to my friend and she called me immediately letting me know that was not what she order the arrangment consisted of gerber daisys it looked like a bunch of flowers from trader joes with extra greenery an embarrassing situation for us both glad we are such great friends unfortunately being new to town and knowing that this is what i can expect from flowers i will never order flowers from them
if i could give this place negative stars i would i have never been so humiliated in my whole life i was there on a sunday evening for my st birthday and they denied my id even though i had my social security card my bank card my school id and my medical card i was made to stand up in the middle of the restaurant take off my shoes sign my signature twice call my friends phone to show my name and still denied service at this point i was in tears as my two friends asked if we needed to pay for the fries we did not even touch and the manager said no as we left to go to dave and busters next door the manager from cadillac ranch had called there and said we refused to pay and we were not let into any of the surrounding restaurants keep in mind this was my st birthday i will make sure that no one i know will ever go to cadillac ranch
i give everyone a fair chance and i am a foodie and wine lover but i put the vig on blast i have frequented this barrestaurant in the past merely for their atmosphere pretty scenery and great patio  however more than a few times the service has been downright unprofessional and staff rude from time to time i was recently in the restaurant with a fairly large party and we all ended up with food poisoning from the hummus and baba ganoush i was nt so upset that it happened because it s a risk one takes but what happened after i will never forget after nicely calling the manager pam i only wanted to inform her of what had happened so that others would not get sick and she quickly became defensive and told me that it was impossible we could get sick on hummus sadly but true in my opinion she must have never taken a food safety class as most of us know bacteria can grow in protein and hummus is all protein she argued me and i quickly responded with the fact that eight people getting sick is no coincidence as a manager in the past it s right to sympathize with the customer not defend i wanted nothing from her but she quickly told me she would tell the chef and sorry hope you feel better and she hung up the phone this tells me the vig s management is not only unprofessional but downright awful i never thought their food was that great anyway and it s a step up from bar food but if you want drink menus tossed at your table long waits before being greeted rude staff and food poisoning then check out the vig if you do nt want to park in valet be careful parking in the check cashing parking lot because it can be dangerous crossing that busy street
weak this place is a far cry from the mill ave location in tempe gone now long wong s quality is lost on this place i had pizza and wings and my slice was literally microwaved to heat it up after i ordered bad bad bad wings have always been decent but there s really no reason to go there ever again
had flight from phoenix to salt lake that was delayed over minutes i got a call at am to inform me of this with a message this delay caused me to miss my connection by just a few minutes i had to wait an extra hours in salt lake they should have waited minutes since they were the ones late the salt lake flight was also late by minutes they gave me a voucher for a meal which is not even enough for a salad at the airport that cost the return flight was also late but since there was a hour layover i did not miss my connecting flight i they are late they should delay the connecting flight instead of making me wait hours delta treats their customers not like customers but like cargo this was my first and last time flying delta out of flights late not acceptable and they leave you holding the bag
i will never go back i went in for a mani pedi and ended up with a bloodied big toe and a sore thumb kim did both my mani  pedi and is a sadist or something she would not stop clipping away at my cuticles and for no reason my big toe started bleeding in the bottom left of my toenail after what felt like a shard of glass slicing into me and she had the nerve to look at me like it was my fault when i told her it hurt she applied liquid bandage  super glue to my toe but then pressed down so hard i was incredibly uncomfortable was that really necessary  i tried to keep my cool as i was with a friend getting the same services done but once she clipped into my thumb cuticles and made me bleed during the manicure i had enough i paid her for the services though i think it was inappropriate that i was nt even offered a discount and she gave me a second i hate you look when i gave her only  gratuity bad service and rude will never ever recommend them
the only good thing about this place is the location it s less than a block away from us airways arena we decided to eat at this pizza joint because we just finished watching disney on ice and my nephew was hungry the guy behind the counter was very rude and pushy on selling his combo deal which includes a slice of pizza salad and a drink for i told him i did nt want to order the combo deal but wanted to order a whole pie he says it takes about minutes to make a whole pie answer me this what whole pie takes minutes to make  since he made it seem that i had no other option so instead i ordered slices and two soft drinks each slice had to be reheated in the oven it took minutes til our pizza was finally ready to eat at least that s what i thought the pizza was extremely hot greasy and tasteless i wish i read the reviews prior and would ve just waited to eat somewhere closer to home with better pizza
the food is blah i ate there for a long time just because it is the closest asian restaurant but really the food could be better ok it could be a lot better a long time ago i used to love their frog legs but now they are so bad i cant even tell you the abundance of sauce ruined the crispiness of the frog legs i was so disappointed they raised their prices by  or more on some dishes  sides some of the prices have almost doubled for example the small rice was now it s extra the large was now it s it is something stupid but still annoying also it is hard to order food from them over the phone to tell you the truth i sometimes have trouble ordering food from them there because they dont seem to be able to communicate very well in english and you always have to double check your order the food is inconsistent it s not great but it s food and still fairly inexpensive i wont bother eating there again because their food keeps getting worse  worse i have had friends get sick from their food watch out for their chicken my friend said he got undercooked chicken from this place also they wont give out copies of their togo menu with the new prices on it so you kinda just have to take their word for it on the new prices it used to be a place we went often but it s getting to the point that i m kinda just over this place yah the more i think about it i m way over this place
i ve been here twice once for the grand opening and once more recently the first time everything went pretty well and the restaurant would have received a to star rating the last time i was there was with a party of we waited minutes for a table after being told the wait would be the only reason we got the table so quickly was because we asked if something had come available  our buzzers had nt gone off and no one had come to let us know something was available we were put in a corner where we were quickly forgotten it took over an hour to get edamame and two medium sushi boats once it came out we quickly ordered rolls hoping they would be ready by the time the boats had finished an hour later they arrived an hour for three rolls in all we spent hours at stingray and probably minutes eating the other hours were spent waiting the restaurant is nice and the sushi is good but the service was so poor that i would not go back oh and when the waitress finally showed up with the check she told us out loud that since we were a part of more than lrb i think rrb that an  gratuity was included automatically that was a bit audacious maybe she was just clarifying the bill but after her terrible service she is lucky that stoploss policy is in place or her tip would have been tiny
saw a guy smoking in the car while delivering pizza in my neighborhood called and spoke to a manager who says this is ok and that all delivery drivers are allowed to smoke i respect the fact that people have the right to smoke just not in a car while delivering food gross
absolutely terrible i am fond of wood burned pizza do nt get me wrong but the wait was atrocious  hours just to get a table then we were rushed in and out and told to scoot our chairs in  the place is way too small there are so many better places to go that need the money  i dislike trendy places that are too crowded were they treat you like an average widget to milk money from
this update is not because i went back to rosie s but to share the comment i received from my server i really think it s in poor taste she felt the need to contact me and makes me never want to give business to rosie s ever again in my review i relayed the events as they happened i m not going to sugar coat it i still think the cost of my friends drinks should not have been charged to me and it s not that my friends are unreliable dining compainions it was not their fault their drinks were not charged to them and they did nt notice the server is the one who rang up the order and made the mistake she should own up to it not blame my friends or get pissy with me it s really too bad that i do nt want to give my business to rosie s because i really do like it there and i really was nt that upset with the server just the situation i still stand by the fact the drinks wrongfully charged to me should not have been my responsiblity does nt matter if the drinks belonged to my friends i should nt have had to pay for the mistake the server made here is her comment i was your server that evening and do not appreciate that you feel servers should have to pay out of our own pockets for your friends mistakes we seperate checks to make things more convienent for you most places do not allow split checks i am sorry your friends skipped out on their portion of the tab maybe you should find more reliable dining companions as for the one beer on your tab that indeed was my mistake and if my memory serves me correctly i quickly and kindly apologized for my mistake and swiftly removed it from your tab without any friction ca nt wait to see you again soon rosie s always tries to give a good experience to it s customers
they told my friend it would only take days repair after six and phone call he decided to go to the store to see if the repairs were completed we got to the store at the sign on the door said says they close at oclock however they already had the door locked and were in the precess of closing at first they did not seem to not want help us or let him pick up his laptop they finally came to they door and he was able to pick up his laptop however as we were leaving my friend realized that there were some screws missing that held dvd driver in place this place is a joke
i will precede this lackluster review by stating the following rrb i have only been to this place once rrb i did nt get a chance to actually try the cuisine rrb i am a sympathetic person to servers as i have been one that being said i give this place one star for reasons of poor service about six months ago at around pm on a sunday afternoon we decided to eat at this place the atmosphere was warm and cozy  typical college bar with collegeaged waitresses we made sandwich selections and ordered happy hour beers the beers came the food never did and we watched other patrons come in eat and leave all the while our waitress never came by to give us an explanation or even get us another round of drinks lrb we got them ourselves from the bar rrb since my bf and i both worked in food service we are always sympathetic when we can see that a place is understaffed but after an hour of waiting we finally crossed the room to speak with our server she said i ca nt imagine it will be much longer i think the more professional approach would have been an apology and admitting to forgetting to put in our ticket which is what we gathered when we saw her speaking frantically with the cook where was the manager that day  or someone who noticed that we sat there so long without our food or any communication at all  we left money on the table for our beers and walked out i guess there is a first time for everything
it s sunday night no one felt light cooking or leaving the house sooooo we decided to order pizza being rather new to here i have never tried a pizza from the area i had a few reccomendations but none of them delivered rosatis did so i ordered a large double crust lrb as for me it s all in the crust rrb vegetarian with added veggies the total was with a tip i thought it pretty high but so were my expectations it looked really good until i took my first bite yuk on the crust it was like eating dried bread sticks perhaps overcooked or too much flower the toppings were under cooked and watery with very little cheese no one ate the actual end crust not even my dog who loves pizza they got me once but not again i could have bought large costco pizzas for that price and been in heaven live and learn
the same happened to me he said i was nt going to be charged until sept but he charged me in aug low and behold added an nsf fee when i called and asked why and said he will lose my business he said fine and hung up on me wow good customer service
let me say first that if i could give a lower rating to the way the staff of the children s museum of phoenix treated me a or lower would be appropriate unfortunately i am limited in this respect i believe it is appropriate to let a person know that you ca nt be someplace where you are expected in my place i got to where i was expected but was nt allowed to stay just the same i thought it was appropriate to let the person expecting to me to be there it does make a difference if where you are makes it very clear that they will make no more than the most minimal effort to help you do that that is a how the children s museum of phoenix staff handled my situation obviously i was mistaken when i thought i could pay cash for tickets to the event that yelpers were invited to at this place tonight i discovered when i got there that you had to buy your tickets on line ahead of time or else you were out of luck my mistake was to think the staff of this place might help me to let somebody from yelp know that i at least got there if i could nt stay talk about a group of people that were absolutely unwilling to do more than than the minimum expected of them i asked them if they could bring up a yelp page on a computer so i could explain to someone what had happened they were going do nothing of the kind the look of shock that i asked was apparent on the faces of a couple of them based on what happened and their attitude toward me i told them i would nt be back one of the women said i m sorry i told her she would only need to have said that if she d been willing to at least bring up a yelp page for me and left truthfully it takes a lot to get me to say i wo nt go back to a place in this case you might say they were terribly busy and just did nt have time for the simplest of mistakes there were enough of them standing around that i was taken from one group to another it kind of reminded me of a department store where you walk in and the sales associates are standing around talking rather taking care of customers if these people were busy i d hate to see them when they were nt maybe in a coma 
my innernerd was excited to hear about ntn buzztime and team trivia so i was stoked to come down and try this place out i was nt stoked however to learn that ntn and team trivia were two different things and i was nt stoked to wait minutes for our server to wipe down our sticky table regardless this place s parking lot was packed and the bar was buzzing with thursday night football and baseball fans drinking down pitchers and pints aside from the pool table and shuffleboard as if that alone was nt awesome enough  they have foozball too the food and service was pretty average i ordered a grilled chicken and ortega chile sandwich with monterey jack cheese it tasted pretty bland  i ate only half which if you know me means it must have been pretty blah the fries were the zesty seasoned variety  probably frozen but were still pretty good rum and cokes here were standard as well glasses were shorter than expected but neither too weak nor too strong now to the trivia it s team driven and can go kind of slow so the bigger the group at the table the more brainpower lrb but also the more likely for differing answers and arguments rrb for my friend and i who thought we were at a disadvantage  we coasted to rd place lrb out of rrb not too bad and we won a gift certificate back to hazelwoods i ll use it someday i m sure like when i m in the neighborhood or something not in a big rush ps it was grover who was on the cover of sesame street fever in case you re wondering edit  ok i m downgrading to a onestar review which is for the understaffed saturday when i went to watch bigten football and have some lunch with a gift certificate one server to about people in the entire restaurant portion to add insult to injury i paid with a gc and left a tip for an lunch and the server chased me out when i left and could nt wait any longer service was so slow and the attitude of the server toward me in the parking lot was uncalled for
they are closed now lrb
i was browsing new reviews on yelp as i am wont to do when i saw a star review for this place that reminded me that i had once tried the terrible food here about a year ago but i did not bother to write a review about it the review i read was for a different location so it is possible some of the others are better but the one in tempe is a definite no i got a pulled pork sandwich and the bread was so soggy that it was inedible not soggy in a good way from saucy goodness but like the meat and been kept hot in boiling water and they took it out and just plopped it on the bun and then squirted some bbq sauce on top my husband had ribs which tasted like they had been cooked several hours ago and then reheated in a microwave i do nt remember much else about the food but i do remember that the restaurant was so dirty and unwelcoming that we got our food togo even though we were originally planning to eat there it was just a bad vibe i know there are not a lot of options for good bbq in phx but i heartily recommend staying away from this place on a related note if anyone can tell me of a place in the valley that serves texas style barbecue then please please contact me my husband is actually pressuring me to move back to houston because he ca nt find a place here that serves beef ribs
i went to this location because of a groupon offer it s just a little stripmall joint with zero atmosphere but i planned to take the pizza togo anyway i ordered a thincrust pizza and after waiting minutes i was told that they had burned it and they had to start over reluctantly my family and i waited for another pizza this time it took minutes and although i had specifically ordered the pizza cut into slices they cut it into squares so yes a whole hour to wait for a pizza after all that the pizza was nt even very good lrb the sauce has no zing  tastes just like tomato sauce rrb bottom line is that i would never go back to this place again
ugh i ve never eaten at a federico s rodiberto s pinocchio s or any other o s before and this was the last time i ll ever do it came back late from anthem and did nt feel like cooking  this place is brand new we ve eaten at just about every surprise food establishment and against my better judgement i suggested that we give it a shot for proverbials and giggles the food was just disgusting i got a burrito and cheese enchilada combo and had to photograph it halfway through here s the pic lrb httpwwwyelpcombizphotoslhajhgomgwvbfwaqselectnhdwuhdllqmaprya rrb after bringing the meal home lrb we live a mile away rrb the burrito tortilla was almost completely cold and i m  convinced it was store bought no doubt about it leathery and foul like eating something directly out of the packet from frys after pulling it apart to remove the green peppers i noticed that there was maybe two tablespoons worth of shredded beef in there barely enough to fill a taco let alone a burrito i had three bites of the thing before discarding it and almost retching  the entire experience was like mowing down on a spandex shirt that someone had just worked out in the enchilada containment space looked like the locker room scene from the movie carrie  see photo for proof rice was okay beans were okay but pureed to the consistency of mashed potatoes barely any flavor at all the wife s mileage was the same  she flung her carne asshola burrito after a single bite and wound up pouring a bowl of cereal for dinner i tentatively bit into the kid s cheese quesadilla and almost could nt strangle it down we did nt need another mexican restaurant in phoenix and certainly not in surprise i hope this place goes down the gurgler in short order a rare single star from me
i was sitting outside of macy s and decided to walk over to this store i figured it was more of a kids store mostly for boys whoa it was a few days before halloween and it looked like a fredrick s of hollywood wanna be halloween aside  this place came off as a low class and raunchy was that really the intent of your business plan  did you feel you executed it well  who is your market demo anyway  i mean really  ugh
i do nt know how i ended up at this place i blame in on serious hungerstarved delusions that the caddy ranch may have changed for the better since my last visit the food is mediocre and kind of overpriced for the fare if you re looking to caddy it up on the cheap check out the lunch specials on the weekend or the happy hour deals during the week if you discount the tchotchke tgichilibee s atmosphere it can be a pretty decent happy hour or football destination if that s your bag the appetizer sampler is on par for bar food and a pretty good deal for the price the sliders are disappointing in terms of size and flavor but the fries they come with are pretty tasty onion rings are greaseheavy and came out cold whatevs the food really is nt the issue i have with this place it s probably a two stars for the food alone meh i ve experienced better what pushes this into the dud pile crap wait staff that does nt seem to give a flying rats ass about your table straight up grody cocktail combinations that left us feeling like we were about to go into a sugar coma the seedy vibe at the nightclub coupled with a cover to get in and the fact that the mechanical bull is like never on the night life is really a little slice of the west side in tempe as a reformed gtown resident i really need to keep away or risk slipping back into my trash person ways nyet nyet nyet three strikes and you re out caddy
food was ok the service and waiter were horrible we waited over mins for our drinks as he cleaned nearby tables that guests vacated lrb that was more important rrb he showed his attitude and was rude vig does nt care about their customers anymore as they are so busy no one from management even walks the floor in the front of the house to asks guests about their experience the vig got too big too quick and forgot about good customer service get rid of the staff with attitude wont even try the vig uptown wont waste my time
i have been here twice once for breakfast and once for lunch the service was great my first visit and awful my second both visits offered terrible food and was overpriced i had hoped for a better experience the second time around i will never return
ive never waited for more than mins at a fast food burger place i kept telling my wife that it was a good sign and that it just means that the food will be super fresh not so much the fries were prob reheated at least twice as they looked old and the burger meat was on the cold side as well ill just stick to freddys or innout
bummer  i had high hopes for this place i actually drove by once a week to check on the construction progress before they opened perfect location craft beer outside seating old red brick building atmosphere i was stoked long story short i have tried the food and beer here four times over several months and it is not good and what is with those baby diarrhea green walls and chairs talk about a year old red brick wall buzz kill service is really slow and blah it is like they hire just anybody and then turn them loose without any training i may try them again in a year or two i am really bummed this place had a lot of potential
whenever i visit a breakfast place i begin by ordering an entree which is pretty basic to the menu i visited this good egg location twice both times i ordered the same thing poached eggs bacon toast potatoes both times i was really disappointed first of all the eggs were not poached they were nearly hardboiled no runny beautiful yolk with which to dip my toast someone was nt watching the pot bacon was good but a bit on the salty side toast was a little on the cold side and already buttered with something the potatoes looked like the diced frozen type which were just warmed up the second time i did say something to the waitress lrb as well as the cashier rrb who although i was nearly finished with my meal offered to have the eggs cooked again she was nice so i would actually add a star for the nice service last the price a basic breakfast with coffee was over  come on i ll never return to his restaurant for breakfast especially when i can go to the orange table which is also dogfriendly people friendly and uses top of the line locally grown ingredients a basic twoegg breakfast is and they know how to poach an egg the ot also provides homemade breads and other great breakfast items httpwwworangetablenetbreakfastmenu breakfast should give you pleasure and energy for the day not a bellyache
friday night we went to a business dinner as a part of a party of while the ambiance was fantastically amazing the dinner was amazingly disappointing in every other way our bill totalled and was paid for on our host s expense account so no personal money was wasted but it still really bothered me how horrible and disgraceful both the service and the food were appetizers were not served and when we remind our waiter richard he had the nerve to charge us for the one we still wanted the food was really inconsistent  our host did not like his cauliflower soup or snapper desert orders were taken in bits and pieces just to name a few of the problems it makes no sense how a seemingly fine fine fine restaurant can have such poor service and do nothing in the end for its guests the whole experience was really mindbending since the potential was tremendous and the result so poor
oh man where do i start  this had to be the worst dining experience of my life we show up and it s a minute wait for two okay that s normal but wait you have to stand outside and it was degrees today they had a canopy set up gee thanks but how about a glass of water while i wait  not here i m so glad i had a little bit of iced tea left in my cup from aj s this morning so we get seated  get this outside under an enclosed wooden canopy who does that to their patrons in phoenix in the summer  they had misters but they were nowhere near us they had a fan mounted on the patio roof but it blew right over the top of us and did no good i think they sell portable evaporative coolers at home depot that would have been nice so i m looking at the menu and trying to decide what i want to eat when i see the waitress bring out an order to a table near us i m a bacon freak and i love it extra crispy the order she brought out had bacon and it was cooked to perfection things were starting to look up when she set the small plate down in front of the little girl i did nt think anything of it it was an adequate portion for a nine year old we ll return to this in a moment so the waitress takes our order and i excuse myself to use the washroom and wash my hands so i ask where the washroom is thinking it s inside i was politely told it was located in the back as in go outside around the back and there you ll see them as i walk around the corner i suddenly feel as if i m entering a washroom at a grungy service station the washrooms were nt clean were nt air conditioned and the urinal did nt flush can you see where this is going  so back to my seat our order arrives and guess what it s the same size as what i had earlier thought was a kid s portion i m so glad it was hot and i was nt super hungry so how was the food  well the eggs were runny the hash browns were completely overdone on the outside but still raw on the inside and the bacon well let s just say that a couple of bandaids and that pig would be out wallerin around in the mud again i ll admit i should have done a little research on my part before eating here but i seriously doubt i ll go back at least denny s is consistent and has clean bathrooms i ll give the place one star because at least they had two cool photos of marilyn monroe in the men s room
leonard leonard leonard is there really even a leonard that works there  leonard goes to work and then takes an hour break i called staples to follow up on a print order and he told me he was going to have to call me back because it was time for his break i then went to the store and ole leonard was too busy on his cell phone to help me the only upside to this place is the nice female that works in the copyprint center
i was really looking forward to going but i m very disappointed the ingredient quality especially the meat seems very poor the service is friendly but the food is bland the the serving size is nt a great value as much as i am not a fan of big chains i would go to chipotle before taco del mar any day there are much better options for mexican
last visit was saturday december for dinner had a gift card so the family and i did dinner and a movie upon entering the restaurant we were blinded by a lamp aimed directly at the door from the hostess station apparently the overhead lights in the lobby were out as we were lead to our table i noticed food and debris on the floor we were seated next to the utensil folding station even though there were plenty of other tables available to accommodate the four of us i had to wait for the hostess to move the broom and dust pan out of the way so i could take a seat she dropped all four of our rolled up silver wear on the floor while trying to move the broom she then put those on our table rather than reach over to the utensil folding table and get fresh ones our order took minutes to finally reach our table my vegetables were overlooked as was my steak my daughter s steak was overlooked as well my husband s burger was overlooked and dry we ordered four desert shooters my daughter s desert glass was broken almost in half how could they not notice that we will not be back there again
absolute garbage food is nt there at all cold old and over saturated with bell peppers service is nonexistent by both servers and management this place really gives the scottsdale quarter and the city of scottsdale a bad name just let it go already and let another restaurant take over
what an unfortunate dining experience instead of serving with tinfoil the food should be served with a strainer lrb or wet vac shamwow an entire roll of bounty rrb i felt like i was eating wet slop i went with friends all had the same experience soggy wet crap the sweet pork has more sugar than a pack of mt dew how does this place have stars  how can anyone say its even remotely comparable to chipotle 
it takes very little in a burrito to satisfy me mainly it s fresh ingredients in a pinch i can even enjoy taco bell i threw my veggie burrito away uneaten it was just bad stale tasteless and soggy finally decided on cpk for my second dinner but burger king would have still been way better than blue burrito grill
i kept giving this place a chance to prove itself since the reviews i read on yelp tend to be positive last night i gave up pricey italian food with quality lower than what i usually get at other italian restaurants the linguine with clams has no sweetness of seafood but saltiness the grits of sand in the dish made chewing a noisy and lousy experience when i talked to the waitress casually about it she was immediately defensive instead of acknowledging the problem she simply told me its inevitable she also brought us the check without offering desert menu i will never visit again
a bad choice for a motel in phoenix if your plans include sleep i blundered into it by reserving on line and trying to save a few bucks  bad mistake the place is just north of the west end of the sky harbor airport and about feet from an amtrak  freight railroad crossing in an industrial area a oneonone girlie place is across the street and there is an adult toy store nearby classy neighborhood the roar of the planes and the ringing of the railroad crossing penetrates the rooms like there are no walls and the trains themselves always blow their whistles  about a hundred times  as they approach the crossing  even in the middle of the night the freight trains are about a hundred cars long there are absolutely no amenities here but the price is still pretty high  about fifty bucks  you can go to the la quinta and live in absolute luxury for another twenty bucks  it will be worth it the bedspreads are so garishly colored with the motel logo that the decor alone will keep you awake little tiny towels in a little tiny bathroom no chairs to sit in to watch tv the staff is nice though and they have free lrb rrb coffee in the office in the morning and  they have an allnight security to guard to keep the derelicts from stealing the stuff out of your car there is a pool do not go here repeat  do not go here
i live right by amore so when they opened up i decided to give them a try the first time we ordered from amore we got a pizza it was mediocre what really struck me was the service the young man at the register was outside talking to his friends and texting when i got there it took him at least two minutes to come back inside and help me and when he finally did he was rude the second time i went in i ordered pizza and wings when i got there once again i had to wait for the person working the register to stop chatting on his phone to serve me my pizza was ready but they had nt even started my wings i sat and watched them make my wings i almost told them to just forget it because they wings looked horrible they were pale and they used an already used bowl to coat them in buffalo sauce i literally live minutes and when i got home my pizza was cold i was also concerned the wings were undercooked so i cut one open first to check i was right they were completely raw on the inside i had to put them in the oven for at least another minutes and they were still so greasy and terrible i ended up picking off all the chicken meat and feeding it to the dogs i must be a glutton for punishment because i tried them a third time and once again had a terrible experience i did nt have to wait at the register and this time the cashier was actually friendly my husband and i ordered a pizza salad and garlic bread when i got home i realized i had never gotten the salad i was back there less than minutes of leaving and i told him he had forgotten to give me my salad he basically accused me of trying to get a free salad off of him he tried to tell me i had never ordered a salad at first i thought he was kidding but then i realized he was serious we had ordered online so i told him just to check their online order log he told me that was nt possible then i told him to just look at my receipt it should be at the top of their garbage can since i watched him throw it away he glanced in the garbage bin and told me it was nt there i had my credit card receipt and i showed it to him i asked him how it could possibly be that much if i had nt ordered a pizza bread and salad since the salad was i had to sit there arguing with him for almost minutes before he d give me my salad if you want to avoid bad food and terrible service then avoid this place at all costs if you re in the area and really have a pizza craving go to bashas they sell whole pizzas and pizza by the slice and it s actually very good and you ll receive five star  service
the one star is for booze only my girlfriends and i came here for dinner on a friday night before hitting the town for my bachelorette party we waited at the bar for the rest of our party to arrive and i was happy with the drink options once our party had all arrived we moved to a table here s where things get lame first one of my good friends asks our server about some wine and he just shrugs and says he does nt drink wine but that they have a wine guy aka a sommelier which he could nt pronounce but that he was at they re other restaurant next when i order i ask which seafood dish is best and he told me the happy family it s a mix of shrimp calamari chicken and scallops with veggies in a brown sauce which sounded pretty good to me looking back i think he only suggested it because it was one of the more pricier options at i love veggies and it was mostly snap peas with some broccoli mixed in so i grab a snap pea and immediately want to spit it out it tasted like soap lrb plus the sauce was nt brown at all it was kinda clear not much flavor at all except for the soapy flavor lrb i did nt eat much but took the rest home for left overs later that night and for the rest of the weekend i had some weird stomach issues but nothing too serious and chalked it up to the drinking from the same night on monday night i heated up my leftovers and only took or bites because it tasted so horrible and immediately made my stomach hurt the next morning i woke up to the worst case of food poisoning i ve ever had i wo nt give you all the gross details but i was so sick i could nt even stand to take a shower i read another review just now with someone else getting sick from seafood so do not order seafood from this place
i m not going to take the time to rewrite the same story as bri d but i will add this  if you ca nt manage to get food in front of someone minutes after they order it you should not be in the restaurant business it is breakfast it should take minutes tops i could have waited for a table at the good egg been seated and served in less time than it took for me to finally give up on this craptastic joke of a cafe no thanks
wow i just ordered dinner for myself and my two little kids the guy was an hour late and i tried to call several times and got the busy signal each time when i told the delivery guy i did nt want it anymore because i had already made a different dinner for my kids he said ok that s fine unbelievable will never order from here again
hate to be the sour apple amongst all these glowing reviews but when you have a customer who ca nt eat something you serve them and they tell you that after you ask how your lunch was lrb plate almost untouched btw rrb and you do nt offer to do something about it what can you say  i ordered pad thai and after i tasted it i was unable to eat it as it was so sickening sweet that i thought i was going to go into sugar shock now the review that i did just before this one was also about pad thai that was a bit too sweet i m not sure if asianthai restaurants in this area think that arizonians prefer their pad thai sweeter than where i m originally from lrb honestly i have eaten a lot of pad thai rrb or if it s just that my tastes have changed or just what the main difference is that the last place the pad thai was just a little too sweet and did nt taste like the cook used  bottle of clear karo syrup in the making of the meal also the last place had a fellow who was unable to tolerate the spiciness of his lunch and when the server there saw he was nt eating it immediately inquired and substituted another entree my server here at tum nak thai asked if everything was alright lrb full plate of food pushedaway from me rrb and when i told him i could nt eat is he asked me if i wanted a takehome container and recommended the  lunch special the next time next time  sorry this type of lack of concern is inexcusable no thanks i endedup going to subway to get something to fill my stomach  
made an appointment at the portrait studio for pm it is now pm and i am still waiting they close at and there is someone after me the consultant is still talking through photo choices with the family who was here before when i arrived i came to take maternity photos and i feel like leaving but this is really the only chance i have to get them done so i am trying to be patient we will see what happens  so minutes after my appointment time i am still waiting i walked out
tried to overcharge me for a double cheeseburger and then when i tried to explain to the manager what happened they seemed to not have a clue how to fix lrb i had to explain it to them about times for them to understand and then i pretty much had to spell out what they should do to make it right rrb the place doesnt look very clean and i would consider this to be below the standards for most burger kings
i ca nt imagine worse service than i received at this restaurant we visited for a sunday brunch arriving around am despite a handful of open tables we were told to wait lrb minutes rrb for a table minutes later we were seated it s a restaurant sometimes you need to wait this was a bit annoying but hey  it happens apparently the table we were seated at was not a part of this restaurant we were ignored by several servers after about minutes the bartender came over apologized for us not having been served and went to go find our server we never saw her again minutes later we complained to the host lrb who did nt seem to have any idea where he was rrb and were informed that one of the servers who had been ignoring us lrb he actually sat down for another conversation at another table rrb was actually our server he had literally walked past our drinkless table a dozen times no one was apologetic for this episode i d expect something comped or at least the appearance of a manager lrb and an apology rrb for this episode but what we got was complete indifference we left angry i saw no evidence of any interest in customer service here i would not return under any circumstances the place was somewhat busy at the time of our visit but not enough to excuse this
if i can give this shity experience a big fat zero i would i do nt see why people drive hours and hours away from their homes to go sit in dirty ass water the experience was super extremely terrible for me i got so burnt after plastering on so much sun tan lotion then i hit a rock in the middle of the dirty filthy water and almost drowned from the current that kept pushing me and your not sure if it s shallow and it s really ft deep luckily i know how to swim and the few people who actually helped me thank god i honestly do nt know how people can mix alchol sun and a crazy ass river then the tube gets crazy hot from sitting in the sun and you burn the hell out of your arms on the plastic then when your getting near the little currents it gets mega shallow then your ass just rubs on a bunch of rocks and your back and ass get bumped and scratched how could people seriously enjoy that then there is no supervision from anyone from salt river tubing and recreation when people do drowned who do nt know how to swim this is seriously a dangerous experience and the horses who run wildly free and take craps in the water so gross then when exiting it was so hard it says  to exit but its so hard cause its near a current where it just keeps dragging you and pushing you in and it s very shallow so when you do jump off your legs get hurt and scratched this was seriously was a waste of money and scary experience for me i freakin almost died here is this place even legit cause you can only pay cash of  no taxes  does the state really even know about this place  i would never come back here again
ultimate electronics  ultimate  their supposed aim is to  deliver the world s best customer service by providing the ultimate experience hmm ultimate experience hmm yes this is going to be ugly true they have tvs stacked end to end true they will match the prices and heck maybe even beat it i was in there to buy a inch tv and well the sales pitch was nice smooth no problems what gives then  it wasnt delivered on time ok no biggie shit happens but when i called to ask about the delay the sales manager was rude and condescending a hr delay was no big deal in spite of having made it amply clear that we had other things to do after that really ticked me off and how the store manager was cocky and arrogant and for having dropped a lot of money on a tv in the given economy i think i could have been treated with a little not a lot a little bit of respect not for anything else but because i would be back to make more purchases instead now i will never go back not to this store and ask everyone else not to go there as well
this is a place you have to seat yourself there was no talking involved other than the waiter asking us what we want to order the guy who drop off the food just put it down and left we had to figure out which one was which no water refills flies visited our table often lrb not sure if this is normal for the phoenix area because the door was open rrb we ordered pho my friend liked it but i did nt because the soup tasted sweeter than i usual have it the place seems pretty popular there were people coming in and out when paying you have to walk up to the counter yourself and pay there was no service to speak of
my husband and i really wanted to check out this office because it is the closest to us we had no problem making the appointment for doctor interview at am to meet the doctor and promptly showed up at the time of the appointment just to find out that the doctor was not there in a brief conversation where we stated that we are going to wait until doctor shows up we were told that we ca nt meet with doctor regardless of the appointment before we could even react office manager marry summers informed us that we can not talked with other doctors and what we were told is not true i have to emphasize that mary summers was not nice apologetic and empathetic about our situation at all she just wanted us out of the office i know that everybody has a bad morning but she was letting it shine mary continued with this  you were informed wrong and what i am telling you is how it is  you do nt need anybody s name but mine  other people choose the doctor by reading the bio online  this is my office policy on and on and on mary continued to cut us and see us on the way out maybe those doctors in the office are nice but why would i bother going through this office representation when even the doctor were not there for their appointment and i would not see them even if i would wait to all of you that still wish to try this office i really wish you good luck
first let me say that anyone giving this place more than or stars are either family members or friend of the owners i lived in illinois and have been to indiana numerous times and never have i had this bad of food i went here for breakfast and order basic eggs sausage biscuits and gravy hash browns the biscuits were tiny gravy is terrible sausage and eggs were like i could have cooked at home this place is comparable to places like denys and waffle house if you like those places go to there and not here
updated  i decided to give this restaurant one last chance no such luck i went there with two friends before we even got there i told them about the problems i had with this location but they talked me into giving it another chance thinking i was over reacting we left minutes after walking in the beginning the water we slipped in coming through the door the argument with the cashier over my friends thick german accent and hearing have the little bitch at the counter call my friend a nazi under her breathe while we left lrb which started another argument rrb it was clear this is my last time coming here save your money go to the location on black canyon near metrocenter original review i hate hate hate hate this fuddruckers i have nt been back to this one for a good while first off to the management now more than ever companies should be striving to please their paying customers if this is true then why does the manager keep hiring the same type of employees what type you wonder  the same snot nosed teenagers who think they can get rewarded without doing even a marginal job since i first came to this fudd i ve had problems with the staff and my food i actually now drive to the fudd that s near metrocenter it s more gas but it s worth it at least i walk into that location and have a clean bathroom with friendly staff to lgbt community and other persons if you are or look like you re gay or transgendered steer clear of this restaurant when i first came out i carried a messenger bag no flamboyant shirts or leggings like i wear now i walked with plain clothes with my bag instantly had problems not to mention all the violations this place has had once a long long time ago i walked into the bathroom and someone had taken a dump on the floor not in the stall in front of the sinks what s worse is that it took an hour for them to clean it up i think i ve said my peace
i do nt get it i do nt get it at all the hype over this place leaves me scratching my head the first time i went here i thought the kids who worked there were super rude and the sandwich was no better than a subway i decided to give this place a second try today my mistake the sandwich had zero taste the bread was super dry and the kid at the front was more interested in drinking his soda and going on break than waiting on me i would nt waste a dime or another minute on this place
i went in here to get my car fixed after it was running with only half the pistons and they couldnt find out what was wrong with it took it to a friend who worked on it for an hour and found three things that were contributing to the problem after handing my car back to me i found out they hadnt even put the intake back on the car i dont think they were really interested in finding out what was wrong with my car to begin with will not be returning unless in dire straits
first time ever i have taken the time to write a review the owner lrb wife rrb is extremely rude we spend a good to thousand dollars a year there for many years they ruined many items of clothes lrb which would never take responsibility for rrb but this last time was a dress that i just bought she waited so long to tell me that now i can not replace it because it is sold out she said she would eat half and i would have to eat half and basically threw it at me with a look of disgust they delivered my clothes the next day and charged my card so she did nt even eat the half that was promised do not do buisness with these people
ra is to sushi what date rape is to romance
no great surprise here but this place has been closed for several months now and the space is available for lease
cockroaches in the salsa and serving the food every time i ve been here i wish i had gone else where
i just reviewed us airways lrb lax squad rrb but when checking in upon landing in phoenix airport after another absolute horrible experience from cancun to phoenix this story needed to be told prior to departing from out hotel to cancun airport on december to catch lrb flight rrb i received an email from us airways advising us that our flight that was scheduled to depart at was now changed to i figured no big deal minutes  we will still be able to make our connecting flight from arizona to lax upon arriving at cancun airport the mexican staff was fast efficient professional and knowledgeable they even apologized several times from our flight being delayed our bags were taken our passports were checked and we were on our way to our flight in no time flat once again us airways does not deem going from mexico to usa as an international flight so you are required to pay the service fee per bag do you guys remember the reason the bag fee came about  it was because of increased gas prices several years ago and now the airlines look at this as another way to separate you from your money just like a stripper or a waitress at hooters upon arriving at our terminal and dealing with the american staff manning the checkin counter just adjacent to our gate was another story there was person to review all passengers flights documents customs forms  passports this caused an absolute quagmire of a line with no direction from the staff this line and the lack of staff caused the flight that was due to depart at pm to depart at pm that does not seem like that big of a deal but when you add into the mix that basically everyone on the flight was connecting to another flight it is a big deal add in that when you land in phoenix you have to go to get your passport checked go to baggage claim retrieve your bag go through customs recheck your bag  then go through the tsa screening again lrb ie shoes off the whole yards rrb every minute counts our flight takes off as stated above at pm once again for the hour  minute flight no flight entertainment as well as the inflight service once again being horrible the st class flight attendant was hitting on passenger the entire flight the rest of the flight attendants onboard did their best to avoid eye contact which meant they would walk past you even if you had your hand raised in the air trying to get their attention what is your biggest fear during a flight besides it crashing or blowing up  i would rank my top fear as smelling  smoke or the smell of something  burning my girlfriend quietly whispered to me  do you smell something burning  shortly afterwards another passenger said the same thing and asked the flight attendant if they smelled something burning the flight attendant instead of actually investigating said  no and continued on we arrived in phoenix safely but really when more than person is saying they smell something and you basically ignore it  on a plane  really  we arrived in phoenix late did the passport check baggage retrieval customs recheck bags tsa security and sprinted from terminal c to terminal a which by airport standards is a pretty longggggggg way we arrived and found out that that flight was holding their doors for everyone to make it from the delayed cancun flight to the connecting los angeles flight i will say that the staff onboard this flight was nice  helpful but overall i wish i could give this airline negative stars this airline has forever lost me as a customer and anyone of my friends or family that will listen to the overall experience we had with us airways never again i forgot to mention when we landed in phoenix the plane sounded like a year old rollercoaster everything shook and made noise nothing about it was smooth the overhead compartment doors rattled and the look on the faces of people sitting around me were that of concern this airline is a joke
i ll keep this short  do not sign up for sprint service while living in phoenix az they do not plan on rolling out g lte in the phoenix metro area until late at the very earliest g is not currently available g service is spotty and slow calls drop constantly dead zones everywhere there is nothing you can do as a customer to get out of your contract after the initial return period either i had att for nearly ten years before switching to sprint and i made the switch to save a few bucks a month huge mistake see recent service comparisons in phoenix here httpwwwrootmetricscomcomparecarriersphoenixphoenixoctober httpwwwpcmagcomarticleasp once again stay away from sprint in phoenix
i chose this place for somewhere different and the reviews were mixed the website s view of the inside of the bar is taken from a wide angle lens and it was smaller than i expected but i liked the eclectic feel the music was good but the drinks were horrible lrb watered down and tasteless rrb the saki was watered down too we just went there for appetizers and drinks and the food was less than average like supermarket sushi at trader joes bland quite a few guys with guys so if you are a single lady or a married one who s husband got hit on like me then pass this place up the toilet was the only nice thing about this place
like a lonely sailor in subic bay my computer got quite a virus i can even put into words what a painful experience i had with the geek squad at this location the details would only be a long rambling diatribe i will say that the only place i have ever been spoken down to more was in the back hills of georgia
very disappointed all they want is new stuff and for you to drop it off hello they are bypassing some good used stuff and people contact them because they pick items up that many people are unable to drop off wo nt contact them again
it takes a lot for me to write a one star review but this place was incredibly disappointing i met up with two girl friends for lunch on a perfect saturday afternoon we had nt tried garage yet but had been excited to do so as we frequent the area often the atmosphere was great we were really looking forward to our experience and our meal unfortunately we were severely disappointed our server was attentive and nice but did nt followup the way i expected or hoped i ordered the caprese mozzarella salad lrb one of my favorite options on many a menu rrb and was shocked when my plate came full of tomatoes with two skimpy pieces of mozzarella and a tiny piece of basil lrb about as big as my thumb rrb there was no way that i was interested in paying for a plate of tomatoes i hate complaining at restaurants lrb being a past server rrb so i kindly asked ours for some extra mozzarella and basil my frustration increased when i saw that i was charged another for the extra two pieces of cheese my friend s meal was also a disappointment she ordered the flat bread special of the day and it was drenched in grease which made it very difficult to eat let alone enjoy she was only able to finish half of her meal i expected our server to at least ask if she was unhappy with her food but she just took the plate and walked away as great as this new joint seemed i will most likely not be returning it s a shame because the place really looked like it had potential unfortunately the food was overpriced poorly executed and lacking quality and flavor sorry garage you re going to need to seriously up your game to earn me as a customer
the worst worst worst place in town i will never go back there again the dryers did nt work leaving my clothes sopping wet and the extremely rude women working there refused to refund my money the place was filthy dirty and crowded and there were not enough laundry carts moreover the women working there had a horrible attitude toward the customers there s hardly ever any parking spaces available and homeless bums drug addicts and drunks hang out in front bothering customers for spare change don t waste your time with these people the worst
i went to this petco a few times and was a bit appalled at their rodents section to be perfectly honest granted it was nt as bad as it could have been but in my opinion it was unacceptable for one thing there was six or seven rats packed in one cage that was what x x  do nt quote me on that  i m not  sure but regardless of the details it was way too small for the number of rats that were in it they were nt unhealthy  they did nt look very sick but they definitely did nt look particularly healthy either the guinea pigs were what really shocked me though if you know anything about guinea pigs you ll know they need a lot of space  even just for one this cage was the same size as the rat s cage lrb they all were rrb they barely had enough to room to walk much less exercise or popcorn lrb which my guinea pigs do often rrb there were two guinea pigs packed in that thing when it was way way too small for one baby guinea pig it also did nt look that clean  all the cages in my opinion were grungy the whole place felt grungy and grimy and they obviously were nt cleaning the cages everyday which they should be doing it would be more unfair to the animals to do anything but at least a small cleaning each day the prices are indeed pretty good or at least better than the prices at the petsmart i usually go to so there s one point for petco at last the employees are they nice and cheerful  yes that is until you politely point out that the guinea pig cage is way too small for them to be healthy and happy lrb i was trying my hardest to be polite although i could have come across as rude rrb they lrb or the one i talked to rrb immediately turn defensive telling you it s very temporary and we take them out every night lrb which i do nt believe but maybe a petco employee can correct me on that  rrb and make a face at you not once telling you they ll tell their manager lrb even if they wo nt rrb or you may be right like a good employee would want your customers to come back  here s a good tip do nt tell them they re wrong about something and rudely correct them obviously trying to rush them out humor them even if they are wrong about something overall i would recommend not shopping here they do nt take good care of their pets and their employees are rude if you care about the animals when they plainly do nt good prices  they do nt make up for that i apologize if i made this too long and thank you if you read all of this regardless of whether or not you agree with me
if you really are on a tight budget really i wish i would have paid more per night then to come here the pool was closed fitness rooms ac did nt work and pretty much the ac in our room did nt work very well we had to run it nonstop i am very disappointed at this place oh and the continental breakfast fruit was rotten the floors where filthy and i do nt think they ever wiped anything down ever the employees are very nice but you would think they would notice the filth  its one thing to have an old building but dayum you can clean right 
we walked into this taco shop late one friday night after a party hoping to soak up the alcohol with some cheap mexican food bad choice i got one ground beef taco and one carne asada taco and both were terrible the ground beef taco shell was so hard i basically had to rip it apart with my teeth i ended up leaving the top of the shell and only eating the meat the carne asada taco had a soft corn tortilla so it did nt have the same problem instead it completely fell apart i ended up eating it with a fork even though the meat was really bland lrb cmon i was starved rrb husband got three rolled tacos which were direct quote meh they taste like taquitos i m thinking we wo nt be heading back there any time soon
the single star is for the only decent item on menu the cheese crisp the food was gross i had chicken enchiladas my husband had a steak after he was told his first two choices were unavailable service was fine
as someone who was a big fan of this place for years in california i have to say that for many reasons this would be the your worst choice for breakfast in scottsdale our previous visits have always been filled with ridiculous waits for ok food and a very dirty table this past weekend we had the added bonus of a bitchy hostessmanager that actually mouthed off to one of our party and was completely rude and unreasonable please do not give your money to this establishment lrb besides they only take cash rrb
 i give it four thumbs down this place is an enigma to me for some reason people rave about this joint i ve been here twice and felt like i was being shafted when i ended up paying money for the garbage they served me at first glance the place looks promising sporting your basic mexican menu with all the classic combinations however upon ordering an enchilada flauta or taco this joint nose dives bland is the best way to describe this place the salsa is laughable and the hot salsa is nt even one alarm they do nt offer a real bar or much beer so try their margarita thing for a huge disappointment i ca nt understand why this place has nt gone belly up but i guess that s why i ca nt understand folks promoting the joint either fili b s is better than this no lies anyone giving this place stars should be grounded from yelp for a month because there is no way that this place deserves it
okay i am not sure what has possessed me to return to this place after my first experience there the only thing that i can think of is that the passage of time dulled my senses and made me forget about my prior experiences but i have written myself a note reminding myself to avoid this place in the future this restaurant has survived on the hype of being one of the only nice places downtown but luckily that has changed i went there for dinner one night and because i did not feel like ordering a salad i decided to order a sandwich the only thing that i can think of is that upon hearing my order the chef immediately ran down to the nearest vending machine and got a roast beef sandwich out of that vending machine took the sandwich out of the plastic wrap and plopped it down on the plate and actually had the gonads to serve it as if they made it it was by far the worst meal i have had in some time and is a constant reminder why i will not eat there again unless my alzheimers kicks in if you have to go there my recommendation is that you eat before hand and simply order a martini ikkide ccccccc
very disappointed i had my usual dirty martini but a friend wanted just a soda since she was driving do you know what they charged for a soda and it was in the smallest glass come on with dui laws that we have here in scottsdale and the economy crisis that we are in for a soda is a bit much when it is cheaper at target to get a case lrb rrb i am not cheap by any stretch but i think it is a bit absurd to over inflate the price of a soda do nt go to stone rose if you are looking for a drink deal
prices were way to high i was in there about two week ago to show my friend what i thought was going to be a cool candy store but after what i saw i m never going back it was a little busy when i went in but after seeing three kids lick the scooper and put them in the candy jar and lick them again i could nt stay there another second
despite my monthly use of frontline plus my dog came home covered in tiny ticks after being here for days the facilities did not appear the cleanest and now i m suffering from taking my dog there when i called to inform them of this they told me i must not have used frontline and that no other dogs had ticks however they also did not tell me my dog had ticks i definitely would not recommend this facility please save your dog and take himher somewhere else in response to their response lrb on kudzu which could nt fit my whole response rrb i never asked for money back i asked for advice on getting the ticks off my dog maybe you should nt assume and try to listen to what i was saying i m concerned about my dog as i have a medical degree and know about lyme disease these are small ticks which are more likely to transmit lyme disease nothing like a trip to the vet after work tomorrow to make for a great start to the week also here s some information from the frontline website frontline plus offers longlasting flea and tick control killing up to  of fleas on your pet within hours and up to  of ticks on your pet within hours best of all research confirms that frontline products work for an entire month to help keep your pet fleafree notice it says kills in hours lrb probably more than of the ticks were dead but some where still alive but as they kindly pointed out it has been hours rrb and it says keeps them flea free not tick free maybe i just have a doctorate degree but i can read please do not try to insult me  i just do nt want other people to spend hours upon hours getting ticks off their dogs after your facility and as far as it taking me hours to notice  some people work and when you get home from trips your first reaction might not be to check your hairy dog for ticks they were hidden in his coat  i found it after work today when giving him a nice neck scratch only to find many many more and obviously this was not the first time this happened as you do require proof of flea treatment which i did provide and used two weeks ago lrb but as you can see it s not fullproof rrb in addition you mention the amount of ticks you have on your grounds and the treatments you have to do maybe i m just reading into this too much and fyi my condo is clean there has never been a dog in here at least since it was remodeled  the previous tenant is my landlord but yet again assume what you want but for readers understand how dishonest they are being if suddenly there are lots of good reviews just think who is probably doing that the owners probably 
let me start this off with saying this is more about the atrocious service and how downhill this place has gone about a year ago i had some clients or are restaurant venture capitalist back in nyc in town and we stopped by cd for drinks and a casual dinner great time they loved it so we went back last saturday got there drinks at the bar went perfect then we were sat were all went downhill our waitress was this shorter blonder girl with longer hair wish i had gotten her name to call her out took her minutes to get us water and drinks blamed it on the bartenders being all new which is a lie because the bartenders had taken excellent care of us minutes earlier spilt two of the cocktails all over us then proceeded to tell us they ran out of pretzels but if we wanted she could have them make it minutes after our order was placed did you run out of them or forgot to put it in  instead of a beef barely soup she brought a beef stroganav mind you she wrote this order down on paper twice because she said she lost the pad the first time burger with no cheese  arrived with cheese then comes the bill at which point she tells us that we should nt worry she did nt charge us for the pretzels she never brought or the drinks she spilt on us then she left us with more words of wisdom you should all come back on a monday and tuesday when it s slow and empty saturdays are too busy and we should expect everything to get screwed up are you kidding me  i think they ve started employing either complete trashy idiots or people who are drunk or high while on the job
if only i could rate it lower if you have nt eaten mexican food you might like this place green sauce was burnt salsa was boring carne asada tasted like italian food sad i miss good mexican food lrb
what a horrible experience i placed a reservation on thursday for the next day and when i showed up on friday night the restaurant was closed did they not know the restaurant will be closed the next day when i placed my reservation  and if they did nt was it too hard to give me a phone call  i am not setting my foot there again
after a min wait outside friday pm entered the restaurant ordered pm orders came out way past pm the manager was going around apologizing for delays we could nt leave till pm our server chad was not paying attention and making mistakes that could be avoided he brought out a french onion soup instead of clam chowder after the  min wait we ate the portions were small but the quality was above average we gave a coupon to chad chad seperate checks or all together  us seperate checks please chad together got it us we d like to split the check between parties please he processed our bill and came back the coupon was not applied so we flagged him down again chad how was everything guys  food come out in a timely manner  lrb dead silence rrb well you re one of the lucky ones he said no no and no just because we were nt more vocal like the other customers does nt mean we were one of the lucky ones then he came back the coupon was applied but he had forgotten of our credit cards he looked through his apron smock thingy and pulled out the other two credit cards wow that looks bad does nt it  he said no comment dead silence he came back with the receipts and one pen which did nt work at all at this point we decided to procure another pen on our own and just sign and tip and get out of there i had a bad experience and it was rather disappointing would not go back for a long time
a few months ago i wrote a very positive review of this place starting about in september however something very odd and unpleasant happened to cheuvront the lunch service became slow to the point where i thought i d been forgotten worse the food started to change in unpleasant ways gone were the good ingredients and subtle flavorings suddenly everything was layered on in huge blobs and weighted down with unnecessary spices specifically i m talking about the lunch pizzas i had for lunch at cheuvront so many times before last time i went a few weeks ago i suddenly noticed that they used nearly four times the cheese necessary today there was four times the cheese at least two or three times the sauce along with chunks of nearly raw garlic worse the cheese on my pizza was cool and congealed showing that it had been sitting around for a while before the wait staff deigned to bring it to me i was embarrassed to have suggested to a colleague that we eat at cheuvront today i do nt know what happened to this restaurant but at least the lunch service is a total loss
i ve never felt as unwelcome in a restaurant as i did last night at gallo blanco my friend dixon and i were participants in a mass bike ride through town called critical mass the organizer has an arrangement with the clarendon hotel which is the location for gallo blanco as far as we knew it was mutually understood that the cyclists were welcome to come by after the ride grab a drink and use the pool from the moment we walked in the gm was all over the two of us i should make it clear that neither of us have anything to do with organizing the event it was almost as if he thought we were trying to pull one over on him when we repeatedly told him we were not organizers and thought everything was agreed upon in advance honestly i m not sure what difference it makes anyway as we were just like any other patron dressed normally and wanted to get a drink from the bar our mode of transportation should not have made any difference at all he said this is my restaurant to us as if we were not wanted there the gm could sense my annoyance even though he was interrogating dixon he looked over and offered to buy us a drink when this all gets sorted out he then pointed us over to the corner and told us to just wait over here i can understand not wanting a chaotic scene in a dining room but this was insulting the gm never returned to tell us he had spoken to our leader after a few minutes of standing around in the corner we went to the bar to order drinks while ordering the gm walked up but said nothing he did not make good on his promise to buy a drink for our troubles which was nt really surprising i wish i had even one thing nice to say about this venue because i m sure under different circumstances it would have been a good experience i doubt i will be driving or biking to gallo blanco any time in the future
will never stay at this hotel again the first time i stayed here was fine  i had a two room suite with one for the bedroombathroom separate from the living roomkitchen when i arrived this time on monday night to check in i asked if my room had a king bed and was told yes i forgot to ask for confirmation that the room also had a bathtub so after i got up to my room and found the shower only in the room i had to go back downstairs i asked for another room and was told the hotel only had rooms with both a king and bath tub he found me another room and i went upstairs it was not separated like the room i previously had  it was all open like one big great room the temperature in the room was about degrees and after i checked the thermostat it was set at so i went back down to the lobby again and asked for another room since the air conditioning was not working he then said he would give me a two bedroom suite upgrade i thanked him and went to the room when i walked into one of the bedrooms the entire room smelled like urine and the lamp shade was broken and hanging off the lamp i went in the bathroom and took the shower curtain down  i stuffed it in a laundry bag and took both the shower curtain and lamp shade to the front desk when i went back to the room it no longer smelled like urine  recommend asking housekeeping change your shower curtain immediately  they never change them so you will have to ask so that you do nt have to smell urine  the hotel never brought a new lamp shade we found two different kinds of bugs in the room the blanket smelled like old cheap perfume so clearly had not been washed i pulled the comforter out of the comforter cover and it smelled like vomit  saw the stains so that got thrown in a corner the free food for breakfast and dinner is a nice perk the pool and jacuzzi are fine plus the free wifi is nice my daughter left her phone charger in the room and i called to ask if it was turned in two days later and the hotel still has not called us to let us know if they have it edward is very pleasant to work with and tried very hard to accommodate all of the mistakes from housekeeping  the last night he offered to make one night or my bottles of water and snacks complimentary but i will not stay at this hotel again it was probably fine the first couple years it was open but now it is dirty and shabby but mostly just dirty
they deserve zero stars unfortunately that s not an option i ve never seen a business that provides such horrible customer service danny s has the worst car wash service in the valley i would rather wash my own car or pay a mobile detailer before giving them another penny after they dented my car and then would nt take care of it i will never visit another danny s family car wash or convenient store everyone if you really need a convenient store you should visit the newer circle k on happy valley and th ave
this place is ridiculous ive had pretty mediocre food from here a few times but its down the street from my house so i think i just keep hoping it will get better the carne asada is totally bland and their quesadillas are practically inedible the one good thing is their salsa and bean dip so i just called to place a take out order for a side of bean dip the woman informed me that chips do not come with the bean dip and it would be extra for them lrb do most people eat bean dip without chips  rrb ok fine i will pay the then i ask if salsa is included with the cost of chips to which she replies no salsa is extra as well i hung up everything they were trying to charge me for is free if i was going to sit there and eat my bean dip i think i have finally given up on this place just go to cheba hut next door  rrb
this hotel sucks pm they kick the guests out party poopers
from the moment we walked in i had a bad feeling walking up we smelled great food unfortunately that smell must have been coming from the mexican place next door once we were seated there was a very unpleasant odor we ordered pot stickers sweet and sour chicken and i tried to order beef with snow peas and baby corn i was told lrb awkwardly rrb that this is a real chinese restaurant  no snow peas no baby corn fine we waited a while for food my beef dish arrived to be fair this dish was pretty decent we waited over minutes for my wife s food to show up when it did we were nt sure if it was really bad chicken or really bad pork but either way it was horrible we immediately asked for a box for the beef and the bill when she brought the bill out it had all three items on it with the bill she brought the pot stickers i told her the bill was wrong and that she needed to take the chicken and the pot stickers off she told me you ordered them you must pay i told her the pot stickers came late and the chicken was foul lrb lol rrb and that i could either pay for the beef and walk out or simply walk out she walked to the kitchen and screamed something in chinese then threw the modified bill at our table all the while mumbling in chinese to the other chinese patrons we will not be returning
my husband and i came to town to visit with some friends and we decided to try the diner i decided that with all the up and down reviews it would probably be a fine enough place we were greeted at the door by a very friendly gentleman who welcomed us in it was about in the afternoon and not very busy that was the last of friendliness we experienced it took about minutes to be greeted by our server she took our drink order and left menus after another minutes our drinks came and we placed our order i thought that so far we had been waiting a long time and i was starting to fear the worst of the reviews creeping back into my mind my husband and i ordered the meatloaf with fries and a side of gravy my friend ordered the mac and cheese and her husband a burger with extra cheese and bacon and gravy fries both orders of meatloaf looked very dry even with the gravy on top the side of gravy did nt come out with meal the mac and cheese was runny like it was nt cooked enough or hastily thrown together the burger was looking good but if one piece of cheese is extra cheese when we asked for our side of gravy and my friends husband asked about the extra cheese i felt like we were asking for our meal for free overall the best experience we had was at the door by the gentleman who greeted us the meatloaf was mediocre at best and the gravy a congealed mess and salty along with our alleged fresh cut fries the mac and cheese was not good at all according to my friend but her husband said the burger was good and the pickle that came with it was nice and crunchy i do think that the service staff could be better and more friendly they were very chatty amongst themselves while the ice was melting in our drink glasses and god forbid you question what you were getting i think we will have to pass on this place the next time for sure save your money too and to the gentleman who greeted us so nicely at the door thank you to bad the rest of the staff could nt be more like you
how can you go wrong with a fast food pizza place that is just an assembly line of orders  after a long weekend i did nt want to cook and it was too late to go get some food so i ordered a pizza i figured it s pm and i just wanted to eat something so i ordered from papa johns when i received the confirmation email it said that it was going to arrive in minutes needless to say i just wanted a slice since i was super hungry it was getting so late on a saturday night that i almost fell asleep this pizza did nt show up until am seriously  an minutes for a pizza that is less than one mile from my place i was so hungry at this point i almost did nt care that it took so long but nobody called to say it was going to be late and the pizza showed up ice cold there is no way i was going to reheat a pizza that just showed up at my door it was obviously cooked right when i ordered it and just sat there for over an hour before it was delivered this is the last time i will ever put a tip on my order when i place it online terrible service and an ice cold pizza no explination no sorry for the long wait never again does anyone have the number for pizza hut 
for a sports bar they sure do nt have any channels that have sports other than the ones you get with basic cable lrb yes i know they re in an airport so i should nt expect much but still how  bout at least one premium sports package  rrb so much for trying to watch a hockey game while trying to kill hours at phx because our flight got delayed again not sure what it is about my spring training trips this is the third year in a row my flight home has been delayed over an hour
we have been there about times the first time was great so we went back the last times have been progressively worse to down right disgusting the last time will forever be the last time the food tasted like it had been sitting for hours and when we complained to the manager she said its almost lunch time so they will be bringing new food out soon i was like um what about now  she got flustered and spilled my sons drink on me i was appalled my husband had already paid but she refused to give us a refund even though none of us really ate anything do nt bother going here its over priced and not up to standards of a decent place to eat yuck
their gyros are okay alot of meat in them but i had better small spot weird little employees who acted as if they didnt know how to do their job    unprofessional wouldnt eat here again
oooooo no i love these salad joints able to make a salad exactly how i want it lrb and i m quite picky when it comes to my leafy goodness rrb so frankly when i m the chef how could you possibly mess this up  well when it takes minutes in a completely empty restaurant on a thursday at pm to make a salad my patience gets a little thin i go up to ask the guy when the food might be ready and he totally blows me off waving his hand in dismissal after another minutes we finally got our crepe salads the crepe was dry cold and tasted like paper  the salad was weak with too few ingredients and overdressed to boot and served with sun chips sun chips  seriously  i mean i like them quite a lot but what the heck are they doing on my plate with a crepe salad at a restaurant  i will not be going back and i would not recommend anyone else giving it a shot disappointing and boring just about sums it up
i have been trying to get new glasses and contacts since june my insurance was accepted there and i thought their pricing of decent on the for deals so no worth it rrb the out of state lab has broken frames i had picked out rrb i have waited almost a month on two seperate occasions for my glasses to come in which is much longer than their supposed  day time frame rrb their employees all stand outside together on smoke breaks leaving the store unattended for those that need help rrb i have worn glasses for over years and i have never had such shoddy craftmanwork from their lab  the lenses have popped out in different frames several times the antiglare protection is poor quality that smudges and smears the lenses more than if there was no coating at all rrb their affiliated dr left over months ago and they refuse to give me my rx because the dr has nt gone through the boxes i was instructed to call the dr cell phone number and never heard back rrb a pair of gucci frames i picked out warped when they came back from the lab and did nt fit and verbatim staff said what do you want me to do about it  not worth it when their are so many other more helpful places
i would nt even give this place one star i was walking downtown with some friends and happened to see thai elephant lrb whose tempe location is fairly good rrb so i convinced one to go in and split a dish with me it costs two dollars to split a plate which is fine except they did nt even give us an extra plate and seemed angry that we were sharing lrb also did nt seem very collegestudent friendly in general rrb the waitress just plopped the dish down and walked away there were very few waiters working a packed lunch crowd and this meant the waitress gave us the check immediately after giving us the food and then someone else came and took it before i even had time to ask for a box i m not too upset that i did nt get a box  the food was as awful as the service we ordered the drunken noodles with tofu and it came with thin padthai noodles instead of the wide rice noodles  seems like they were being lazy in the kitchen save your money and support better restaurants downtown
have you ever been to a place  walked out feeling like you were ass raped  well if you re into that you ll love this joint the food is terrible but i felt even worse because it was expensive for the shit they gave you we got a medium sausage which at any other place is a very small pizza and it was with tax  tip lrb no drinks just water rrb do nt be fooled by this gourmet shit either the crust is tasteless  the quality just is nt there when i compare this to say oreganos they are not even in the same ball league skip this joint and save your money
no good if you want good mexican food go to don pancho it on central in avondale not far from this location worth the gas
the girl at the door was unbelievably rude the fish was overcooked really bad and we specifically asked before ordering because not all places do fish well  and were told it was the best nope the soup was ehh and the cotton candy was fine i ca nt remember giving another restaurant a onestar review but i really will never return and i tell everyone who asks not to go there oh and it s incredibly loud i assume they play the music so loud to disguise the conversation of the people sitting far too close to you lrb do they really need to jam that many tables in  rrb horrible
i gave up on this place years ago when it first opened in its original location nothing was priced the owner was incredibly rude and everything i asked for pricing on was strangely  lrb even a lamp i already owned and paid for at a thrift store rrb it was as if he did nt think i was worthy of owning any of his furniture i have since frequently seen him at estate and yard sales around phoenix buying furniture for which i then see priced close to in the shop i have also heard complaints that he has sold recovered furniture as alloriginal vintage give your money to someone kind who is not out to scam you like red is
the worst service in all of chandler i have been here a dozen times and it never improves takes minutes to get a menu and silverware another minutes to place an order and then minute to make an egg i am a person who enjoys supporting nonbig chain local small business but not at the sacrafice of poor service the village in is only miles west of the hanger cafe on queen creek
i live close to here so it is easy but i kick myself in the butt every time i go every time i order to go i get home only to find out they short my order tonight i ordered a taco salad i think i had maybe a  cup of lettuce hidden under a blob of sour cream and blob of guacamole do nt get me wrong i love everything that is part of the salad but key word salad it was one big mush i wo nt say i will not return but in the future i will ask for lettuce and sides
oh boy i am embarrassed that i even attempted to bring my family to this place i am a mother of with picky eaters i have allergies my parents came in for a visit and my father has some dietary restrictions also we happily agreed upon mexican and this place was fairly close service she did what she could it was blatantly obvious they were understaffed or a bunch of lazy bones slow to get our food my father ordered the fajita it was nt smoking steaming blazing nothing it was not hot there were no tortillas to eat the fajitas like a fajita my sons taco was mushed into the beans and he could nt even pick it up to eat like a taco my fish tacos were room temperature and i spat the fishy out seriously gross not eating that no way let s get the server where is she  taking care of way too many tables i will be patient and wait apparently forever my father went and got the manager where was he  at the hostess stand talking to other workers not helping not concerned not getting a good review so the recap is like this sets of utensils for people super slow service cold food management in lala land i shall not return ever
first of all this place is not closed it is open for business unfortunately it does need to be closed i am living out in gold canyon for the next months and if you are not familiar with the area there is nothing out there so when i saw there was a rosati s close by i was extremely ecstatic my first clue should have been there was no one in the parking lot at dinner time i walk in order an antipasto salad this took almost minutes to come out again no one there what were they doing making the lettuce  anyways so the salad come out nothing like a rosati s antipasto salad the entire salad was made of iceberg lettuce which it should not have been the meat was not real and what i mean by that it was rolled lunch meats and cheeses and to top it off lrb no pun intended rrb they gave me packets of italian dressing what  anyone that has every eaten at a rosati s can at least tell you when you order from a rosati s it is consistent this place is nothing like a true rosati s they do not use the same ingredients and the food is garbage rosati s corporate needs to strip their franchise rights
i brought in my saturn to check the ac  it had stopped working just blew out warm air they came back with a quote of no joke the blue book on my car is they said everything was shot  hoses compressor valves they said i needed a whole new ac kit a different shop a different mechanic and later my ac is working just fine and blowing ice cold air i would recommend you get a second opinion before letting this place work on your car
by far hands down the worst chinese food i have ever had in my life i wish i were joking i ordered the usual chicken with vegetables it was taking a long time so i peeked back behind the window the cook if you want to call him that was just goofin off then he casually starts to throw everything in the pan it was awful undercooked everything tough to chew obviously it is a health hazard to undercook chicken the bathrooms were disgusting too stay away from this dump
i m not surprised this place is closing the staff was abrasive the clothing was over priced even on sale
horrible horrible horrible the service here was poor food was all right and nothing about the experience would drive me to go back when we arrived the tone was set there were no more than tables and yet they ran out of menus and it took them over minutes to find enough for our family it took over an hour for our food to arrive and almost minutes for the waitress to take our order after getting our drinks she did more talking with co workers at the bar then working when the food finally came my girlfriends steak was medium rare when she asked for well done and it took them two trips back to the kitchen and the order was still not right and it was still pink the waitress also seem very erratic and very confusing at times almost as if she were drugged or drunk the grill was dead and only a few more families were there it seemed very empty for a bar and grill on ufc fight night the canyon grill was very distasteful and i will never go back i would never recommend this place again
hello i ve been an old customer since they were located on indian school i ve been going to tandooori times for past to years but never experienced such a bad customer service from restaurant owner we were waiting by the bar and the table opened up so we move forward to be seated and another customer grabbed the table without asking anyone else the ppl worked there could nt speak up so we ended up getting a table in the corner at this point we were waiting there for mins on top of that another server grabs our food and serves another table waiter came and apologized and brought our food out mins later i ordered vegetarian dish and she comes out with nonveg dish at this point i m furious and asked for the food to be waived our server calls the owner and he said i do nt serve free food to my own parents denied to give us free food after the whole hoopla and time that was wasted me and my husband used to be huge fan and even though my food was served with hair in it once and i let that go but this made it all worst the owner does nt know how to treat customer do not waste your time and money
i have used dad s for two events a th anniversary and my own wedding first event food was inconsistant dry and unappetizing service was amazing my wedding just the opposite food was great service was a mess servers were late out of uniform in dirty clothing standing out front smoking and drinking did not follow direction a nightmare there were major fails in both events but the worst part is how unresponsive the management was to concernscomplaints it was like we have your money so we do nt care i felt totally blown off and will tell anyone who will listen about my experience i would not use them again for any reason you really do get what you pay for in this case spend a little extra and use a quality caterer who will respond to your concerns and ensure that your event is what you want it to be do nt take a chance here
this more so goes for all corporate movie theaters do the major film companies still question why people download movies  how about the minimum to get in  way overpriced extreme unhealthy food choices  or sitting through  mins of ads   just to be marketed at sad days for the movie theater business
delicious food hideous service we were a party of and waited patiently for minutes for a table in our party was a month old baby four year olds and my year old mother after our extensive wait a party of walked in and began eyeing a table that was clearly about to finish up as the table got up one of the individual s from the other group went up to the hostess told her that they would take that table and our group could have another table lrb that was still seated and eating dessert rrb what  we immediately protested but the hostess had already acquiesced we sat around for another ten minutes kind of shell shocked and trying to decide what to do lrb hungry little ones and a lot of time invested rrb the manager offered nothing other than lukewarm apologies i finally was so disgusted that i left no excuse for seating the other table in front of us too bad the service is so poor because i do like or should i say liked the food
i ran in here for a quick lunch during the week before my pedicure at come for nails in the same strip mall i recognize that i had no right to expect an excellent or perhaps even good meal given that i paid for a lunch that came with a spring roll lrb fried rrb and a soup but i did nt even get a decent meal the only thing i finished was the glass of water what i ordered lrb and received rrb penang beef curry with rice vegetarian spring roll w  standard dipping sauce bowl of rice soup what was wrong the penang curry which i ordered at a level spicy level had an entire wad of unincorporated chili paste in it i found it while i was digging around for another vegetable that was nt the slivers of green pepper and onions that s just lazy cooking even an amateur home chef knows to how to blend something into a sauce the beef was gross it was bland and had no color it looked like the chef chopped it up and nuked it then threw it into the curry and speaking of chopping it was the worst cut job i d ever seen in a restaurant i had several pieces of beef that were stuck together in an unnatural way beef should nt dangle off each other in threes it looked like someone hacked it halfheartedly with his eyes closed the rice was terrible what does this say about an asian restaurant when it ca nt even prepare a standard like that  the rice was mushy so soggy that it was completely unappetizing there s rice that s overcooked and there s mush and this was mushbaby food i soaked it in the curry to pretend like i had ordered curry congee because otherwise i would nt have been able to stomach it the rice soup was interesting i tasted it just to see what flavor it was and i could nt figure it out there were a random zucchini slice in my bowl plus some scallions and it was slightly oily it seemed like the restaurant took some leftover veggie stirfry added rice and boiled them together until the rice had broken down it did nt taste like anything i could figure out which was worrisome i would nt recommend this place to my worst enemy but they do get a star because the service was very attentive
the worst thai i have had ordered medium massaman curry and it lacked flavor it was not spicy and tasted nothing like coconut the potatoes were also still crunchy
i asked for a call from the owner never heard from them  apparently they do nt care either i guess that s why their staff do nt care either
this is the worst donut place i have ever been to this morning i got a dozen donuts here and not only did they charge us an extra cents for adding a tiny cinnamon roll lrb it was the same size as a regular donut so i do nt see the need for a price increase here rrb they only gave us donuts i also ordered a coconut iced coffee with no cream and sugar and surprise it was full of both the woman at the counter made sure to inform me that it was black without cream and sugar like that was nt obvious so it was nt like it was a miscommunication the coffee was also watery and tasted old they also skimped on the coconut flavor i m a pretty big fan of the bagged dunkin donuts coffee you can buy at the grocery store but this was nt the same at all their donuts were also awful they tasted like blobs of plain sugar i got a chocolate cake donut rolled in coconut and you could nt taste the chocolate at all there was almost no flavor also my expensive cinnamon roll had almost no cinnamon i found one little glob of cinnamon down in the roll and the rest was sugary icing i will go ahead and drive to the other side of the to get donuts somewhere else next time i wo nt be going back here again
the mr wanted enchiladas we were in the area i agreed to try this place out neither of us had ever been he proceeds to order cheese enchiladas with no onions and is told everything is premade with onions wtf i wanted to leave but he decided to try the fajitas i got a tostada and tortilla soup not even picture worthy tasted like premade crap and la victoria canned beans so let s just play a fun game with the name here sounds like garcia s barfcia s grosscia s diarrhea s i think you get the picture i would not recommend going here
these guys seemed very nice and they came out and gave me a quote for stump grinding i had trees that i had nt cut down yet but was planning to upon receiving the quote for the stump grinding i needed to make sure i could afford it i received a very reasonable quote from harris and sons and went ahead and cut the trees down and called them back to schedule a time for them to grind the stumps a few days later i spoke directly with one of the guys and he said they would check their schedule for the following week and call me back no one called me back i called again and this time i left a message with their answering service no one called me back so i guess i need to find a new company to do the work unfortunately i budgeted for the quote harris and sons provided and i am finding that the work is much more expensive i wish i would nt have cut my trees down  i could have waited until next year but i knew the trees were declining and since harris and sons provided a reasonable quote i thought i should get it taken care of now i give harris and sons one star because while i appreciate them coming out and giving me a quote in a timely manner not returning calls or honoring the quotes  is really crappy i am feeling pretty sad looking at my barren front yard with big tree stumps sticking out like eye sores
have you ever gone to a sandwich shop that wo nt give you anything on the side with your sandwich  well then visit the jj here on scottsdale rd by kierland and when you want your hot peppers or vinegar or anything else on the side you just wo nt get it here what kind of cheap ja owns this place also owns one on pima and raintree same thing there wont give you anything on the side lol
desperate for a bite to eat i passed this place and quickly turned into the drivethru the building looked like it belonged in the midwest or even the dirty dirty so i ordered the fish sandwich which in my starving haze looked and sounded good but was horrible i asked for no sauce i get the sandwich and it s oozing with white mayo maybe  tarter sauce  so bland and runny on top of the cod that tasted like it was still swimming in the ocean i should have gone to the sonic down the street or better yet nothing in the fast food category fast food disappoints
this is my nd time at udupi cafe and i waited to write a review until a nd visit to be sure the service here is lackluster our waiter actually told us that he only works here and has no input into the chefs cooking when we asked him if we could not have all the vegetables in the mixed pakora platter seriously  the food is mediocre the pakoras are dry and tasteless we had chile pakoras and there was no spice or creativity to them the dosa itself is good the potatoes are very mushy and have minimal taste and their chutneys are not the best quality i would recommend spending more time on working on their food preparation and less time on the wait staff telling us that nothing can be changed as a  indian i would recommend jewel of the crown over this cafe in an instant
so it s new years day i got up at am and drove miles so we could have breakfast at chompies in tempe then catch a showing of the hobbit at arizona mills imax we got our tickets bought a drink found a seat watched the same coming attractions we had seen last week in harkins casa grande when it came time for the movie to start they tuned on the lights and said the projector is broken this showing is canceled they gave us return passes but so what we have lived in this area for years and this is the second time we have been there driving miles to see a movie takes the fun out of it screw you harkins
this place is always a disappointment cheaply made overpriced products the selection in the store is very limited and they do nt have everything that they show on the website you always have to wait to check out even when there are only a handful of customers in the store
could nt really get a feel for the place as i was nt let in bc was wearing a tanktop however i do suggest you wear an affliction shirt seems to be the uniform
horrible on separate occasions i tried to order food from my room at the biltmore big mistake i tried to order a burger but was told they have no hot food available at pm i tried to order a chicken quesadilla at am but was told they have no hot food available i asked how long it wold take to make hot food and they said min but when i called back min later they said  min please note the late night dining menu says food will be available from pm  am this is a complete lie there is no food available during these hours i will never stay here again nor will i recommend anyone i know to this hotel stale outdated very far from parking inconsiderate unhelpful employees and worse
recently listed as one of the top new restaurants in the valley well i made this yelp account just to warn people from eating at this place went on a wednesday night thirty tables in the place and were filled took minutes until we even saw water  another for the first sighting of our waiter ordered drinks and our food when i asked about the size of the dishes i was explained it was a tapasstyle place thought that was funny when each tapas dish was between  does leave you wanting to order many different dishes at that price when my taco plate arrived i bust out laughing there were of them none larger than the diameter of my hand and i have small hands i asked if these were sample tacos or the actual place then ordered a side of beans which for was smaller than your average side of ketchup it was almost funny i felt like i was in the shire eating with bilbo and frodo asked the bus boy for our server several times finally we had to order from the bus boy another round of drinks the table behind us got up and left telling the bus boy lrb the only person actually working rrb that they were nt paying for their drinks because they were done waiting when we finally saw our waiter again no drinks in hand he apologized saying they got busy i guess our of tables filled is busy hey if you re not really hungry and just want to say you went to a top restaurant in scottsdale by all means go or if you just want horrible service and are on a portion control diet go you ll love this place i give them more months before the doors close someone time it
unfortunately you ca nt give negative stars or less than worst service ever service my wife and i received was so bad that i decided to pay the cancellation fee just to get away from them both times my wife and i went in we were forced to wait around and both times and was rudely greeted and helped by the manager i found out that this is a corporate sprint store they could care less if you re happy or not i even sent a nasty gram on sprint s website and got an email back from an executive vp advising that they were going to look in on this and fix the problems
i would try to help a real nonprofit that is out to help the community that have full time jobs and not just people that can wait all day to get services
can you say mama celeste  this restaurant was so unbelieveably bad i had to whip out my notepad and take notes to have the word chicago anywhere near this menu is downright criminal aside from the frozen grocery store pizzalike cheese lrb a sprinkle here and there rrb it had enough salt to melt a chicago winter s thickest ice covered street in seconds i went here today sept rd for a late lunch alright so i m on vacation in scottsdale to scout locations for my future home i ve spent the past years of my life in chicago eating pizza lrb thin crust and stuffed rrb on a weekly basis i read about this place all over and so many people lrb including some deluded dude at the table next to me rrb kept raving about how chicago this pizza is oh my goodness if this is chicago pizza kill me now this was the worst pizza ever i should have known when the waiter guy lrb a chick appeared later rrb said in response to our stuffed cheese pizza order i do nt recommend cheese only he said if you get cheese only its gets pockets that do nt cook all the way and explode when you cut it huh  he was going on about this detriment when i finally cut him off and explained that i was from chicago wanted to compare stuffed pizzas never heard of this but was scared so i ll go with the thin crust my boyfriend looked puzzled but i flat out told him obviously they do nt know what they re doing do nt cook all the way  explode when you cut into it  what  i appreciate his warning but wonder if he was just trying to up sell since more ingredients equals more if that was the case his strategy backfired as i went for the thin crust which was cheaper altogether as it turns out i must thank him as oregano s is a restaurant i would nt recommend to my worst enemy bad bad bad pizza it was actually embarrassing as i stated earlier i overheard a neighbor table mentioning how chicago this pizza was he was nt from chicago but had been there and had pizza from there and thought this oregano s pizza was so good embarrassing i wanted to set him straight so badly but i did nt if this is what arizonians lrb is that a word  rrb think chicago pizza tastes like i must find a home asap and open a real chicago pizza restaurant i m so embarrassed seriously embarrassed
i had to go here as a kid i was busted shoplifting and sent here for a day it was crazy i met a guy from my highschool there and we are bestofriends still lrb yrs later rrb we were the only ones there that were not drunk loaded or in trouble for beating someone up til near death
as i sit in this airport i d like to share my experience while i wait hours for my delayed flight to depart you are making a huge mistake if you contemplate flying with allegiant you will fall victim to false affordable prices my listed price of round trip was escalated to after all their additional charges lrb carry on luggage reserving any seats rrb we paid additional fees to get on the pm flight and this incompetent airline just let the pm vegas flight leave before us this airline stresses all over that you need to arrive exaggerated time before your flight and so i took of work with my only vacation time this year to drive min to the airport in the middle of nowhere at pm there was no staff to be found in their one terminal or to explain why the flight has not boarded that is because allegiant does nt have any staff here just the oblivous and rude airport staff here to deal with their customers we saw an allegiant manager for min who cowered in front of an angry mob and offered no apologies or compensation he has now retreated back to sad cave and i doubt we will ever see this unqualified loser again i m currently surrounded by passengers that have been waiting for a different flight to leave and it is currently everyone in this poorly air conditioned terminal is on their phone having to cancelreschedule their plans because of this airline and airports inability to execute the few flights they have daily i fly all the time for work and liesure  never had a worse experience they do not have their act together and if my return flight is anywhere near this awful f u allegiant and this airport ps this airline will stress you beyond measure and not allow you to smoke a fing cigarette anywhere
do nt believe the hype i heard about their awesome margaritas and decided to give them a shot before leaving arizona first the bartender was an a  hole i asked for the rita i ve been hearing so much about and he serves me some frozen thing with chambord i told myself this must not be the thing i ve heard such ravings about so decided to choke that thing down along with their sad excuse of chicken tortilla soup  which had very little cheese and chicken but plenty of broth that looked like diarrhea after all of this grossness i asked the bartender for the better rita that is not frozen he told me that their best ritas were the frozen ones when i heard that i got zhell outta that place ca nt wait to be back home in dallas for a real rita at ojeda s and monica s
very unprofessional staff and the salon is small and tight it is not clean and i even pointed out a cockroach out to them she just picked up a broom and swept it up no apologies or anything from the girl brushes combs and scissors were all dirty with hair very disgusting the floor had hair all over and it started making hair ball that s how old it was eww please do nt go here you will waste your time and more importantly your money just do nt go trust me
i have been a loyal customer for many years until recently sunday morning i thought i d take my car to get cleaned since it had been forever since i had done so i had never had an issue with their service until i came home and noticed my car was still dirty and the inside doors still had scuff marks on them a few weeks back i had ran over some gum and it got on the body of the car well they did nt bother to clean the gum off and i still had bird poop on the hood of my car as soon as i walked in the door i called them and spoke to a very rude manager he implied that i put the gum there and the bird feces um do nt think so i live in central phoenix and he demanded that i drive all the way back up there so he could see what i was talking about i told him that i had been a customer for almost years now and he still called me a liar he told me the chances of me getting my money back are slim to none i will make it my sole purpose in life to tell everyone i know never to use this car wash again why would i spend on a car wash just to put gum and bird crap on it myself  i must love throwing money away like it s nothing lol seriously do not use them
this is my first review on yelp and samarkand is the restaurant that inspired me to register and write my first review unfortunately this is not a good thing this restaurant was utterly disappointing and has set a new low point in my culinary experience i went in for lunch on a monday with a friend we walked in to the restaurant to find it empty and decorated with happy st birthday banners we thought that they were closed for a private party and my friend suggested we should go somewhere else i should have listened after spending a minute or two shouting hello we were greeted with a nice lady who assured us they were open and sat us down on one of the many empty tables the place was clean but had a funky smell to it since we had never had russian food we decided to be adventurous we ordered some home made fruit drink that did not agree with our palates and sumsa lrb which is bread filled with ground beef and onions rrb to start with we also ordered some bread lrb ca nt remember the name rrb to eat with our marinated lamb and marinated beef sheesh kabobs fruit drink did not finish not for us not sweet had an odd aftertaste sumsa did not finish tasted and smelled like the meat filling had gone rancid before cooking bread majority consumed tasteless but edible marinated beef did not finish tough chewy and tasteless marinated lamb did not finish chunks of fat on bone no meat to be seen absolutely disgusting needless to say i will not be returning or recommending this place to anyone i wish i could rate this place to zero stars but yelp does not allow for it note no one else came in to eat at the restaurant the entire time we were in it lrb peak lunch hour time rrb
zero stars this place is a joke the hotel looks like housing projects the rooms are horrible i lost money because i refuse to stay here and the general manager ed was the most unhelpful piece of crap he told me to stop whining and would not fix any of my issues stay a feet away this place should be condemned
take two shots of penicillin and a tetnus shot after eatingdrinking here and for god s sake stay out of the bathrooms do nt believe me check out the expert reviews on maricopa gov restaurant ratings pretty yuk
my fiance and i decided to go out for sushi last minute and decided on stingray s happy hour we sit at the sushi bar every other time we have been here and have always had decent service this time was a completely different story we asked to sit out back on the patio and take advantage of the degree weather worst decision we made all day our waitress whom we had nt had the pleasure of meeting yet was busy letting the customers behind us know she forgot to put one of their rolls in and it would nt be out for another ten minutes after she left you could hear the disappointment as they talked about how good the food was but the service was terrible i knew this was gonna be a completely different experience than we were used to after hearing that literally minutes later my waitress has nt even acknowledged our presence and i m getting rather parched at one point i asked my fiance if this was a sushi buffet and we were just unaware after the jokes about their service i took the menu up with our rolls marked off and kindly found the girl who seated us i asked her if i was supposed to walk the menu up to the sushi bar myself and put my order in then i asked here where the glasses were for water so i could proceed to go pour us some water behind the bar needless to say it still took another five minutes to finally meet our server after the confrontation from here on out it was smooth sailing and we had our little sushi rolls that we thoroughly enjoy we discussed over dinner if i should say something to the manager or not and finally at the end decided a minute wait in this type of industry is just unexplainable so when the bill came i asked for the manager and he promptly came out and acknowledged that she only had tables in her corner and there should have never been that long of a wait i agreed thanked him for understanding and proceeded to pay my bill he never offered to adjust it in any way and i decided since he was nt adjusting my bill for his establishment s terrible service i would nt adjust my tip to show the server any compensation for his lack of judgement from now on we will always sit at the sushi bar because it has never been a bad experience i can see my rolls being made and the sushi chefs are way more funny and sadly more competent than the rest of the staff
this was my hope for a good get away and it did nothing for me just to take the kids out and enjoy a day near the water service was fine being seated inside with pretty girls it s a big dated but it s better to sit outside for sure for more room waitresses were nice but very slow tea refills per few and far between and food was not worth the money food did come in a timely fashion onion rings were very bland and simple and would not order them again nacho s with pork and beans on them was not even close to very good the best thing on the chips was the real cheese sour cream and jalapeno s blue cheese burger was just par nothing to write home about unless it s on yelp i wo nt be going back especially since i paid to get into the part to eat i hope the owners and managers read yelp i would hope you would try to spice things up more people want a place to go and have a decent food ice cream for the kids and alcohol for all the others this could be a killer location and place but i have been very spoiled by antelope marina at lake powell
horrible horrible horrible we had reservations since september for a master suite they checked us into a jr without even the courtesy of acknowledging it when we called them on it the concerierge just handed me the phone for the number in florida of course they could nt do anything about it but offer me a gift card the jr was nt even big enough for the of us lrb which is why we booked a master rrb the pull out sofa was broken and had screws protruding no wifi are you kidding me this is is nt it  what exactly is the five star villa experience  the staff was terrible the room was star at best run from this place
in an effort to start on a positive note i will say that this place has a nice atmosphere it s a very open space and i could see myself enjoying a beer on the patio during happy hour if only the happy hour prices were desirable enough to prompt a return visit this is not a place you want to visit with intent to enjoy vietnamese food as it is overpriced and for lack of better words gross the roll we ordered for an appetizer was okay but the serving size was shameful considering the price and the peanut sauce i requested on the side was very watery pho was the man dish and it was nt any better in fact it was worse and with fake meat and funky flavor it was left unfinished it makes me sad to think that someone may have their first vietnamese dining experience here and potentially never eat it again as a result i hope the owners consider sprucing up their recipes or if nothing else dropping the nd half of their name so that patrons visiting with the intent to dine on vietnamese cuisine wo nt be left disappointed
i ve recently moved into the neighborhood and decided to try ihop today a big mistake after i was seated i just waited and waited for someone to take my order and it s not that they were busy the place was practically empty i saw waiters just walking past me avoiding eye contact they did nt even bother to tell me that someone would be with me shortly or something like that customer service anyone  finally a waitress came along and i told her that i ve been waiting for a long time she was apologetic and nice and came to check upon me  times during the meal but by that time they had totally ruin my saturday with their pathetic service and i do nt care attitude none of the people working there looked like they wanted to be there at all i m not going back which is a shame as the place is right next to my apartment
came here for lunch on a weekday no karaoke was going on so there was no reason to come here the service was absolutely terrible we spent over minutes most of it waiting for service the bill and for the waitress to pick up the bill i gave up on using a credit card and used cash instead so we could get out of there i had a bowl of chili my wife had a salad and mom had soup and a wrap although the food was not terrible it was nothing special and combined with the lousy service we were very disappointed unless you want to do karaoke at night do not eat here
please  scuze my french in this review but i am pissed off cool cafes are hard to come by in the valley tempe s gold bar is one of them and it s been here a long time i go back a long ways with this one having spent many late nights studying for the bar exam here the fucking assholes who own starbucks knowing this place s popularity decided to plant one of their cancerlike franchise locations in the very same plaza just  yards away an obvious attempt by a boring uncreative national franchise to bully a local favorite out of business boycott this location please i think the local favorite gets the last laugh though as i drove by the starbucks in amazement at their hostile choice of location it looked totally devoid of customers to me the gold bar however is packed and i had to sit at an outside table in the cold for mins before a single chair inside freed up there s a live jazz band playing at the moment life is good fuck you starbucks
omg we went just for drinks and the sand bag game outside a gin and tonic was four people six drinks later and one sand bag game i left there paying tip included way too much money i wont order from there again lrb
hmmm guess they transported all that grease from chi city as well my bread turned into a liquid from all that grease
amazing pizza the bar area is way too small and i was a big fan until i noticed the no firearms sign really your restricting law bidding citizens from entering your restaurant i havent been back
this place is gross the first thing i noticed was how greasy the floors were we got seated in the back kind of upstairs the place is rundown and needs attention the ceiling above was dripping water right in our booth the food  big portions of tasteless slop nothing was edible the eggs had no flavor at all hashbrown portion huge but again a blob of mush underneath like nothing i ve ever seen or tasted there was cheese on my toast were did that come from  we did nt eat but a few bites i paid and tipped as the waitress was nice but never going back the place was packed so someone must like it not i
rude staff slow service they wanted me to wait hours for a spring replacement i called another company and they came out within hour go anywhere other than smokey s
it s official they are after the dollars i want to say crooks but it may be too harsh my husband and i went to smiles of beauty for years but got fed up with all the phone calls and what seemed to be bogus procedures that insurance did nt pay for there were numerous talks in a closed office about our additional financial responsibilities above and beyond insurance they mainly targeted my husband who on a couple visits they told him had cavities which he has nt had in years most recently telling him that they would nt even clean his teeth because he needed a deep cleaning laser procedure immediately lrb which was nt covered by insurance rrb my husband set up the appointment but due to a business appointment he had to reschedule the lady in the office called me to tell me how serious his condition was and to make sure i get him in asap well that did nt feel right so he went to my new denist dr garrett guess what his teeth are great and no cavities there were no deep pockets and it was a pleasant visit in my opinion the dentist is nt my favorite place but when you mix that with them making you think your teeth are going to fall out it s even worse steer clear my yelp friends
this place is great if you bring a group of friends and ignore everyone else cause it s a meat market everyone there seems to think they have the right to stare even touch the only times i ve ever been is for a bar crawl or because someone wanted to meet there honestly  i m not sure what the appeal is much more interesting gay bars in phoenix have closed and yet this one keeps truckin along perhaps they have loyal patrons some look like they ve been coming for decades
i went here i once with my friend that was visiting we both got sick i vomited in the middle of the night my friend was sick for two days i think they put something in our food i am never going there again stay away from here
i really ca nt see ever going back here unfortunately unless it s for a tube or something very generic bought an overpriced bike computer here on saturday there were older guys in there one pretty useless and then the other one who was more helpful came back on sunday because i could nt get it to measure the speed only the useless older guy was there seeming overwhelmed with the customers in the store and severely out of breath from having to bring a repaired bike out from the back he had no idea what to do and said his mechanic was in on tuesday then he asked me if i d even bought the computer there i said yes about hours ago and we d even talked for a while during the purchase i guess he did nt recognize me or the computer that his store sold anyways  landis is nt that far away  definitely go there instead palo verde has about bikes for sale in the store and about of everything else  so do nt expect to have much choice in anything not sure if anyone in this store had been on a bike in the past years landis is on shea  scottsdale and has a ton of bikes for sale a lot of other gear  equipment and a fully stocked repair shop
only one thing i can say for this place gross
i exchanged emails with the owner of this place and he has done nothing to correct my previous experience i will not go back
we heard great things about this place so we thought we d try it maybe it was a bad night but we had terrible service and food they never came over to refill our drinks or check to see how our meal was when they finally came over at the end of our meal to see if we needed anything else and to bring us the bill we told the waitress that the chicken dish was terrible and we did nt eat it her response was would you like to take it togo  um no did nt you just hear we said it was terrible  they did nt take it off the bill either which is what she should have done like i said maybe they had a new cook and waitress that night because we have heard from others that it is good just not for us very disappointing
saturday night and pearl was turning customers away they actually refused to service any more customers not because there was a wait not because they ran out of sushi but because they were short a barback and the bartender was slammed the place was probably  full and the bartender was standing around she did nt look even close to being slammed i have never in my life been turned away from a restaurant because they were too busy especially when they were not at capacity i ve been a waitress a hostess and my father owned a bar and restaurant that got so packed on saturday nights that the cocktail waitresses could barely move through the crowd i thought it was a horrible decision to turn people away i ve been overwhelmed by customers before so i think i have the right to call bullshit on this i worked at a bakery and coffee shop when i was and constantly found myself alone during the morning rush i took the order made the order and brought it to the customers i did nt turn people away i worked my ass off hustling and apologized sweetly if there was a delay in fact i even got complimented on how hard i was working by the customers themselves the point i did nt see one damn person hustling in there if you are going to turn people away because the staff is overwhelmed then i would expect to see some people hustling i am so confused as to how being short a barback equals turning away customers i will never go back to this poorly managed restaurant in my life just to be clear i was nt rude to the sweet little girl who turned me away because i knew it was nt her decision but the manager should have been out there explaining the problem with a little more diplomacy if you are going to turn people away then figure out the right way to say it so that they will actually come back if i was the owner or manager i would have done every job in the place trying to lend an extra hand so that i did nt have to turn customers away i would buss tables and wash dishes if i had to maybe i m a bitch but i m a bitch that knows how to get shit done whoever managesowns pearl  you do not this message is for you do nt send your little baby workers to turn away customers they do nt know how to do it without pissing people off also telling people that you are not going to give them service because you want them to get the service they deserve is a crap thing to say you are not a fine dining establishment and according to some of your reviews your service is nt all that great i guess i m never getting the service i deserve because i m never going back what a disaster
we were first ones here for lunch and kids eat free so i figured why not i ordered forbidden rice w chicken it arrrives raw i had to search for a server and she removed the chicken from my plate again we wait and wait it never came before my meal was finished ha to find another server to ask tjey cxl chicken at this point and just bring bill they tried to ofer it to go no thanks wanted it as part of meal we will not be back
horrible nothing on the menu under nothing on the menu worth cobb salad  salad drenched in dressing a puddle formed at the bottom of the plate it could have saturated an entire roll of brawny paper towels iced tea wow wife had turkey wrap inedible as well thunder and lightning not fun for kids under overall review super overpriced horrible food will never go back
after a few visits that were far from exciting i decided to give them another chance it was on the fly had a group of teen girls that needed fed i ordered the pc meal mash slaw and mac the sides were fine yet hard to screw up premade side items the biscuits were hot yet oddly enough half of them were only the top half the chicken the meat of the meal and matter was thighs breasts legs and wing an odd bird considering it should have been a straight pieces each my family does nt really care for the thighs daughter likes legs and wings wife and i are breast people lrb yes i know how that sounds rrb we figured the dogs would like the thighs so you can imagine our thought when the one piece we were tolerating dominated the bunch i walked back in the store and everyone that has ever worked behind a restaurant counter knows that when a strange person walks into the store with restaurant bags it is nt a good sign so when she asked what i wanted i politely asked for the mod she did nt understand i asked again but for the manager on duty she still did not or choose not to understand me i then asked more times it was a really bad game of whose on first to the point that the other customers were laughing the general manager came out and i explained the situation he politely said he would fix the situation packed up breasts and sent me on my way i was nt thrilled but did nt want to waste my day on this upon arriving home finally getting the chance to eat myself i put one on the plate with some mashed the exterior of the chicken looked fine but the minute i took a bit and started to chew the rancid flavor and odor hit me after excusing myself for thirty minutes to the bathroom i returned to examine the chicken the exterior and  inch into the chicken looked normal the remaining interior of the chicken was a complete mushy mess that chicken was so far from it s sell by date that i ca nt believe i did nt catch it on first examination i will say though it has been hours and i still have not been able to get that taste out of my mouth or get my stomach settled and i was in the army and have a pretty tough stomach but rotten chicken now to add insult to injury i was exceedingly polite to both the drive thru teller for the extreme wait and the store manager because i explained to them that i once was a kfc gm and dm so i knew what it was like to be in their shoes so if anything i hope this review has a bit more weight i know what the standards are at kfc and know that this location falls far short of them to the point of it being a safety issue what is sad this cost forty bucks hours of my time and who knows how long to recover it was a far cry from hot fresh and fast just glad i got to the rancid chicken before my family did
noise from other guests running up and down the hall all night i booked and prepaid for a room with two beds at wwwhiltoncom when i arrived i was informed that they do not have any rooms in inventory with two beds and that sometimes websites get it wrong although i am able bodied i was given a handicap room with inconveniences like a shower head that would nt go higher than 
went to mucho gusto on christmas eve with family it was a chilly night and we saw that it got good reviews on yelp so we stopped in for a early visit  thought some good mexican food and a margarita would warm us up our wonderful plan was sabotaged by the worst hostess ever it was early and the place was empty we asked to be seated  there were of us  and she proceeded to seat us at a person table right next to the door lrb remember it s cold outside there are of us and the place is completely empty rrb as she was setting us up we asked to be sat at a larger table farther away from the door she gave us the death stare my poor family in from out of town iced over by some evil control freak she then reluctantly sat us at another top lrb we had to drag over another table to fit us all in rrb and proceeded to complain to the server lrb within earshot of us rrb about us pointing and rolling her beady little eyes it was then we decided that it just was nt worth it  we left lrb with no apologies from any of the other staff rrb and went to ztejas instead i would have much rather supported a local establishment but there is no need for that kind of tude especially on christmas eve
first of all johnny chu should be ashamed to call himself a chef he is barely a line cook as stated in previous reviews he does nt even taste his own food lrb which accounts for the wide margin of variety a single dish may have on two different visits rrb so i made reservations thinking i may be able to sit at the bar because i arrived minutes early wrong i was ordered to wait outside nearly minutes later and a drink at the bar next door i inquired about my table the girl did nt even look up at me to acknowledge i had said anything after a minute or so of staring at her while she continued to ignore me she finally said my table was ready hmm the food is horrible i fear those of you who enjoy it rather enjoy the atmosphere and come here to be seen the food is either completely bland lrb eg my curry which tasted of water with a slight hint of something i could nt even recognize rrb or so hot as to mask any possible flavor by calling themselves authentic asian cuisine is just silly there are so many holeinthewall asian restaurants that could cook chu under the table blindfolded so the rude nonexistent service the insanely overpriced food and to be seen is what you re paying for if you enjoy being treated like shit and fed food that i would nt feed in a troth for pigs  you may enjoy this place and good for you
the first night i went here i had an italian beef sandwich i thought there was something wrong with it because it had a strange flavor but then i heard from other people that went there that their sandwich also had a strange flavor the beef was also powdery not sure what is going on with this but it is not good we also ordered chicago style hot dogs they are not chicago style which is what i would expect from a company that is from chicago it did not have a poppy seed bun it did not have a pickle spear it did not have tomatoes
ok i am going to apologize in advance to all those nice folks who like this place  you got jeeped this was one of the most unappetizing lunch i had in the looong time cold rice bland chicken nonfriendly service somewhat expensive not spicy  nogh fo yo  i bring hot sauce huh  wtf i do not want hot sauce i want properly prepared dish i never came back and neither i intend to i no like eugene
i m of asian descent born in the states and i am pretty familiar with my chinese food parents were visiting from the bay area and we had already visited the chinese cultural center so i thought we could hang closer to home very cute and clean restaurant plate full of fried wonton skins as well as a pourable container of sweet  sour sauce were awaiting at every table which made me skeptical as to how long it had been sitting there decent prices service was fast and friendly my parents had the egg drop soup to start they said the soup was not bad as it had pieces of chicken and water chestnut throughout good start my mother had the teriyaki chicken and my father and i had the shrimp in lobster sauce large portions and wafting aromas were very promising i was so hoping that this place would have good chinese food it is freeway close not too many miles from home alas we were very disappointed in the meals the teriyaki chicken lrb bummed also that it did not come with any veggies rrb over rice was drowned in a heavily salted and sugared teri sauce there was not one iota of white left in the rice she had pieces and stopped granted the chicken was not over done and it was all breast meat the shrimp with lobster sauce also drowned but in a heavily salted lobster sauce lots of shrimp but not very edible on our taste scales
we waited over an hour for a table the hostesses were beyond rude the food was ok but definitely not worth the wait do nt waste your time
dropped a duece in this place and i dont mean cash
i ca nt say much on there quality of service as i have never been to the place however i will comment on their drivers they are rude and have no regards for other people they inconvience i was leaving the local coffee shop in the drive through and right as i started to leave one of their drivers parks his truck right in front making it impossible for me to turn in the direction i needed to go as the guy got out of his truck i asked if he could move so i could get out he then lrb smirkingly rrb intructed me to go in the opposite direction clearly not willing to move his truck i can understand if he was loading a car or something of the sort and needed to be right there but he was nt all i have to say on this is if he was nt willing to take seconds out of his day to move how much care and consideration do they have on a bigger job  i would nt trust them
i had heard positive things about this place so when i found a groupon for this place i knew we had to try it out this place was a complete let down we went for lunch one day hoping for a quick bite to eat this place was packed but it was no excuse for how bad it smelled it smelled terribly lrb like stinky feet rrb the brought out some  fresh pickles as a starter for the meal the pickles tasted like cucumbers they had not even started the pickling process yet i only ate them because i was starving at that point but normally i would have passed completely the service at this restaurant was downright embarrassing our waitress was in pajamas i am not joking she came to our table two times one to take our order and the other when she finally dropped off the check lrb after hunting down another employee to get it rrb when we showed her we had a groupon she acted as if we were asking her super tasking almost a personal favor we received more service from the other staff than our own waitress the portions were really small especially for the price  bucks for a sandwich i expect it to be decent i have been to much better sandwich joints that were more affordable with awful service and mediocre food i do not think i will ever come back
while the actual bus and driver they sent to take us on our trip was great working with them was a nightmare i d never use them again they charged my credit card while holding a check for payment and telling me they absolutely would not charge my card on the phone i did nt find out till a week later when i got my charge card bill and the uncashed returned check then nobody would take responsibility as to why it happened and the customer service rep who promised to call me once he found out what happened never did no attempt to make it right either
the concept was a great one but the festival and the food trucks were no where close to prepared for the amount of people that showed up not sure if it was great marketing or groupon but there were way too many people there or way too few of food trucks if this event happens again next year i would advise to either double or triple the amount of food trucks or cap the number of attendees i would also advise of having this at a different venue or get new traffic control management this was our day in a nutshell waited minutes to park this was a little frustrating but we were so excited it did nt seem that bad once we entered the event we noticed right away the lines for the food trucks were very long we game planned to split up and get in two lines little did we know the lines were so slow at one food truck there was a line to get tickets then go to another line lrb epic hotdogs rrb almost an hour and a half later we finally get some food the hotdog was cold and obviously the ingredients had changed a little bit while we were in line the had ran out of some ingredients and were improvising so frustrating needless to say we were able to hit only one more truck each unfortunately we did nt go to this event to be separated the next food truck the owner of the truck lrb gourmet frybreads rrb was extremely rude and obviously overwhelmed with the situation we all left hungry and very let down i have nt even talked about the cost of everything i had no problem with the parking and the cover if things were the way i expected everything was way too expensive for the experience the food was way overpriced for a half a hotdog for a frybread with beans  really now the food trucks are gouging us beer  well if you wait at the tent for a beer it s the beer seemed like a better deal seeing i did nt have to wait minutes i hate to write reviews like this because i am just repeating what others are saying if you decide to do this event next year i am sure you will make adjustments it will have to be a lot for us to go back great concept but horrible execution
by far the worst place i ve ever eaten selection and quality is horrible sushi was like rubber they had store bought pound cakes and cookies for desert the salad bar consisted of lettuce cheese croutons with your choice of dressing everything i tried was not good guess we ll head to burger king after paying our bill for buffets of disgustingness seriously do not waste your money
the first question that comes to my mind upon considering this or any other walmart is how much will they pay me to take the stuff they keep in that store  i m the last to jump on any semisocialist soapbox railing against walmart for crimes against workingclass humanity hell i shop at target and they are nt necessarily a mom and pop business most jobs in bigbox stores do nt pay a living wage and when i go to a megastore as a consumer i do nt expect the human touch i am looking for an efficient experience in obtaining something i need lrb or really probably only want rrb for a reasonable price it s just that at walmart the combination of the herd mentality of their regular visitors the lighting of the store the demonstrably lower quality of the items they carry the indifference of their employees and the management s general willingness to treat their customers like shrinkage risks makes me wonder if maybe the soviets won the cold war anyway or maybe it was the red chinese who won so to me walmart has fallen from being a symbol of vigorous capitalism at its best lrb back in the early s rrb to a symbol of how individual dignity gets trampled when it comes up against the lowestcommondenominator needs of the collective da commrade five year industrial plan bucket of pickles only you buy now i guess there s nothing i need that badly unless they are paying me to take it even then
i recently moved to this area and i have to say this fry s has one of the worst customer service in the pharmacy department that i have ever dealt with i had to wait for almost hours in the store for a prescription and when i was finally called up they failed to put in my insurance information correctly so they tried to charge me for the full prescription when i brought to there attention they accused me of giving the incorrect info which makes no sense since i gave them my sons insurance card with his name then a customer that i guess is familiar with the staff stopped by to say hello and was allowed to walk up to my window and stand right next to me while she asked my personal information i guess they are not aware of hippa law i ended up getting a hold of what i think was a store manager lrb he wore a red vest rrb and to bring the issue to his attention and he asked for me to stop back by the store i thought he was going to ask to further discuss the issue and let me know how it would be resolved but instead he left a gift card for at customer service station for me to pick up i just donated it to a local homeless shelter
this place always sucks waited min in the only line to order a scone once i got to th head of the line the guy behind the counter told me he could nt get it for me but he d get someone who could really you ca nt put a scone that s feet away in a bag  but you can walk about feet and go through a door for  minutes to get someone else to do it while we all continue to wait  so anyway he comes back out and takes next person in line while i wait more min for someone to finally come out from the back lrb seriously i timed it rrb then that person told me she had to make sandwiches first seriously  put a scone in a dang bag so at this point i left irritated because of min wait  still did nt get the scone i came in for instead i drove up the street to wildflower where i was in  out with a scone in minutes with a line take note paradise this is one reason why wildflower is so much better than you lrb aka you suck rrb paradise is more like paradise lost i wo nt be back
i was excited to try a new sub place even if it was in a mall i saw they had a deal for a philly cheese steak and fries for the guy asked if i wanted to add a drink for a more i said sure then my total was eight something i thought boy that s a lot of tax turns out the drink was actually not a big deal and i was nt going to fight over cents but why did they lie to me  weird then i get my sub and it s basically the size of a six inch from subway great i finished it in about bites have you ever had those philly cheese steak sandwiches from costco  they are in the frozen section you microwave them i think those are actually better than these i wo nt be going back here the food is a rip off i would nt mind paying for mall food if it was really good  sarku sbarro etc but this crap is nt worth even if you want i can take a dump and wrap it up and sell it to you for probably would be more nutritious and taste better too
i hate them do nt shop at sears way too over priced their price match policy is bogus they wo nt work with you on deals regardless of what it says just go to lowesbest buywalmart  home depot etc etc rumors have been said they will not exist after what does that tell you  just an fyi every thing you could possibly call about is outsourced and the delivery team is extremely rude to talk to regardless if you are a customeremployee whatever lrb do nt ask me how i know i just do wont get into it rrb sears may have awesome deals on appliances but i can guarantee that if you go down the street and pay a little bit more elsewhere it will be worth it in the long run as far as manufacturer warranties and customer service with problems and the delivery and installation will be  smoother than sears mattresses  do not buy here i can tell you right now and i kid you not that for your mattress to come in pristine condition and for it to feel amazing is very unlikely because with delivery again its unlikely it will come in perfect once i pay off my sears bill i will not be entering any sears and i will never step foot in this particular sears for the rest of my life unless threatened
no more we have been regular customers for about five years now and were so treated like crap tonight that we will not be coming back service and food is always pretty hit and miss but we kept coming back because when it was good it was good we ordered their filet tacos which always come out cold but the flavor is usually pretty good tonight it comes out not only cold but greasy and has no guacamole on it we tell the waitress and she sends it back a little later she brings out a new dish that had the tacos so cold that the cheese was not even melted barely any meat on it and the guacamole and pico de gallo on the side huh  we complain she sends the manager over and she lrb the manager rrb who has known us for a few years now is very snarky and rude to us about it she does nt understand why we are not happy with everything on the side ok well if that is how you treat regulars see ya to top it off we were overcharged for the side of guacamole we ordered and the service was terrible the second half of our meal we canceled the order and left this is a place you definitely take your chances at
at best this is mediocre food the hot sauces were not the chili rellano was a rice filled burrito with one strip of chile and no rellano do nt go here
the place is busy and we thought we d try it on a wed night the waitress was too busy flirthing with the guy patrons and we could not get served so we left
zero zero zero took a picture of what i found in the restroom ten feet from me can get the same mex food at cirkle k was sick for days never again
never again i have to go to avis because they re one of my company s preferred vendors but i ll have to make an exception next time service was mediocre however when i got to the car to my surprise it was a tiny little chevy aveo which i imagine is an automobile only used for rentals since no one in their right mind would purchase a vehicle like that if that was nt bad enough the car was nt cleaned  filthy inside and out the clock in the car was about hours off there was no power steering and the navigation system kept on falling apart almost causing me to get in an accident every time i took a turn i d recommend any other car rental co over avis
i visit the gilbert and warner location frequently i ve had fairly consistently good service and food at that location this location is another story after taking our drink order lrb waters and soda rrb it took over minutes for the server to actually bring it blaming the bar for the delay even though she filled the cups at the soda station next to our table after our food was ordered half the food was brought to our table right away leaving half our party without their meals for another minutes we had two orders of wings one order was covered in sauce the other had a dab on each piece it was for an extra side of sauce after clearing our food we waited minutes for the server to bring our bill then another for our server to actually run payment needless to say she got a tip on a bill if you are in gilbert just go to the one on gilbert and warner the service is better the food is better  it was worth the drive
bait and switch the menu that is online is not the same menu that is in the restaurant the online menu lists several vegetarian dishes the restaurant menu does not when my sister and i arrived we each knew what we were going to order but did not see those dishes on the menu plan b she went with a lemon grass beef dish with rice i reluctantly ordered the chicken noodle soup i had them swap out the chicken and replace it shrimp i should have known better but i was hungry and not think clearly later that afternoon i became queasy and threw up i do not believe i became sick because the food was bad i think it was because of the chicken broth it s been a while since i ve eaten meat and the chicken broth did not agree with me now to be nit picky the chairs are hard and uncomfortable the waitress was a bit odd she kept steering diners away from a particular table saying it was because she just lit some incense my sister and i watched her tell diners they could not sit there then a lone man comes in and sits there favoritism at the viet kitchen  do not go here if you are vegetarian vegan prefer a table up front or dislike hard chairs
ok we are new to the area and are still trying to find our favorite restaurants we thought we would try this place based on other yelp reviews the restaurant itself is ok just as you would expect for a chinese strip mall restaurant the food was comparable to getting safeway chinese food lrb so i thought rrb my husband and i were unable to finish our meals lrb large portions rrb when we went to eat the leftovers the next night my husband yells from the kitchen is it gross that i just found a rubber band in my left overs  omg yes that is gross are you kidding me  how the heck did a rubber band get in our food  and if there is a rubber band in there i do nt even want to know what else is in there sick i would never eat here again
well thanks to all the unhappy people leaving they warned me and my friends to not waste our time standing in line we stood in line for about minutes before we decided that we were nt going to wait to go in a building with the or so other sweaty people to possibly drink some warm beer luckily our half priced from deal chicken was refunded lucky for all the other bars in old town that we graced with our presence because of this failed event maybe next time they should nt curse their event by calling it winterfest when it s degrees out in the sun
i m not a fan of fried burgers and i gotta say the burger was weak no flavor to it was as if you bought a package of ground beef put it in a frying pan at home and did nt season it at all best burger in jacksonville they advertise  thanks now i know i do nt need to ever visit jacksonville actually they have signs all over the place touting themselves ya know you could take down the signs and let the food speak for itself but yeah you ca nt let the burger speak for itself when the burger sucked let s put up more signs the toppings options were awesome i ca nt see myself going back for a burger but the toppings might get me in to try a hot dog
i really do nt understand how there can be this many positive reviews of this place the gyro was sub par very little meat and the tzatziki was watery the chicken schawarma had an odd taste to it as well i would rate gyro express and the hungry monk wayyyy better and they are both within a mile of this place save your cash go anyplace else
when we walked in saturday at around for dinner we were the only ones in the place the two employees were sitting at one of the tables looking like the last thing they wanted to do was get up and actually have to cook something the tables were dirty no one was in there they were sitting on their  sses and half the tables were filthy when our food finally arrived they sat right back down and resumed doing nothing with each other and had pretty filthy mouths i m colombian i look pretty latin too what made them think i would nt understand them when your the only ones in a place and you get up to leave and no one asks how was everything or says something lrb er like customer service rrb thanks for coming in  then i d say there s some pretty fundamental problems happening the worst part as we were driving out of the parking lot we saw an in  out burger and it was packed big mistake going to this place i ve been to fatburger before a few times in california not a bad burger this place is managed horribly with lazy employees do not go here check out the in  out burger at the rear of the parking lot rrb
i had the macaroni and cheese which was very good but the server and hostess were so rude and slow that i ll never go back again we knew what we wanted right away and i asked if we could put in our meal order after he took our drink order lrb waters please rrb and he straight up said no i ll take your order after i bring your drinks so rude our server never came to check on us after we got our food we had been done with our meal for about five minutes and our server walked right by me i looked at him and waved to him as he walked by to get the check and he completely ignored me i ll never ever go back
it s peanut butter jelly time peanut butter jelly time peanut butter jelly time peanut butter jelly time it s peanut butter jelly time peanut butter jelly time peanut butter jelly time peanut butter jelly time it s peanut butter jelly time peanut butter jelly time peanut butter jelly time peanut butter jelly time this is what i expect most of the douchenozzles and their accompanying dirty vaginaed amigas have on an endless thousanddecibelloop inside their peabrains as they lean like eurocholos here at loco patron never really acknowledging each other until the battle call jagershots jagershots jagershots is signaled to the witless congregation first as a question then as an affirming statement and finally a rallying yell like a slowclapprogression in a john hughes movie if this is you take your hand and slap some sense into yourself you are annoying the piss out of me as i stand there drinking my shitty beer in a crappy version of mexican chili s i ve been to a ton of lame bars lrb ha bar its a restaurant tools rrb around these parts and those parts and boyo this one sweeps the major categories food garbage crowd warped service autistic atmosphere kill me overall experience alqaeda
i went there after work for dinner and i was the only customer lrb red flag i should ve taken a clue from the empty parking lot rrb after trying out several pho joints in phoenix this place does not rank anywhere at all sorry the soup was sweet and the bbq spring rolls were small thin and tasteless i ca nt help but compare this place to da vang miles down the road that place is constantly busy and when you see alot of asians eat there you know the food is good and authentic
not much food for pork belly was all fat no flavor
i like the products but the store is not very well run cashers were yelling at eachother tons of clients in line and very very slow transaction times i like the stuff but i think i will find online from now on
i felt so tricked after trying this place out i read about it on azcentralcom and decided to give it a try since it got rave reviews i was super eager because it is actually on my side of town for once there are practically no indian eateries in chandler my friend and i arrived on a friday night the first thing that greeted us upon our entering  a table of about eight monks all decked out like the ones you see in chinese action movies silent around a table i kid you not when we walked in they all craned their heads to look at us unblinking i wondered if it was some kind of aesthetic effect the owners were going for add to that creepiness was the fact that no one else was in the restaurant on a friday night i did nt see any staffers walking around we were at this point very uncomfortable and were actually backing out the door when a woman emerged from the back she caught us  we were trapped so we took a table i ordered a chicken marsala dish and my friend only ordered their dessert because their prices were ridiculously high when our orders came out i was kinda shocked at how small the portions were considering what they wanted us to pay so i eagerly dug into my meal  and almost spit the chicken out it was mushy and tasteless the sauce seem to consist of water and hmmm let s see more water  it was such a disappointing experience i have nt been back since the only plus  the owner was really nice and pleasant i just kinda suspect that they have a korean person back there attempting indian cuisine
booked this hotel because of a local softball tournament and the price seemed pretty good but i should have known better you get what you pay for our first night of three we were put in a room that had a loud air conditioning drip the kind that gets louder and louder when you try to sleep we drove from san diego so we were too tired to complain the second night it got worse so we did complain and they moved us to another room where they used industrial strength febreze to cover the dirty smell of the room and it smelled like a cheap men s cologne  drenched on everything so after a sneezing attack and asthma onset we moved to another room that was ten times worse if you have any allergies ask them not to spray this chemical in your room finally after sitting in the lobby with all our luggage for an hour they gave us a clean room without all the chemicals but the bathroom was lacking one important amenity no light fixtures above the sink only a heat lamp over the toilet so if you do nt mind not seeing yourself while shaving or putting on makeup its an average room to say the least good luck
i had a terrible experience at this shop  the owner is rude  my work was not done on time  i was yelled at and accused of having an expensive handbag  she ordered me to pay in advance  i think she is a nut  she did not call me to tel lme my dress would not be ready  it wa a special occasion stay away
this place is gross tasteless food and cheap filabertos blows this place out of the water my friend and i both had upset stomachs i do nt understand these other reviews these people do nt know there mexican food it is also a tiny box place with tables and half of them are not clean
this location is the worst in all of beautiful  merica we have used the drive thru on separate occasions in a period of months when we first moved to this neighborhood every time they forgot items for our order or gave us completely wrong food called a couple times to give em some feedback without being rude it has been years now since they screwed up our last order because we do nt go there anymore this taco bellkfc is a mile from our house but we much rather drive miles further and visit the other locations
average pizza pretty greasy though i put several napkins over my two slices to mop up the grease the worst thing about this place is the manager he has a lousy attitude and is quite rude i do nt think i ll ever go back
the food here is like a worse version of arby s waste of money
went to fatburger with our family tonight and will not return average food the burgers were average the lettuce was wilted the tomato was green and nothing outstanding about the flavor i d say better options nearby are joe s farm grill innout or culvers cleanliness was average the floor was a little sticky and the beverage area was kept very neat the kitchen appeared clean service was below averagehorrible the cashier was very unpleasant we all ordered at the same time and the first half of the food came out about minutes prior to the nd part it was pretty slow by the time we got the fries they were cold the staff literally acted like they were a bunch of highschoolers who were annoyed that there were any customers who interrupted their hangout i know this sounds harsh it is my experience was absolutely horrible we will not be back and i do nt recommend that you should either
i m not sure how i was so mistaken about how great a restaurant was when the premise is you boil the main course of meat to eat it mmmmm delicious boiled meat has been said by no one ever we used to love the melting pot in nc before moving here going to this restaurant was an event and you knew you would be dropping some serious to eat there when i saw the living social deal for for it seemed like a no brainer and a fun evening out boy was i wrong to me for says they are going to give me a credit for the tab of whatever i order for a tab that can be close to this seemed like a deal so i bought it i was surprised when we arrived and was given a prefixed living social menu instead of a credit on whatever we would like this i also noticed came with smaller portion sizes than what the regular menu came with so they limit what i can order but expect me to tip on whatever the full amount would have been without a credit  we upgraded some of our choices knowing it would be more expensive but it still did nt make for an enjoyable evening the locations in nc are set up so no booth is right across from another booth they are kind of staggered for privacy here felt like we were eating at tgi fridays the couple that was set directly across from us had requested a more private table that could not be accommodated and they made a scene uncomfortable to say the least and not the date night i had in mind you better be a fan of garlic to eat here because aside from the dessert it s in every choice of every course and something about a plate of raw meat and seafood being set down in front of you with instructions of how long to let it cook as in  if it walks boil two minutes if it swims boil a minute and  is less than appetizing our total bill came to lrb before the credit or tip rrb and we left disappointed vowing to never return our living social deal also listed we would be given a complimentary champagne toast which we were not even offered i get that we purchased a coupon but should nt be limited to a certain menu or treated any differently from other patrons in the restaurant this place was not worth the hours we spent there deal or not
yeah the food here is nt all that bad i d give the food stars by itself but service  shit restaurant  shit normally you get what you pay for but the prices here are a fucking insane on my last visit i paid somewhere around dollars for a cheesesteak fries and drink and slice of pizza the girl at the counter told me a price after i asked her roughly what the total would be lrb told me all that would be about bucks rrb and after ringing up the total it was around ok when asked what i wanted on it i asked for wiz but light on it a few people working there laughed at me hey fuckers were not in philly were in the desert some of us do nt like that much on the sandwich a guy making my sandwich spills some steak on the counter picks it up with his fingers and puts it back on the sandwich nice he gives me a what is your problem look another lady working there spent the entire time lrb waiting in line ordering waiting for food and eating rrb looking at her cell phone anyway the food is awesome worth trying if you do nt mind the price tag sitting in the restaurant to eat itself is cramped i was lucky enough to get a seat at the bar that is crooked my drink falls over i try to clean it up but there is a line of people standing around me i give up the condiment bar looks like a dog gnawed a ton of shit together and left it there i could nt tell what was what they were out of ketchup i did nt even bother telling them i will agree that the food here does resemble what you get in philly lrb minus the pizza stay away from that came out cold told them they did nothing rrb but hardly worth putting up with the fucking service there if i wanted to be treated like shit i ll go to work but i m not paying for it  updated as of   lowering to one star decided to give this place a try again and they pissed me off ordered two slices of pizza before a st patricks day adventure ordered to a guy who told me to wait a second as he was checking his cell phone for about two minutes what the fuck  took my order and i waited drunk college girls came in after me lrb bear in mind this was around p m rrb and gave my food to them because they ordered the same thing i wait again longer he flirts with them i ask him about my food he is checking his cell phone i hear employees at the soda fountain saying we are nt going to have enough fucking ice tonight as they asked the cook for a kitchen knife to cut ice bags open cook take the knife back after it is it used for cutting open ice bags and dropped two times on the floor and hands it back to the cook i only was able to observe this because i spent the better part of minutes waiting for my food with nothing else to do he cuts bread with it without washing it lovely since they forgot about my order so john q cashregister could forget about mine and give it away to try and hook up with college girl customer my pizza slices were only warmed up for about seconds the center was cold a few bites into it i throw the rest in the garbage and the napkin dispenser is out i tell the guy but he is too obsessed with getting pussy f this place i hope the owner of this place reads this
i enjoyed the traders joes in ca but his one on bell rd sells rotten food shopped their twice in the past two weeks and had to throw out the rotten chicken and another time the apples
the end is near went for one last hurrah before closing love westroc and their products but the thrill is gone from tv
very surprised but the margarita pizza had absolutely no taste not sure if that is normal for that type of pizza but we did nt taste the sauce the cheese  and did wait by the door for awhile before someone acknowledged us so did nt like that we came because we had a groupon coupon but not if we ll come back when we re used to grimaldi
the staff was nice but they gave me a procedure lrb vitamin d testing rrb which they did not tell me was not apart of the appointment or warn me that insurance does not cover this procedure i was nailed with an unexpected bill for this secondly i found out later that this test should nt be given to healthy women in their s because it is not necessary so then why did they give it to me in the first place  lastly it took me almost two weeks of numerous phone calls before i was able to discuss this billing issue with the office manager which they were unable to help me out in anyway with this unnecessary bill i will not be returning to this practice again
so it s no surprise to me to find this has closed with management so inattentive to customers and obviously not business savvy it s no surprise another statistic added to the number of failed startups no great loss here
do not waste your money time or energy coming here no seriously stop it do nt even think about it okay if you must do nt do any of the tours it s nothing you really ca nt figure out on your own and at least then it s free the tripletour lrb the train the mine tour and funhouse rrb were buying two tours is  so if you want to do all three it sounds like a good deal i know nothing about this area and i could have given a better tour than these toothless backwards and racist rednecks rrb the train tour  took them about minutes before they acknowledged i even wanted to buy a ticket i m sorry  can you smell my feminist liberalism from nyc  rrb the train was cute but was not educational at all the guy was kind of an asshole and know it all by not telling you anything at all then wanted tips rrb the mine tour was not fun at all the tour guide was terrible and an idiot my personal favorite was when he started to slam president obama look i could give a shit what your political leanings are and you have every right to dislike the president but i could give a rat s ass what you think when you voted for bush twice moving right along he says i ll move if he s reelected good luck in mexico  you hate mexicans and canada is far more socially liberal like i said good luck but i guarantee in he ll still be there if he s still alive asshole by the way that s the only thing i retained on that stupid tour not worth time money or energy rrb the mystery house was kind of cool i guess but again the guy was a real dickweed is there a dickweed gene in phoenix that has yet to be identified  because there is a huge sample set at least in the people i met rrb everything else was kind of nondescript if you have a lot of time to kill and you re in phoenix trust me take the extra two hours total in round trip travel and go to sedona for better pictures vibes and jeep tours do nt do it ps i thought a ghost town would be eerier i did nt get that feeling at all it was kind of hokey and dumb
i m from new mexico so when i heard of gill s being a new mexican restaurant i was excited to try it when i first walked in i noticed that there was no one there but me and my guest which raised a question in my head i asked my friend wow do you think no ones here because it s not a good place to eat since it was around lunch hour i thought it would be busier we went ahead and sat down started off with a nice waiter and burnt hard greasy extra salty chips they were gross i stopped eating the chips and ordered the green chile chicken enchiladas and my friend ordered the red beef burrito the food took sooo long being that we were the only ones there i think we should of gotten our meal a lot faster i guess gill is the only cook back there i dug into my enchiladas and tasted nothing good they were so bland and had absolutely no taste i also found bones in my first bite and more on my second bite from the chicken i then stopped eating them and tasted the beans which were just ok and the rice which was probably the best thing on my plate but still gave the rice a out of i then tasted my friends red chile ground beef burrito and it tasted like a mix of chile powder and water which is not new mexico style so i asked the waiter if i could please have a chile relleno which is my favorite food and i love all chile rellenos and thought to myself i could nt go wrong with my second choice boy was i wrong the chile pepper was hard as if it had never been roasted and peeled as they should be and it barely had any egg batter on it and to top it off it super greasy yuc what a disappointment this restaurant is an embarrassment to the people that are from nm because gill s taste of taos is nothing close to real new mexican food new mexico food is amazingly delicious and this place is a joke if they think they re making new mexico food it was the worst food i ve had since i was a child and my mom would make me eat creamed corn as a kid just as bad
i m surprised this kfctaco bell has no reviews nevertheless this location in my opinion is the worst ever i used to use the drivethru but after an incorrect order almost every time i ve found it easier to just go inside but then even when ordering inside orders are still wrong the food is the same as all the other kfcs and taco bells but the staff is what brings this place down tonight they were out of chicken out of chicken well out of extra crispy and even what they did have was not enough to fill an piece meal without mixing original  extra crispy that s fine okay i ll take it but then i observed as the employee preparing my order grabbed a bunch of individual sized containers of cole slaw and dumped them into a larger container for my order what  oh well it s still yummy it just seems like this spot needs to be organized and trained a little more why do i return  because it is convenient and the closest kfc to home
i have been seeing dr reddy for the past years she is a wonderful caring knowledgable doctor unfortunately her support staff does not mirror her qualities there is a horrible lack in customer service anytime i ve ever needed to call for an appt lab results prescription refills rescheduling etc i ve always had to leave a message at the main location i never once recieved a call back in the same day most times it was  days later most recently i had to leave messages over the course of a week before i was finally given a call back the time prior to that i finally gave up on waiting for a call back and went into the office to make my schedule changes i have never been to an appt to see dr reddy where i did nt have to wait anywhere between min   hours lab appts were always on time i did get an opportunity to express my concerns today to someone in the phoenix office re call backs she apologized and told me it was due to a software update which is the same reason i was given over a month ago for a lack of a call back re wait times she said that was the doctors fault she had no control over that i m completely fed up and am now on the hunt for a new doctor if dr reddy ever leaves this practice i would be more than thrilled to return to her care
i think this is now operating under the name francis and sons regardless you can pay for a better wash but you ll still only get the basic then when you go back to ask about the additional services you paid for but did nt get you ll get glares save your money do nt go here
i wish i could review their food but i ca nt why you ask  because my party never got seated my friend rayna was nice to give this place stars but i ca nt even do that i was so disppointed by the whole experience especially since i was looking forward to my first tapas experience ever i was over the moon excited but the service was such a let down i do nt think i would ever give it a second chance i am not trying to be ms whinypants here i understand the whole sitting with others at the table concept when my two friends and i showed up for my friend s birthday party we were greeted right away we said that we had a party of and they will be there in less than minutes the hostess explained that we could sit at the bar and wait but she could nt seat us until our whole party arrived she did point out that there was seating for people and she was going to reserve it for us but she could nt hold it until the whole party arrived well while we were waiting a couple walked in and asked to be seated there were other places for them to be seated but she chose to seat them at our reserved spot after that while we were still standing there she ignored us did nt explain to us that she had to seat them there or anything we were just completely ignored even when she noticed that another person in our party arrived an explanation would have been nice we thought it was unprofessional and lost the customer service appeal altogher we felt like she chose people or so we left and decided to have a fantasic experience at barrio cafe review coming soon
i bought one of those specials on living social for oil changes for in one year turns out is was some kind of coupon card that had the oil changes and a few other coupons like free engine light diagnostic etc when buying the coupon i had to select a location so i chose this one because of its location and sunday hours after receiving it i saw it also valid at a big o location further east i will definitely be using that other location for my next oil change since i will never return to this one the first time i arrived on a sunday around noon and was told they were nt scheduling any more oil changes that day so i asked for an appointment the following sunday and was told they do nt schedule appointments for oil changes and that i should be there as soon as they open frustrated i returned the following sunday when they opened only to discover i was already th in line for service i was told it would be  hours and was asked if i wanted to stay but of course i had no choice really since i had already paid for these oil changes it took about hours so i was happy it was closer to the beginning of the wait estimate and not the latter and left feeling like at the least i got my oil change later that evening i am heading to the store and notice oil dripping on my driveway of course by now they are closed and i had to be at work the next day my husband got under the car after getting home from work and found that they had nt tightened the drain plug it was put in and finger twisted lightly but they never went back and tightened it all the way over the next couple months i notice off and on an oil leak but since i was having other issues with my car lrb radiator etc rrb i did nt think a whole lot of it however when my husband went to work on my car last week he discovered oil all over the filter it looks light they had screwed it in there crooked and had been leaking as well but the real kicker was that he also discovered my low oil sensor was unplugged now i ca nt say for certain that they unplugged it when they were working on my car but given the crappy work they performed on a simple oil change i ca nt help but wonder after reading the other review about the broken antenna i am even more suspicious either way it was a rushed crappy job not even worth the paid with the coupon i wo nt trust them with another oil change let alone any larger repair in the future
after checking with the front desk on how to find the rooms odd on this side and even on that side  then ac in only one room lrb we had a suite rrb  the one bedroom did nt have a tv plus the tv lrb living room rrb was an older style the refrigerator was nt on so now we put our stuff in the freezer we are glad we are only here for the weekend and will not return to this one  lrb also keep your shoes on total black feet lrb carpet needs a good shampoo rrb the breakfast was good but needs to be restocked earlier also the keys did nt work  the front desk was nt too helpful plus the pool is nt hrs but at in the morning people were swimming if you stay here which id advise you dont  stay away from pool side
great lunch specials but they add a gratuity of their choosing to togo orders and will not remove it shady as hell wo nt be back
do nt like i ask for spicy not a jar of red chili pepper one person wating on tables you think about how quick you get serve
if i could give stars i would if i had the energy i would rate every ra in the country this thank you to the muslims for inventing the as a concept this place is completely cliched lame and annoying oh did i mention the sushi is sub par the service usually sucks since they must only require an iq of to work here yes billy the fork is the thing with the four prongs on it  new waiter proceeds to bring said fork to table  you can go to so many better places for sushi in phoenix going here is only cool if you want to leave partly deaf even their happy hour is weak abra  anthing but ra
this place is horrible we were staying right around the corner from here and were starving after the giants spring training game and decided to come here one of the worst decisions ever we came here at about pm on saint patrick s day and all we wanted was some food we got seated right away on the upstairs patio our waitress came over very quickly and asked what we wanted to drink we ordered waters and a beer it took damn minutes to get just our waters minutes after that the single beer my dad ordered came our waitress came back at about lrb minutes after we sat down rrb to take our order i ordered chicken strips and my dad ordered a caesar salad could not be an easier order right  wrong it was almost oclock before our food came my fries were cold my chicken strips were gross and frozen pieces of crap thrown in to a deep fryer and tossed on my plate my dad s salad was just as disappointing i understand it was saint patrick s day and the service might have been a little bit slower because of the crowd but my waitress did not even wait on the people in the bar nor did they serve food in the bar so the suckyness and slowness had nothing to do with that this place sucks a
this place is now renamed super moon but i do nt think i ll be making a trip to find out if it is any better the buffet was definitely huge with a ton of different foods on it the chinese food had sauces on the side lrb you could pour sweet and sour sauce on the chicken rrb but the chicken was rubbery other buffet items like chicken nuggets mac and cheese jello and pudding were available the sushi looked decent but i did not try it because i was not sure how long it had been sitting out the salad bar was loaded with half wilted lettuce there were other bland items too but nothing about this place stood out except for its high price with all the great restaurants in the area i would never go back
i first tried ono hawaiian bbq about years ago when it opened in north scottsdale it was the first time i had ever been served anything in a restaurant that looked so gross and tasted so bad that i walked out swearing i would never eat there again and i did nt until last week a coworker wanted to try it out against my better judgment i said sure i will try it again i am sure it has improved in the past years i ordered the chicken katsu to go with rice and macaroni salad when i got back to the office and opened my to go container i was shocked to see near raw chicken it was totally pink throughout the the breading not even being cooked all the way how do you screw up a fried piece of chicken that is pounded out super thin breaded and fried  my coworker thought maybe it was just the dark meet that made it look pink so she tried a big bite and immediately gagged it up since it was slimy going down once you pay for the meal and a drink lrb at a pop rrb you are looking at  a person i would rather eat at chili s for that price in the end i will say the rice is good from ono hawaiian bbq the mac salad is also not too bad although a little heavy on the mayosauce they use
it drives me crazy how many of my friends are tricked into going to this dump i hate this bar if i wanted to pay scottsdale prices for drinks i would go to scottsdale i know its crazy oh  i have to pay cover to get into a bar in tempe ha what a joke people please stop being duped into going here the only people who should be going to this pit are kids for their power hour or people taking their parents out to drink when they are in town cuz your mom would like it
i ca nt believe that anyone would give this dental practice a good review i would give them negative stars if i could they are a bunch of scam artists my husband and i went there just for a simple cleaning we were stuck there for hours  i am not kidding  we were there at am and left at pm we wasted our vacation days on this loser and i did not even get my teeth cleaned it was like being at a car dealership where they wo nt let you leave  they just kept trying to sell me k and my husband k of dental work we have been going to the dentist every months for most of our lives  our teeth are not in the terrible condition that we were being told they were and i just got the bill for over for items that we did not ask for do nt go to this guy unless you have a lot of money and plenty of time to waste i am researching where i can go to complain about this practice  board of licensing  better business bureau  i have never had such a bad experience with a so called healthcare provider
if your are looking for any kind of flavor in your food this is not the place for you i had a green chili burro with rice and beans it had to be one of the most bland meals i have ever had this the place for those out of towners you know the ones from those cold states who are not familiar with what mexican food should taste like i have to say it is edible you probably wo nt die but definately not enjoyable tasteful flavorful or memorable this is not the place for true mexican food connoisseur as for the service it was average not anything special
i will never go to this specific restaurant again i have been to this location for dinner about  times the last time i was there the service was horrible we waited minutes for someone to come by and take our drink order then we wait minutes to cash out do nt go here go to the one on mill ave instead
over rated dreck its about time we call a spade a spade come on people its a mediocre burger joint with not a lot of options the fries do nt hold heat at all and are good for the first seconds and anytime after that they are basically cold mushy potato chips the burgers are alright but go to dairy queen and get the mushroom swiss burger or the flame thrower at dq if you are looking for a fast burger oh yeah the shakes are foamy crap the ones i have had were barely chilled and gross the animal fries my wife gets looks like someone threw up all over a plate of fries no thanks
very bad experience dr boor treated me like a drug attic i had surgery on my lower back a few years ago and my disc are bulged out causing the jelly substance to hit my siatic nerve that runs down my leg very very painful feeling i havnt needed or have taken any psin pills since my surgery but having some pain right now he perscribed me some pain pills that made me itch really bad i called them to tell them i needed something different cause the prescription he gave me made me itch to bad he made me take those back to his office in order to pick up a new perscription i asked well how do i get my money back because i had to pay for them thru the pharmacy they told me i was just out that money he would nt give me another perscription without me turning them in so i did and he then prescribed me a lower dosage pill those did not work either so i started taking two instead of one every six hours i was nt about to call him to tell him those wernt working because i lost my money with the first set of pills so i go get another perscription from him because i was nt going to have enough pain pills to take me through the weekend and he told me if i did nt take them as he perscribed he would nt write me any other perscription i told him if he had read my file he would have seen the milligram he perscribed were a lower dosage and it was noted in my chart that they did nt work so he needed to perscribe something that worked and i would nt have to double up on them i have never been treated or felt so embarrassed to receive treatment from a dr before i will not be going back to him and would not recommend him to anyone
not the best or even average i ordered take out from here and just finished eating right now i got the crab puffs which had been highly reviewed from a fellow yelper i was very disappointed yes they were large but not filled with crab or anything tastey just filled with cold cream cheese my entree much in the same it was cheap chicken that was oversalted i think that the chef must be a smoker because he obviously can not taste the salt content in his food the place was pretty full so i m guessing some of their dishes must be alright or people would nt eat there i dont think ill be going back anytime soon or ever at all next time ill just go to panda express across the street its alot cheaper
what a dissapointment this place turned out to be new years eve seemed like a race to the finish line reservations for and after appetizers entree s and a bottle of wine with a second ordered we were all but escourted to the bar to finish our wine it was yes minutes of fine dining what a joke the food was overdone lrb prepared before we even ordered rrb and the service was like speed dating i will never return to this wanna be great resteraunt oh and when the waiter realized a mistake on the bill lrb after we had paid and retired to the bar so he could quickly turn yet another table rrb he came racing up to us to apologize for his oversite yes he needed more money or it would come out of his tip i should have told him to slow down and maybe he would nt forget to charge for items ordered again i will never return to this chaotic joke of a restaurant when there are so many wonderful places to dine save your money lrb yes our bill was over rrb and enjoy yourself somewhere else
men walking around with a smile on their face saying please shoot me i hate my life the women hanging on there mans arm with a smile on her face cause she has him trapped in her living hell with their beastly children running around driving every other patron of the place nuts while mom  dad ignore them yeah let s go shopping for cheap clothes and home goods made in a third world country by an eight year old child or let s eat a place that you can eat at anywhere in the usa and not taste a drop of seasoning
the customer service is absolutely terrible i have been there times now giving it a fair chance and each time the employees were rude i went tonight to try and redeem a groupon and they said that they did not accept it and that groupon had made a mistake there were no exceptions not how a small business should be run i will not be back
the worst public golf i ve ever experienced in the many years i ve been golfing with friends we were approached on the nd hole on a saturday morning and told that we had to play readyball it was nt that busy so no need at all to be interrupted and hassled on several holes the only reason my game got slowed down was because this steve guy was watching us lrb distracting us rrb on every hole and asking for our receipts twice steve later on apologized but when i told him i wanted a refund he never did anything we had to skip the putting portion on several holes to get him off out backs i did nt get what i paid for
horrible only two waiters ran out of meat  too expensive had to get up and get our own coffeejuice if i could take stars away i would save your time and money  eat at home or mcdonalds
i was nt going to post a review but after a followup phone call from this company i felt like i had to first of all their sales tactics are not ethical lrb at least in my opinion rrb initially they have someone canvasing the streets collecting water samples saying they re from arizona environmental progress  making it sound like a state agency they take a sample of your water and go and test it for you so far not really a problem then they come out with their sales pitch after i continue to explain to the salesperson that we really do nt have to go through all the demonstrations because i know i have hard water and i know what soft water can do the salesperson continues to go through her sales pitch ok so at this point i m mildly annoyed but still not really a problem at the end she starts to break down the cost of the system lrb over k rrb for their patented process fair warning the chemistry of turning hard water into soft water is not a secret a patent might exist for part of the system but most systems will do the same thing to your water so what are you paying for  a lifetime warranty and a ton of cleaning chemicals  that they also sell keep in mind the lifetime warranty is only on the components that wo nt wear out  everything else lrb valves timers etc rrb is not covered so then she starts pitching the direct marketing price of around but in order to get that price i have to make the decision that day zero time to put their claims to the test look up reviews on their company and system price out competitors etc i explain that this is a huge red flag the sales lady then tried to tell me that it would be a lack of integrity to promise a price that ends that day and then provide the same price at a later date i explain to her that it is a lack of integrity ethics and faith in your product to not allow a customer time to do any research prior to making a major purchase like this so as she collects her things i look them up on the better business bureau so despite the fact that she and her company boasted about their bbb rating they have more customer complaints on their website than praise same on yelp for that matter i explain this to her and she says that anyone lrb their competitors rrb can go on their and make a complaint i explain to her that anyone lrb her company rrb can likewise go on their and make praise so at this point i ve decided not to purchase their system mainly because after actual research i found a better system for about a third of their direct marketing price i figured i would just let the whole thing go that is until i received a followup phone call from their company the lady on the phone started nice asking how the sales meeting went i started to explain that i was nt a huge fan of their sales tactics lrb with the neighborhood canvasser direct marketing etc rrb she just starts talking over me telling me that the initial person handed out a paper specifically stating she was nt with a government entity lrb no such paper was given to me rrb actually telling me that the arizona attorney general prevents them from offering the direct marketing price past the day of the sales pitch i called bs right away and as i m attempting to explain to her just how full of it she was she continued to talk over me i was actually being very calm reasonable and honest as she just kept getting louder and louder eventually i just told her if she did nt want my feedback she should nt ask for it and then hung up the phone frankly their sales tactics are deceptive they are not customer friendly and they are incapable of having rational conversations even on the phone there are better water softening systems in the valley that are a fraction of the price that include up to year warranties on every part of the system if you want some advice take a pass on this company
wow what happened  the place was great the first time around the upkeep is horrible my booth had a bad stench you know that dirty rag smell the sushi is such low quality the food did nt look fresh at all i did nt even want to try the ice cream it was so messy i do nt think i ll be coming back here again
the worst ever our food was cold and tasteless it was our daughters graduation from law school of us and the restaurant was not busy all of our food was served cold obviously it had sat in the kitchen we sent back two meals and they brought tasteless pasta dishes kept the two expensive meals on the bill and left the table with our dirty dishes sitting in front of us for o minutes once we were not happy our server disappeared as did the other staff due to our daughters tears when we complained as it was her choice of restaurant and she felt responsible we let it go and paid our bill i wrote them after and have gotten no response from them do not waste your money at this restaurant
guys the fries what are you going to do about the soggy fries  customers are looking for hot crispy fries and you continue to fail in that delivery it really takes away from the excellent burgers you serve up
very unspectacular food there are so many other fantastic mexican restaurants to go to i would pass this one up chips average from the bag variety salsa sitting out all day on the tables how fresh is that  hot salsa in a plastic squeeze bottle that s all that needs to be said refried beans bland tostada average bean burrito average i know that s a lot of beans but again i ve had some pretty tasty refried beans and this place does nt cut the mustard i spent after tax and tip for a item combo and a coke it s not worth it and you re not paying for any atmosphere either
tellers dont know their products or policies i went into lobby to confirm that my paycheck debit card lrb bofa rrb has no feeas i heard mult views that they charge a fee to use debit teller said let s try it  then you will know for future just tell me if there is a fee then i can use the atm tellers passed my card around giggling like a jokewaste fo time teller had to call policy as i waited to find out if it was real scanned my license wrote up a cash advance he never told me if there is a fee this bank does not train their people no cs skills no sorry for the wait i may close my actual bofa acct is the usa declining in ethics and iq s  seems so
ok i liked this place when it had coffee and i like the murals on the walls outside but the whole preachy whiny and bettercooler than you vibe is really a turn off i would normally not review a local mom and pop type place badly but i was walking by and there was a jogger passing this place and the people at conspire made fun of him yelled at him teased him and laughed and him as he ran by what a bunch of jerks i understand that this is not the business owners but this is the type of atmosphere they have created supported and invited jeez i m taking my money where the people are nt mean not to mention the constant whining by a female there that says she s one of the owners hey i just wanted to buy something and support a local business i do nt need to know how badly you are being treated by your neighbors it s your problem deal with it
i had great costumer service with the girl behind the counter however the manager was horrible maybe he was having a bad day but he did nt even look at my face when i asked to substitute an ingredient he just said no i just wanted slices of avocado instead of cheese lrb i am allergic to dairy rrb  yeah i was nt asking for much here the girl even thought he was talking to himself or something and she asked him again and he said another no he said i had to pay for it lrb which i gladly did cause i do nt mind paying c rrb but he kept looking over the girl s shoulder to make sure she charged me then asked her again did you charge her for the avocado  omg i do nt mind paying he treated me as if i were stealing avocados and he treated the girl as if she was going to lrb god forbid rrb forget to charge me c horrible for a chain to have a manager like that i felt so bad that i decided to walk back to the hotel to eat there instead of eating in the restaurant
whenever i get my food  it s cold i do nt know why i ever go there  i keep hoping it ll turn around  like the others this is expressly a frosties only location for me
 okay i am sooooo sick of the crappy music they play at la fitness it s nothing but hiphop garbage junk the crowd that goes there goes right along with the music very  thuggy i always wear my ipod when i work out anyway waaay better music
visited aprox pm friday  an employee was mopping the whole floor with something similar to pinesol glad we were nt trying to eat inside gave my wife a headache my wife s salmon was overcooked as were the gyoza lrb potstickers rrb the salmon was supposed to come with tempura the receipt was correct but no tempura we were already home when she discovered that the arizona bowl was mostly white rice with a little fake lrb  rrb crab on top if you order to go check the order before you leave we will not return
the guy at the counter made me break a dollar to pay the penny when i pumped this jerk made me sound like one of those janitor s with the huge key rings with all the change in my pocket because he would nt let me slide on one red cent total douche
bought two groupons for the driving range  was just notified that this location is now closed and that i could be given a refund i have been to this driving range in the past and was impressed but for it closing down after buying a package  that s a one star in my book rip fiddlesticks until the next chapter
i really want to like this place but i always have a bad feeling about it the old lady that works there is really rude i have had a bad experience with this place and i refuse to go back i have to warn everyone about using their credit cards there
went to bacon for breakfast on  and man i should have stayed in bed this place has no business being open why  because of the following rrb this is just another trendy restaurant that is run by people who want to make money and not provide go food and service that exceeds the customers expectations rrb incompetent management and waitstaff who where not full of smiles but rather full of excuses as to why our damn food had not arrived in an hour after waiting a half an hour for a table rrb if you think that the food here is worth waiting for then you are glutten for punishment denny s is better than bacon i mean when i looked at my food as it arrived an hour later my first thought was man i wish i was going through mcdonald s drive thru for a sausage mcmuffin it made my mouth water instead i had to deal with what was thrown on my hurried plate a few cold eggs with bone dry bacon and where was the damn toast i ordered i mean this is not a free meal lrb though it should be rrb because it was free of any taste imagination or flavor rrb instead of taking responsibility for their mismanagement the managers and servers think that customers want to hear excuses like we did nt expect it to be this busy or the kitchen is a bit overwhelmed what that is your problem bacon paying customers just want to have their food as promised if you ca nt deliver on that then get the he ll out of the restaurant business food is not a child s game you ca nt screw with peoples appetites and then be flippant about it and not expect us to respond with an ear full i could go on and on however anyone considering this place at anytime be warned read these reviews i wish that i had and i would not have gone to this faux eatery which is a step below cracker barrel bacon owners if you read this my gut and eyes tell me that your restaurant is on borrowed time and wo nt last another six months once people are onto your business model which is poor service and tasteless food at a kings ransom in this economy the only thing in bacon s future is foreclosure where it belongs my hope and desire is that when you people shut done your empty restaurant and are left standing and scratching your heads that you will take a moment to reflect on your service failure and then watch how mcdonald s who will by now have taken over your location gets food out in a timely manner bacon your days are numbered and you cook staff sucks college kids with tat s and piercings not in my food and certainly not on my dollar take a pass on this place truly not worth it they specialize in bad food and bad excuses and not much else zero stars would be generous here
let me begin by saying that i have been to macaroni grills in other parts of the country and have always had a good experience what a letdown this location turned out to be my husband and i decided to try the two for twentyfive promotion lrb you choose tapas and two entrees from a limited menu fro rrb when we arrived it took a few minutes for the staff to acknowledge us not a good sign we were seated behind a family whose children proceeded to sing hum yell and kick the back of the booth lrb not the restaurant s fault but highly annoying rrb the waiter immediately told us that the kitchen was out of one of the tapas we had planned on ordering we made another choice and proceeded to order our main courses also ten minutes later our waiter returned to inform us that the kitchen just ran out of the entree i d chosen grrrrr again i made another selection our food arrived and my husband s chicken milanese was barely edible the chicken had been pounded and flattened so much that it took up the entire plate you could almost read a newspaper through it or use it as a frisbee lrb your choice rrb it was tough as nails and the only flavor it had was that of the grease it was cooked in my second choice entree  chicken caprese  was super bland but cooked well we agreed that the simple pomodoro that was served with my dinner and the roasted potatoes accompanying my husband s were far better than the actual entrees the area we were seated in was close to the back so we were treated to the staff yelling at each other across the dining area at random intervals there was no shift manager in sight at least none who cared enough to come by our table and ask how everything was needless to say we wo nt be back to this location
lipstick on a pig nice atmosphere attractive staff but being cute only goes so far in life and in the restaurant industry i gave the bartender lrb marissa i think  rrb a second chance after she was a snob on my first visit strike two and majerle s is out getting conversation out of the barstaff is like pulling teeth unless you have a popped collar and a jersey shore tan exactly what a bar should not be
i was looking into gyms around the area upon entering i was greeted by the front desk guy i asked about memberships and then he said sorry we are sold out i stood there stunned then he snickered just kidding trying to be a good sport i went with it next came the young sales guy he was personable  at first anyways showed me around the gym and i was interested in joining next we went over to the childcare area since i have a little one children were in the room however the two girls monitoring the room were chatting it up with one another and ignoring the kids bad sign i asked the girls if they were cpr certified and had fingerprinting and background checks the world stopped for just a moment and they stared at me i had interrupted their important conversation then they were both saying yeah like well um no i mean yes in other words no straight answers we sat at the sales guy s desk and the wheeling and dealing began i felt like i was purchasing a new car if you choose option a you then can go to all the gyms if you choose option b then only here the whole time i could see the children s area and the kids were being completely ignored lrb and we are talking very little children rrb when i told the sales man i needed to think about it he switched into some type of dr jekyll mr hyde routine well you only have today to make a decision after that no price guarantee from there he was down right rude i walked out of there thinking what the heck just happened like sarah g i felt horrible when i left this gym it was an awful experience ended up getting a membership at tangible fitness on th street they do nt have the same amenities however it is locally owned and the people are very nice there
this yelp is for the oishisa sushi spot today i purchased spicy mango roll with tuna i thought it might be a nice treat for lunch but it turned out to be a possible early death sentence because the tuna was spoiled so i had to spit it out bleep you oishisa bleep you bleeping wally mart quality bleep you and i called them to let them know
even though most subway s i have gone to have the same food this one stands apart on the service it is horrible the female owner is rude and should never own a business she mumbles when you talk to her and there is never a smile on her face her attitude rubs off on her workers as well
wow went there for the first time friday thought it was good until today when my friend sees they added onto his tab tipped the tender each time a drink was purchased he has all the receipts and it was way less than what they charged him so if you enjoy being robbed this is the place for you never returning
i ve been to prestige four to five times in the past six months and each time i ve been really disappointed the last time i dropped my clothes off there was the end of july and i ve since switched to mark s cleaners on shea lrb fantastic rrb really do nt go here  there are way better options in the area i m not really sure what the draw of this place is at first i thought it was price and convenience because that s what kept me from trying other businesses they do have your stuff done super fast lrb if you drop off before am it s after pm same day rrb and since they charged me about item and this was the cheaper option i had researched i did nt want to find out what the bill would be at other businesses with a known higher price tag  think z s cleaners i just figured prestige was the only place i could afford in the area since i get my stuff dry cleaned every month or so i even tried to use their printout coupons when i remembered however my clothes were becoming increasingly worn out looking this was a major red flag for me not supposed to happen with dry cleaning right  the last straw i had one brand new shirt come back looking as though i had put it through the washing machine i was frustrated because it was the first time dry cleaning this item and they charged me around for it lrb just a tshirt but somehow the fabric ca nt be washed because it has a sheen to it rrb anyway i finally was too fed up to go back and felt like there had to be somewhere else that would nt cost me a fortune and did a great job i was even willing to go to z s and just pay the price because i felt my clothes were getting ruined and did nt feel clean thanks to yelp i came across mark s on shea they restored my worn out clothes in one visit and charged me half the price i dropped my clothes off at am and they were done the next day after pm anyway do nt use prestige your clothes and wallet will thank you
okay i am now climbing on the overpriced bandwagon and i think teavana s white teas lack body texture creaminess  as i have shifted to white tea teavana s pricing is much too high compared to harney  son s teas i was shocked that i paid rd of teavana s oz pricing to buy a hot tea in order to sample their lavendar blend bucks for a cup of tea  are you kidding me  i could swallow th of the oz price so i am done w  teavana i really like the harney s mutan white peach and mutan white and am waiting for their jasmine pearls and white earl grey i am getting away w  using my harney white tea satchets for cup brews not bad that drives their price even further down harney s website httpwwwharneycomindexcfm heh
my guy and i wanted to eat at a japanese restaurant but was closed on sundays we settled with chase s diner because it was near by and open our waitress lrb ca nt remember her name lauren maybe  rrb was extremely polite and gave great customer service there were a few problems with our visit my guy and i thought their prices were a little overpriced for what kind of food it was grilled cheese for  it was nt tasty or high quality second my chicken was ice cold in the center i sent my food back to have it remade as we waited my date had a shocked look on his face he mouthed out to me there was a cricket crawling on the back of my seat i turned around and saw it was inches away from me i quickly ordered my food togo because i did nt want to be at such an awful place our waitress did nt charge us for my dish and we went on our way i noticed they did nt give me any of my sides i went home hungry and i probably will never go back to chase s diner lauren you are too good for that place i hope you find a better place to work at where your work ethics at appreciated
make sure that when you order a cake from this place you get what your ordered recently attended a wedding in tempe whose wedding cake was supplied by slice i did not have the heart to tell the young bride that it was the worst red velvet cake i ve ever had the misfortune to eat i happened to be near the cake table when it was brought it and was amazed at how unfriendly and dour the cake chef was she was not very positive or outgoing and i truly hope she is not the face of this company maybe she does nt think she needs the business but you never know who you will meet especially at a wedding and it might behoove you to be nice to the folks who may be your potential next customer fast forward to the cake it had a gold fleurdelis design which was uneven double shaded and blotchy it looked as though someone s hands were shaking when they stenciled the design on and they did nt have time or common sense to re do i am not a cake decorator but should nt the designs be crisp and smudge free  all of that might be forgiven if the cake was good but it was not i am surprised to read that this joint is a food network challenge winner i ve eaten at many places that sport this sign but have to tell you that imho many times that seems to be the death toll for these companies maybe the fame goes to their head maybe they ca nt handle all the business that comes their way but perhaps slice should retire the banner for awhile the cake was horribly dry tasteless and just plain old sad as the other reviewer said how you can f ck up a red velvet cake so badly is beyond me i swear the red velvet from costco is times better and no i do nt work for them many people left their cake on the plate maybe it s time to go back and recheck your recipe or maybe not make the cake so far ahead of time that it s dryer than death valley o  yuck double yuck one star for yuck
did anyone read my post about the roaches in the kitchen  wow   i will say it again there are roaches in the kitchen sick
i rue this place loath it despise it scowl whenever i think of my experience here i d give this place or negative stars if i could sure i can see how people would enjoy the low key atmosphere and the camaraderie of friends at a bar in scottsdale that s not the least bit pretentious it s not the bar per se that i have a problem with  it s the absurd activities during the week lrb of course giligin s has made its name based on its weekly events rrb ok so i can laugh about a midget bartender just like everyone else can that s funny sure a midget stripper pole also funny scantily clad women handing out free shots  eh that does nt even faze me nowadays it s not even the goldfish races that bother me i guess it s the man in charge on the evening i went lewd crude obscene disrespectful sure some people may like this but i definitely do nt i do nt want to hear a string of curse words coming out of a man holding a fishing pole with a dildo attached to the end i do nt want to see him waving it around in people s faces i sure as hell do nt want to see the end of the fishing line smack into a woman s face and the man laugh uproariously calling the female all kinds of names and insinuating she likes it you call this amusement  this is fun  this is entertainment  no this is bs when you have to humiliate and degrade people to have a laugh then you need to reconsider how you spend your downtime ok so maybe i m coming off a bit strong here it just riles me up to think people actually enjoy going out to be humiliated and talked down to like they re scum it annoys me to know a man is employed to be a complete and utter jackass and on top of that the crowd urges him on while getting rapaciously sloshed i will never go back here i want nothing to do with a place like this in fact i feel sort of bad for anyone who likes this place for the sheer fact that they can get a verbal beating by a dude with an iq lower than the goldfish he torments if that s your bag enjoy just leave me out of it
i was very excited to check this place out with a friend of mine it s always nice to have a new spot open up in the area you always hope that someone has finally done it right the unfortunate truth is that this place needs to be on the show called restaurant impossible i m not kidding when i say this go and see for yourself i have no animosity for this place it was just very disappointing to see a group of guys  young boys lrb ownersinvestors rrb standing around in their poor choice of wanna be club shirts that they probably got on sale at marshall s along with their poor hair grooming and unprofessional demeanor it was as if they felt that their machine was up and running and that no improvements or the customer experience was even a possibility of a real issue the bartender had a frown on his face the entire time and our waitresses were as friendly as can be but really need to be informed and educated on their brews i do not put this responsibility on the girls as much as i do the poor management now with my ranting aside my reasons for disappointment were as follows we ordered the brewer s choice plate which consisted of mortadella prosciutto and tuscan salami along with a choice of cheeses and a bunch of fillers that they included the plate came out and was presented well but right away the cuts of meat were a disappointment the thickness of the cuts was ridiculous and embarrassing the mortadella was almost room temperature which can actually be a health hazard prosciutto was some sort of cheap salt cured and hopefully presliced if they sliced it in house their chef should be fired for slicing such a thick cut of prosciutto even a nonchef knows that much the salami was certainly nothing special and again the mortadella was the biggest disappointment with this as my first impression of the food i was very turned off and do nt see them lasting very long if they do nt fix such simple but important things i suggest that they visit  the parlor and take a look at the quality of the artisan meats that they serve on their carving board along with the thickness and temp of the meats there is no comparison and this is a no brainer for even a foodie much less a chef or a business that was swarming with inexperienced management at the time so the next item was the meat and potato flatbread with pork belly and three cheeses i will say that it was mediocre but missing some element of flavor to make it complete the chips and guacamole were simple but no complaints there i enjoyed the yucca chips i am not trying to be an extreme hater but this place has a ton of hype out there and they are nt delivering quality products or service they need to turn it up and light a fire under the asses of these young guys that are looking at a high profit margin by sacrificing quality food they will need to offer much higher quality products if they want to stay afloat i wish them the best and would love to try them again if i hear that they got everything straightened out this would be an ideal location and they have a great concept cheers and good luck guys constructive criticisms are all i am offering and wish you the best rrb
somebody close this restaurant down does nt matter how good the food is because the atmosphere is concentrationcampish and the staff are like nazi prison guards
i used to love this place but in the last year the place has totally run down its product quality and its customer service my last three orders have all had mistakes and were late in delivery when i called to have the situation remedied all i got was a credit on a future order wtf  you ca nt get it right the last three times and you think i am going to keep coming back  get real not only have you lost what was a regular customer i will see to it my friends no longer patronize your establishment either
i love chompies i really do just stay far far away from this place on sunday morning  afternoon the place is incredibly understaffed table for with a baby told us it would take minutes to sit it took more like we sit down we wait minutes no waitress a table next to us get s seated they get greeted get their drinks then get their food order taken then the same waitress comes over and takes our order so now we ve waited minutes to be sat and minutes to have a waitress come to our table i ask for scrambled egg to come for the baby as soon as it s ready minutes later a manager comes to the table with our egg it s undercooked and cold very mushy you would think being the manager he s qualified to take a look at a scrambled egg and know this is undercooked it was quite obvious i send it back minutes later our food comes out still no egg i ask the food runner she comes back with an egg that cooked fine but freezing cold on a very hot plate lrb a very tell sign that these eggs have been sitting under a heat lamp for minutes rrb if the egg was for me i would have sent it back but it s for a baby and i would have cooled it down before i fed him the food was great but never saw our waitress again after she took our food order if we wanted water or extra napkins i got up and got it myself this is nt my first rodeo my wife had her baby shower here on a sunday and we got the same crappy service i need to remind myself to stop coming here on sundays
i absolutely hate this mcdonalds it has the most incompetent slow employees ever almost every time i go there to get a soda and iced coffee or something to eat with my kids it is an agonizing process whether in the drive thru or in the restaurant i try to avoid this location even though it is blocks from my house this location has been this way for at least years no hope for it changing any time soon
this place is closed and there is a for sale sign in the window just when i was going to try this place
only out of complete frustration and numerous attempts to give these guys a chance i finally give in and tell the sad facts i work in the same building as spoonz i liked the silver spoon and looked forward to a local establishment opening in the building i waited for what seemed like an eternity for the doors to open  for months lrb and months and months rrb past the opening november sign doors finally opened i think it was spring i was excited to visit first visit was coffee hand crafted coffee drinks they advertise i ordered a vanilla latte the quiche in the case looked amazing odered it as well went back upstairs to my office ready to enjoy alas no the latte was watery and gross tossed it the quiche was nt warmed lrb reheated rrb through and was a total letdown in taste tossed it i gave them some time to get settled  they were new they deserve a chance to get their groove i went back another latte and a bagel breakfast sandwich the bagel sandwich was bad the latte had since improved but still was nt good i called and complianed this time i want you guys to be awesome you are convenient and local i love that the worker came and dug my sandwich out of the trash after that call i guess they wanted to see for themselves what i was dissatisfied with she apologized and promised to make it up to me the ownermanager contacted me later she was great again i want this place to succeed under her encouragement i gave them a couple more chances the food got better the service was decent but the food still was nt good just ok they need to learn to not boil their chicken to death and properly cut it so you are nt tearing tough boiled chicken flesh with your teeth when trying to enjoy the scottsdale lrb all other factors of that sandwich work rrb  the coffee is still just ok the sweet potato fries are excellent although i went today to get the fries and ordered a tuna melt lrb first try wo nt get that again ciabatta is too tough on a panini press rrb when they handed me the bag i specifically asked is the chipolte mayo in there for the fries  yes they assured me take the bag back to my office and excitedly dive in to the bag  no mayo i went back downstairs frustrated got mayo i might have had smoke coming out of my ears sorry to spoonz cafe i keep giving you chances i want you to be awesome i am glad other yelpers have found you satisfying but you could be so much better  you were so much better in your other location i write this in the hopes you improve your quality control make a consistent latte for what you charge for sandwiches improve the the ingredients you have great ideas and a great spot but consistency and quality lacks and good luck to others who decide to give this place a try
garbage food the food was not worth eating yes they are generous but the flavor is not good almost every item on the happy hour list is a california roll with something on it and the california roll was a lot of yucky we decided not to eat about worth sushi and take it to go the dog ate it the next morning i might go back just to taste the nigiri but will only start by ordering one
i spontaneously went to china city super buffet with the intention of trying something new ironically the experience that i received was far from what i was looking for after finding this location in the hood i was promptly seated and went for my first tour of the buffet after discovering that the first plate was not clean i grabbed another and loaded up on some sushi it was nt great sushi but it was nt bad either it just did nt taste that fresh on my second trip i grabbed some mixed rice orange chicken beef and some cooked shrimp lrb with the head on rrb everything was quite lukewarm fortunately i was still using the chopsticks that i used for my sushi as i picked my way through the rice then i found the special surprise of the day in my rice an insect leg now i ll gladly admit that i m not an expert when it comes to bugs i ve seen plenty in my day from cockroaches to bees and even crickets so i ca nt say for sure which kind of insect that this leg came from but i am absolutely sure that it did nt belong in my food after discreetly taking pictures i called for the manager and showed her the evidence she tried to act like the twojointed leg was a black thread as she held it up to her black shirt good try lady  i may look dumb but i am not stupid long story short i will not return and only recommend this place if you are really open to wanting any kind of extra protein in your diet two photos of the leg are attached for your viewing pleasure
i really wanted to like this place at first i thought maybe i went on an off day nope i tried shopping here for a week it just feels cheap like i am shopping at a crappy cent store small selection of products i personally ca nt trust the produce from here most of it is nt refrigerated there were flies all over the place on a high note the meat here is beautiful which confuses me with the produce being subpar oh sad face emoticon
i tried to rent the meeting rooms  for a th birthday event i sent an email to beverly someone she emailed me back a week later asking for my phone number again i gave it to her no response then i called and left a message no response i called again a week later no call back for days she told me she would check and see if the rooms were available for the days i needed and get back to me within hours no call back ever this place has terrible customer service and no way would i ever go there again
i ordered the eggs rancheros the tortillas were home made but not properly cooked as they were doughy and really thick my friend had the chicken quesadilla the chicken was hard as a rock due to being over cooked the only thing that was good were our mimosas do not recommend this place
went here to try the place out lets just say i will not only never be back but i will be telling the world to avoid this place we waited for mins to be seated as i stood there and waited i watched the manager seat all of her friends who came in well after us if your jewish you will probably love this place because its very apparent you get preferential seating i finally went and asked why we have nt been seated yet and there were about people after me on the list who were already eating after we got seated the waitress seemed in a horrible mood and made a bad experience even worse the food wasnt horrible but also not good the people who work here seemed so confused and clueless on how to run a restaurant my advice go to mcdonalds and get better service also they wont penalize you if your name is nt goldman
i have come here time and time again trying to find something to like about making the semispecial trip here i wish i could i do not think my expectations are all that high but maybe i am off base they do make a decent latte but my driving force coming here were their minicakescupcakes which are no longer offered with the change in bakers they still do offere the tart but not the cupcake i do not understand but i suppose it is not my place to thoes cupcakes had a delicious sweetness that my tummy craved on a regular basis no luck in getting them anymore i will stick to my usual lrb yes local rrb coffee house which does not require a special trip for much of the same
this place sucks i do nt know why people are saying this is the best pizza in downtown they must have had their taste buds removed at some point in their lives so i ate here for breakfast one day and had a bad experience i ordered the breakfast burrito and it was supposed to include salsa it did nt have any in it so i had to go back and nicely ask for a side of it the owner then became angry and started to yell at me and say that he serves customers a day lrb not sure why that was relevant nor do i believe its true rrb i said i just liked salsa and that it says salsa is included on the menu he proceeded to argue with me for some time he tried to tell me how it was already in the burrito lrb it was nt rrb and that white people do nt like salsa so he does nt put a lot in clearly this guy is an idiot eventually the guy gives me salsa when i looked at it it was some form of pico de gallo i had to then mix hot sauce with it to get something closer to salsa i understand people make mistakes and forget things in your order sometimes but in the end its how you handle it the owner was argumentative uncooperative and rude take your business elsewhere
usairways  i do nt think so scooter they do nt even deserve to have us in their name because first of all it s not about us it s about them secondly they are a disgrace and an embarassment to this country where should i start  i was going a mere air lrb land rrb miles to durango co from san diego ca with a connecting flight in phoenix after boarding the plane they inform us there is a machanical problem with the auxillary power unit lrb a common problem on the old pos airbus planes rrb and they would have to manually start the engines on the ground not sure what this meant i was nervous and frantically googling on my iphone to make sure the plane was safe to fly without it fortunately it was but unfortunately for all of us low passengers waiting to take off we had no air circulation in the cabin until after the plane took off because that s one of the many things the apu does for the plane bump crunch grind bump crunch grind those were the sounds the plane was making while they fired up the engines i seriously thought i was going to die then once the engines got fired up the plane was making a wierd clicking sound as we taxied on the runway and even as we were taking off this really made me nervous everyone was joking that the clicking was the sound of them manually winding the crank up so the plane could take off i gotta give props to the pilot he made up for the delays and got us into phoenix on time but the flight crew was just eh not too friendly they all kinda looked like they hated their jobs everything costs money on this airline it s bucks for water or a soda bucks for a beer or a cocktail if you want an aisle or window seat or else they smack you in the middle seat by the way that choice seat fee is per connection so if you want an aisle seat on all of your flights lrb say you have connections rrb that s not then i paid to check my bag so all total my round trip to fly miles ended up costing me but that s not all if you act now you ll also have your return flight to san diego canceled in phoenix yes folks they canceled all flights out of phoenix to san diego at pm last night because there was fog at the airport in san diego the worst part is that they made us wait for hours before telling us our flight was canceled i could have been half way to san diego by car then everyone was asking if they ca nt just fly to orange county or lax lrb which we heard from other people in the airport did not have any fog rrb and they abruptly told us no so what happens when your us airways flight gets canceled  nothing you get to sleep at the airport all night long and then beg pleed and pray that they can find you a flight out in the morning they do nt put you up in a hotel they merely offer you a discounted negotiated rate at a local hotel they did nt offer to compensate they did nt communicate to us what would happen to our bags i heard from another guy who talked to the lady at the counter that they told him there were no flights available until tomorrow night which means i would have been flying back to san diego on new years eve assuming they did nt get fogged in so what did i do  i rented a car at hertz total cost was lrb ouch one way rentals are expensive rrb but i decided if i m going to be driving to san diego at pm at night i better have a comfy car so i upgraded to the cts for more which was well worth it in the grand scheme of things i made record time and was home in bed by am on tank of gas lrb and people diss american cars but i m here to tell ya horsepower tank of gas miles amazing rrb now i m waiting to hear about my bags desperate and afraid of how long it might take i m also hoping they will refund me for my flight but i doubt that s going to happen will update the review after i see how they treat me after the fact needless to say i know flight cancellations in san diego are rare but i just do nt think i can trust my life with this airline ever again with their old worn out planes nickel and diming you to death with fees and hey wait a second is nt gas lower then it s been in years and yet the airlines are still charging us all these fees and higher fares 
normally i would nt criticize free food but with the food these guys provided i ll make an exception they catered a thanksgiving event at arizona state university which was free to students although i m sure asu had to pay the vegetables and stuffing were all overcooked into mush the broccoli was overcooked not just to being mush but was in fact browned it was also unseasoned the carrots while mushy at least had some seasoning on them i m guessing they used up all the salt on what resembled turkey breast slices the oversalted turkey was mystery meat of the chicken mcnugget type the high point was the brownies which were pretty darn good  rrb to be honest i would nt go to any event with the draw of them catering with food my girlfriend also said they catered once where she works and characterized the food as  cafeteria style slop edible but not worth paying for 
i was in the store for minutes and no one acknowledged i was there no hello when i came in and no one asked if i needed help i was the only customer in the store and there were employees the only thing any of them said to me was the total cost for my stuff and then sign here two of the employees were watching the game on tv and the other two were having a personal conversation while they were ringing up my stuff i was treated as if my shopping in the store was an inconvenience to them stay away i ll stick to the play it again greenway instead
i do nt get why everyone loves this restaurant maybe the drinks are strong for a reason  the food is ordinary although reasonably priced however i have been to the restaurant twice and both times had shoddy service the first time the restaurant was extremely busy so i could understand the last time i was there with colleagues for lunch two of us shared entrees two of my friends discussed with each other that they would also order a salad and share it but asked the server not to split the salad as there is a fee for doing so and they did nt need two plates instead the server did split the salad so they were charged for splitting both the entree and the salad then we found a hair in the hamburger we had split after almost eating all of it by that time the server was so slow that we had run out of time for deserrt had to return to work and did nt even have time to discuss the hair in our food it took forever for the server to come and pick up the payment for our check so i took it up to the bartender explaining that we were late getting to work and wanted to take care of it i was rebuffed and told that the server had to take it he did not try to help me locate the server so i waited some more i will not return to this restaurant again
do not go here i rate them with one star only because you can not select negative or zero stars i was referred here from discount tire for an alignment i arrived at am on a tuesday morning after numerous attempts to up sale me for brakes rotors and a diagnostic check i was finally back on the road with a tire balance and rotation at pm that s right no alignment and a three hour tire balance and rotation job the alignment did not get done as i was told at the end while i was paying because one of my heads are bent on my machine i received no other explanation or even a mention of another location that could complete what i went there to have done to add salt to the wound i leave the location and realize that i left my prescription oakley sunglasses in the lobby of the store i return to the store  minutes later and ask if i left my sunglasses there at this time a man comes out from the back with my glasses and jokingly says i was going to sell them to which i replied it appears so since no one came out to tell me i left them or called me to let me know this just solidified my experience and showed what kind of morals and ethics the employees really have do not go here for anything
never never never utilize this place for meds the pharmacy staff is completely useless meds never on time even though promised personal information sheet left on pick up counter for anyone to see or walk away with the joke of a pharmacy tech who could nt be bothered with you as she chats on personal calls in front of you instead of addressing your needs my experiences here have been so over the top negative that i had to pull my prescription out and contact both corporate as well as sankyo lrb the drug company that makes my one hypertensive medication rrb to complain about the myriad of issues including blatant hippa violations that were the norm for this location aside from the pharmacy a good deal of the staff seem to be very much on the tweaky side of the fence the store manager is pleasant enough but if he ca nt clean house of the current staff it would be in his best interest to get the hell out of that location
extremely disappointing i came by to this location for a return after purchasing a number of items at another store unfortunately either i went on a off day or this is generally how this store operates i went and there was only open register while there where five other employees just standing in the front not doing anything i was trying so hard to be very patient but seriously no motion no offer of the other employees to step up and open another register to help any other customers what a shame these employees are being paid to just stand there at least the standing decor has purpose versus the employees ouch not only that but no one greeted any of the customers very sad
worst tuna sandwich i ve ever had and i use tuna sandwich loosely in that i had to check to make sure there was actually tuna in the damn thing i do nt eat at subway often but when i do i order the same thing  tuna on italian with the works and theirs sucked i ll never step foot in this subway location again who wants to pay dollars for stale bread and a shit ton of lettuce 
i brought my macbook pro into these guys because it had become very unresponsive i really had to have it fixed asap so i figured i would drop it off with experts instead of wasting time trying to fix it myself big mistake when i dropped it off they said there was probably some issue with the hard drive they charge for a diagnosis which can go toward any repairs they took two days to look at it then called me and said there were a couple issues they said there were a couple minor issues with the hard drive which they said the fixed and then they said the other issue was that the plastic pieces which hold the second memory stick down were broken that what was creating the problem well i had a piece of material keeping the memory stick down using the pressure of the back panel but they said that it was unresponsive because the memory would still move around some and recommended that i just find something else to keep the memory down better they said they had fixed most of the unresponsiveness by fixing whatever issues they found with the hard drive though i said okay it sounded reasonable i turned it on when i got home and it was the exact same as when i brought it in still just as unresponsive what the heck  you had it for two days and did nt fix anything but tell me you fixed most of it  so i have most of my info backed up so i just decided to try to delete everything off of the hard drive and reinstall everything from my back up drive lrb in the shop i explained to them that my info was backed up and told them it was okay to do this if they needed to rrb well i did that and it fixed the issue guess i should have tried that before wasting the and lost two days bringing it in but seriously  you do nt try that in the two days you have it in the shop  one of the most simple fixes there probably is  i am no computer expert and i fix what they ca nt  these guys obviously do nt know what they re doing
i used to go here often when i went to mcc i admit that the food was pretty good but the owner ruined the entire experience for me at the time i was learning japanese and wanted to try it out in an actual setting he yelled at me the first time i tried and told me to speak english another instance and the real reason i do nt go back there is when a friend of mine went to eat there after he finished he said gochisousamadeshita lrb a polite saying thanking the preparer of the food for the meal rrb and the owner muttered under his breath henna gaijin lrb strange foreigner rrb i can understand not having the patience to speak japanese with me but really insulting someone who just thanked you for the food  that s enough for me to never return
the service was not great and my fiance was throwing up the food hours later also we did not get everything we ordered after we ate i told the waiter and instead of taking what we did not get off the bill lrb like i asked rrb he said it was ready and went and grabbed it and brought it out lrb by now we had finished eating and wanted to leave rrb
if you come here to eat breakfast because an old friend is in town for the day here s some advice  do nt service does nt even aspire toward bad in fact the service ranks so far down on the bad scale it ca nt be measured i t like that movie the abyss food was decent but nothing to make your shorts wet and you know those dollar sign symbols indicating how pricey the joint  well this place should have a small picture of warren buffet bill gates and mark zuckerberg gathered inside the bullion room at fort knox for some kind of ceremonial were rich bitches circle jerk prominently displayed somewhere on the menu this place not only sucks balls it does so with such tremendous wind tunnel force it swooshes them down whole where they lodge in the back of your throat jamming up your glottal stop preventing you from making the uhoh sound upon seeing your bill
i am a complete fish lover growing up that was my staple  fish all kinds of seafood octopus lobster crab i think you get the idea i had passed this place on the way home one night and vowed to see what it was about i checked out their website  not too shabby hubby and i decided to give it a go the other night what a disappointment i ca nt even articulate about how overcooked my food was or how meager the service was i practically begged for water and silverware words can not describe how angry i felt when i left the food the service utterly disappointing i ordered their cedar plank salmon the salmon was so overdone that the edges were past the point of crisp  they were burnt i asked our server if i could please get one that was not quite so charred i swear she rolled her eyes at me the sides were the only highlight of that meal hubby s meal was ok by his standards but i could see a stream of resentment building in him it was a thursday night not too packed but busy enough our server was more concerned with her chatter with the other servers it s one thing to have friends at work but you do nt neglect the customer i saw that we were not the only ones who bore the brunt of her bad service when my plate came back she slammed the dish down so hard that the salmon almost fell onto the table surly much  i ca nt give this place a good recommendation their beer selection was ho hum as was their mixed drinks not a place i would recommend for friends or out of towners
this store is no longer open i believe it went out of business in early
not a fan the gelato was ok at best and the bad thing was that they had costco muffins for sale ah that s not good at least be creative
we ve eaten here a few times over the years and never received a decent service but the most recent was the straw that broke the camel s back we initially wanted to eat a sushi a go go across the street but they were jammed without an open table at pm on a sunday so we decided to settle for stingray we walked in and the place was nearly empty the hostess was busy seating a family which was taking minutes for some reason so we decided to walk into the bar area we walked past the bartender and asked if we could take a seat at one of the tables he said sure no problem let me grab a server for you so we waited for five minutes with out any service while the bartender and servers casually chatted behind the bar so we decided to take our money and our appetites elsewhere when we were walking out they did nt even care they just said have a goodnight if i was management i would have fired someone on the spot
quality is awful service is worse
just tried tr with the family  again my ribeye came out too rare made several cuts to find a good piece they took it back to refire about min later i was given all my pieces back i would like to say it was good but looked too much like burnt dog food too scared to try i asked to have the meal removed and the waitress asked what was wrong with it i explained that it did not look too appetitising and her comment was is nt it the way you cut it up or did we do that after min my waiter came back with the check saying my manager took care of my meal would have been nice to see this manager before we left total time in the restaurant was hours
i decided to use city wide because of their lower price well i should have known better i was using another company for my pest control but thought i would give it a chance since i was trying to save a little cash one night inside my house i almost stepped on a scorpion and i never had problems with scorpions with the other company two days later i found yet another scorpion in my house i called city wide the next day and told them i found two scorpions in my house the customer rep was extremely rude and condescending with me she told me i could up my coverage but it would cost a lot more also they would charge me another fee on top of my monthly charge since they had just been out to my house to spray i do not recommend city wide and would suggest to seek other companies unless you want bugs critters and scorpions living with you in your house because city wide was not spraying the right stuff i m now behind the eight ball and dealing with a pest issue
typing this review from my phone as i sit at a different discount tire location for my services this morning i came in and worked with a guy named john who simply quoted me a price would nt come down without proof i found a better price already lrb said they already constantly check competitor websites to ensure they re best rrb and talked to me like i was an idiot for asking if i needed to replace all or could get by with i left and went to a different location who took the time to call and confirm i was telling the truth on the price i stated beat it and gave me a discount for the partial wear on of my tires john needs to call over and take lessons from mike at their sister location not that it matters for me i ll never be back to this location again
i have to say i have been there a few times before and had a blast this time it was was such a let down i took my kids thinking they would do what they are known for the show we got our soup  salad and in min the guy came to make out food no tricks no nothing he made the rice no flavor at all the steak and chicken was to dry we were there all for about min the manager gave me  off my bill not much at all i do nt like spending and not getting great service i will never be back over all the worst place i have been to in a long time
i have no idea how they ever received a star rating this place was below mediocre first of all it had a very distinct smell in the whole restaurant and it was not a very appetizing one that s for sure secondly the server only came by twice once to get our order and the second time to bring out the food she never bothered checking up on us or anything we actually had to flag someone else down just to get a refill the food was ok i ordered two blueberry pancakes with an egg and bacon as well as a half order of the biscuits and gravy the pancakes tasted as if they used a bisquick mix and tossed in some unripe blueberries which was very disappointing because i usually love pancakes out the biscuits and gravy on the other hand were much better but still not good enough to bring me back john had the country fried steak and gravy served with hashbrowns and eggs he said the country fried steak itself was nt bad but not his favorite the hashbrowns despite having them topped with cheese onions peppers and jalapenos were very bland and needed a good dash of salt overall you would be much more satisfied going to your neighborhood denny s than hoosier cafe in my opinion
sadly nothing has changed the fact is if your over and believe that service is important this is not the place for you huge place with approximately patrons and workers this time i went with people or couples we were seated and then forgotten we watched other kids who came in after us order and get drinks then place there food order it was obvious that we would have to get up and ask for a server after minutes we did wow we can order server asks us what we would like and we ask for the extensive beer menu which could have and should have been given to each person when we were seated he returns with one and stands there waiting for our order yes for people and wants an instant order so finally we order and in only minutes we get our drinks minus that he forgot but did return in minutes with the soft drinks our food order came out quicker than the drinks but interestingly the other kids who had come in after us were already done eating and gone chopped salad looked like i had asked my kids to make it we upgraded and ordered chicken to be added and found that it and some black olives were the only chopped item on the plate it was served with two tiny plastic cups of dressing hardly enough for the salad but it was fine with us as we did nt eat it mcdonalds would not have served this and perhaps the management should hop in their car and go to picazzo s and see a chopped salad pizzas came out and were average and on one there was no sign of sauce anywhere under the cheese perhaps they forgot it or there was so little it went onto slice well we would have loved to have had more drinks or refills but a table of girls came in and for minutes it became the only important thing for our server finally we gave up and one of us walked to the hostess and asked for our check about minutes later he arrived with the bill and just left it on the table in between all of our dirty plates glasses and silverware and walked away it was extremely hot the night we were in and every minutes a young guy wearing a camoflouge shirt or hat i do nt rememeber was adjusting the ac i am not sure he even worked there as everyone else has on black t s in my st review i suggested this restaurant would be struggling during the summer when they would have to count on locals for support people on a friday night might be a true indicator the manager asked me to come back in and give them another chance same result sorry mm but look up and down mill and see restaurant spaces empty because they assumed the kids of asu would support them and keep them in the green
anyone of obvious color have a good experience here  i went in twice both times with an open mind since this never happens to me both times i left feeling very uncomfortable it s important to note that i was with others who were not of color and they felt the same way first time i went was late evening during the week no patrons in the restaurant area only at the bar i was quickly told they were closing and were no longer serving food no drink was offered second time i went was around pm sunday afternoon same amount of customers this time i was served wings that were so obviously past their expiration i could nt even get one close to my face a less than sincere apology was offered but not alternatives for dining or drinking i m just putting it out there since i came to the yelp page hoping once again i could find someone who could prove what i think i experienced wrong i hate to think that goes on in the area i grew up in lrb but there is a theme to be observed in the parking lot with likeminded bumper stickers rrb just saying
this gas station makes me so angry i ve just seen one young man working there who is plenty nice unfortunately he is probably underpaid and he is made to wear a hideous polyester ampm shirt with candy brands on it but the real reason i hate this place is the car wash is broken often and when fixed somehow actually makes the car dirtier also i tried at three different pumps to get gas but they were all frozen at the debit card intake and i was told by the young man who works there that the sun makes them do this we are in arizona folks we can do better
see the huge sign outside that says  yeah that s for shirts only i was caught off guard when i brought in my skirt and got nailed for about as i sadly handed over my bill the lady at the counter said a lot of people had told her they felt betrayed by the sign outside no kidding i had originally been heading down the street to regal on th ave  who does a fine job in half the pickup time  for the advertised fake price here trying to make the best of it i told the lady at least i d learned they had an onsite alteration service and maybe that was worth a buck uh oh picked up my skirt a few weeks later with some jersey shoretype chick at the counter and was told i owed another i flatout refused to pay twice she screamed at me chased me to my car wrote down my license plate and said the police would be visiting niiiice
we did not have a good experience apparently there was only one server and one cook on the sunday afternoon that we visited the pub after waiting an hour for our food  an hour  the order was incorrect we were told it would be another minute wait if we wanted the order corrected because that s how long it would take to cook the fish unbelievable to their credit they did offer to comp our meal and we took them up on it however between the obvious disorganization of the place and its lack of handicap accessibility we wo nt be back
all baja fresh are not created equal i enjoy baja fresh in avondale scottsdale x  phx this one not so much i will not be back to this one there are just too many doing it right to be done so wrong again i got a a groupon  was so completely psyched because this meant a good deal on food i already have tried  enjoy so on a sunday at noon we hit this downtown location we have a church down town we frequent  a phx museum membership so we spend time  money down town on sunday s the burrito mexicano was dry  tasteless i think there was maybe a tbsp of pico on the whole thing my hubs ordered the baja burrito with his fave carnitas  the burrito swam in juices after the fist bite but was also lacking seasoning his burrito was a sog fest  could nt be put down or it would have sat in the juice  not been able to pick up again our son got his usual quesadilla  was nt disappointed in the least but come on it s melted cheese on a tortilla he s been making these in the microwave himself since he was not rocket science after the salsa was missing tomatoes  was very very thin tortilla chips cold  stale the girl at the register on said sunday am could nt even ring up the groupon the manager had to i m sure when they are staffed  business is bustling for lunch  lots of turn over this is just as good as any in the valley i frequent but do not attempt this place on a weekend one the hours really are nt conducive lrb close very early rrb  the food is left over from the week i m pretty sure just not good
i visited this store while i was on vacation and this was the worst buckle i ve been the sales people were very rude to me usually they are all around you trying to help you out and suggest thing but here they gave me dirty looks and did nt acknowledge me or my friend instead the girl helped out someone else i left immediately this has been the unfriendlyist store i ve been in some of the clothes are over priced too
i have never had such awful service in my life all of bartending staff were very very rude i will never go back
yuck would not eat here again the food is very bland and greasy the chicken tenders were low quality meat tables and drink bar were dirtyemployees just standing around grab yourself a bag of mcdonalds next time and you wo nt be sorry
this review is for cabela s restaurant i ate here twice twice it was very bad cafeteria food bummer you are better off hitting one of the surrounding restaurants lots of ok ones to choose from
i had the second and last of my bad return experiences at dillards at paradise valley yesterday i was returning a very expensive pair of blue jeans and was greeted by the rudest sales associate of all time the return policy is clear that you need either the sales receipt or the original tags i had purchased the jeans a week ago in houston and in the packing and unpacking process i had lost the tags the sales representative basically told me i was an idiot for not keeping the tags and tried to tell me she was going to give me or a pair of jeans that i had the sales receipt for i ve never in my life had such an awful return experience i got my money back but will never make the mistake of shopping at dillards ever again i hope they become a casualty of the down economy they do nt deserve to be in business
i was bit tentative to start but boba deli is close to my office and i wanted a quick lunch plus i like boba but boba alone could not tempt me to go back for starters i was disappointed with the menu the selection is expected but the display consists of pictures mounted several feet above eye level there were no descriptions of what was inside each sandwich or wrap and so impossible to tell what made a santa fe chicken wrap so santa fe the menu image showed something green that did nt look like lettuce or avocado so i asked if it was green chili i was looked at with pure disdain that could have come from either lack of knowledge about what green chili is or incomprehension of why anyone would want green chili on their food this lacking information quality and social receptivity was evident in every other aspect of my visit tho the latter concerned me the most when the girl who ordered before me asked if her smoothie had milk in it she was also treated with disdain when the girl indicated that because the smoothie had milk and she could not have that her order was voided and she left the staff member muttered inaudible negativities lrb based on body language and tone rrb all while completing the void and for several seconds before turning to me for my order shame on me for not promptly uturning out the door right then as others did i ordered paid and waited for my food my boba drink was ready first when i got it it was not the size i expected and i indicated that i thought i had ordered the large i did and that s what i got but it turns out they only have two sizes an ounce large and a ounce extra large what restaurant has only two sizes one of them an extra large without first having a small or medium or regular or some similar convention 
wow as i was going through my reviews i found that someone had deleted my review for over easy i thought they could not do that my whole review focused on the owner and how i saw him in line at safeway buying cheap store brand lunch meat huge packages of it and how he wears shorts and crocs i mean cmon buy some pants and real shoes you have some pretty bad reviews own up and stop buying safeway brand lunch meats some og your most loyal customers have not returned
my wife susan and i attended an andr rieu concert on tuesday june at the jobing com arena in glendale az the concert was well attended andr rieu and his orchestra performed magnificently we enjoyed the performance very much however the arena s concession charged outrageous prices including for a little ounce bottle of water to make matters worse we were nt permitted to leave the arena to obtain drinking water from elsewhere or for any other reason unless we were willing to forfeit our right to see the concert can you believe that  to read the entire review visit httplepetitprincedelasteroidbblogspotcom
this place is way over priced for regular breakfast food might as well go to denny s for half the price even the bacon lrb namesake rrb was not even thick cut bacon it was nt burnt i guess and why do they have hershey bags everywhere  i did nt see any chocolate on the menu oh and they have a strict lunch can only be ordered after lrb  rrb policy it was when we ordered that s pretty harsh
ever wonder what our country will look like in the future when mexico has successfully invaded our country and hispanic mexicans are the majority population  they will treat us white eyes like trash bump into us without regret and cut in front of us as if we did nt exist well there is a place you go to get that kind of futuristic treatment today arizona mills the place is in tempe arizona we were driving through arizona to get to san diego and my wife wanted to stop near there for the night and visit the mall bad decision this place never fired the first shot and has already won the war if you are ever in the area keep on driving
took my year old daughter there for lunch yesterday may and the food was absolute garbage i ordered half a chicken ceaser salad for bucks it was the size of a side salad and had pieces of thin sliced chicken in it each the size of a quarter my daughter and i jokingly put all of the chicken on a single fork this place sucks and is a total ripoff the way they scam you out of normal portions now too bad the old gm sherri is nt still working there she was cool and did nt go for this bs applebees on chandler you can lick my butthole
gross hot not good
it s an arby s food tastes like every other arby s however the service is consistently good and that s important when you re trying to cram a quick lunch within a half hour break so they get a few stars from me edit this outlet did nt honor their nationwide promotion of free curly fries after a matt kenseth nascar win the cashier did nt even know who matt kenseth is and made me feel like an idiot trying to collect on a dollar side item what the crap 
i have to find a new friend to go bike lrb schwinn not something cool like a harley rrb riding with this is the second time i have been dragged to a paradise bakery at breakfast time i ca nt take it anymore there was a review for another location where the reviewer says it looks when you step in the door that paradise has promise that is so true when you first walk in and are looking at the bagels the baked goods the menu the purple lights you almost forget about your last horrible experience have no fear once the food is served you quickly remember i ordered a croissant breakfast sandwich  no ham and a medium coffee seems simple enough they brought me the sandwich with ham i did nt know when i first bit into it this ham is still alive it is so tough i am sure this is what wilson rejects for their footballs what is wrong with you paradise  why would you stick a huge slab of tough ham inside a croissant a croissant that was nt even toasted which brings me to my next comment you stick an egg on a croissant and you make no attempt to toast the croissant  even dunkin donuts toasts the croissant you have no clue how to make anything even after panera acquired you they could nt impart any wisdom into you  and coming from panera that would be little wisdom since they have a terrible menu which you made worse it was good to taste the same bitter mud er coffee that panera serves paradise you owe me more money for this disgusting crap you served me but why ca nt you try to improve  you clearly ca nt think this food is good  you remind me of the fat girl in school who boys would tell her she had a cute face just to get some action out of her someone once lied to you and told you you had a cute face and you believed them the fat girl was fat and being used and you do nt have a cute face
awful like really awful prices are extremely overpriced for the products they have  as expensive as whole foods but not even organic the staff is very mean and definitely not afraid to yell at their customers the only thing that is good about the store is the organization of the products everything else stinks i will never go back to this store
i recently like just hung up from this store they will not take cabinates with out the doors attached i have a arcadia door with the frame sink and range hood lots of hardware and all the parts they have never seen it and turned me down for getting rid of them i was kinda disappointed as i used there store when i was remoldeling my kitchchen oh well check craigs list for a free door and cubbords sink and range hood
i went here once and then went back to try it again after entering and observing i realized that this was going to be the same exact underwhelming experience as the first time as a matter of fact they are pretty much a factory of that exact experience kind of annoying the food was salty really salty i ve had so much better mexican i do nt understand this place being successful here i can only imagine that it is because we have so many transplants here in az and they have trouble trying places they do nt recognize the name of its ok people there are real mexican s here who have been making food for years go to one of your local places check it out it will destroy this corporate blandness that has salt as its only spice you are on yelp you could look for a place near you a mexican place that only exists here in your town has no other locations miles away from mexico its ok to adventure out of what you know its actually why some of us are yelping so you can go to the places that are good not the ones that suck
my wife booked lyons roofing to come first thing on a friday morning so it would nt be too hot we were thinking about the worker and willing to get up early on a day off we received a confirmation email earlier in the week on friday morning i received a call from the worker stating he got tied up at his first job of the day and would nt be able to make it until later i said no problem i understand we ll be around all day so just let me know when you can make it even though i had other things to do i stayed at home waiting for the call back which never came that was one month ago today and we have never heard back from the company still looking for a roofing company but definitely would not recommend this one warning they were recommended on angie s list too
i regretably went here for my birthday last night ordered the ichi roll and got a death mayo alien roll this was the worst thing i have ever tasted rrb it had at least a handful of mayo blahh rrb it had a pound of crab that looked like redwhite spaghetti lrb soo gross rrb rrb had the texture of a raw pumpkin sliced in thin strings rrb tasted like licking an old fish we got the waitress to refund the sushi since it was unedible when she brought the bill it was not itemized and we could not figure out how it came to that much the entire time our waitress was never there never refilled our drinks we finally flagged her down to get a break down of the bill she came back with the same copy we asked a different person who grabbed her to help us she came to the table and asked do you have a problem with me  wtf we told her ignoring what she said can you just bring us a breakdown of the bill she came back again with an un itemized copy i would not have tipped her but on parties of  the add  gratuity which btw she added  without permission we were there for so long ad wanted to leave otherwise i would have disputed that tip charge in full you dont come up to customers and ask if they have a problem with you not only was the food the grossest shit ever the service can suck my ass
my advice is do not live by the basketball courts or in the a buildings lrb even though it s the cheapest area and there is a reason why it s cheap rrb i have lived here for almost ten months and all i can say is holly crap there is a lot of freakin kids my neighbors love to smoke pot and it sucks for people who do nt smoke kids are always crying in the middle of the night and running up and down the stairs teenagers are walking around in the middle of the night being loud there was a car with a busted window so do nt leave anything valuable in the car my neighbors down stairs are always fighting and i can hear the wife crying if you need to sleep in the day time forget about sleeping if you live in those apartments when we st saw the place they took us to the north part of the apartment which is nice and peaceful they then told us we were in the a building which turned out to be a freakin zoo kids are everywhere with no adult supervision and the children love to play chicken with the cars we almost hit some kids playing that game and we get paranoid when we come home so cheap apartment  ghetto and headaches pay extra money for a better place so you do nt have to worry about your car nor your sanity
if i could have given less than one star i would have i live in michigan and attempted to purchase a gift certificate for my sister in arizona i have visited blue wasabi many times and was a huge fan but due to this last experience i will never return i ordered a gift card over the phone well over weeks ago to be mailed to michigan so i could send it as a christmas gift my credit card was charged that very same day but the card still has not arrived i have called the restaurant several times and even spoken to the owner who replied with the phrase well i do nt know what you want me to tell you we do nt keep records of sales like this so hopefully you ll get it i was appalled that the owner of a business would be so rude and not care about someone spending money at his restaurant i have since filed fraudulent credit card charges with my credit card company so i wont have to pay for for this gift card that will never be arriving i will gladly be taking my business elsewhere where i am treated with respect and i suggest you do the same
yuck yuck yuck went here today during the tempe art fest today perhaps i should have been wary of the fact that while there were tons of people on the street very few of them were in coffee plantation and it was cold outside anyways went in waited in line lrb i was third but it took a while to get served rrb and ordered a latte no syrups nothing fancy just a latte minutes later after husband has gone outside gotten and eaten a hotdog and friend heather h has procured soba noodles i finally get my latte even though i was third in line then when i open the lid on said latte i am greeted by the fact that there is no foam while a latte is not super foamy this one literally had no foam husband and heather h said i should request a new one but i had no desire to wait another minutes then i made the mistake of drinking the latte it was awful and tasted burnt ugh i am all for supporting local businesses but they need to deserve it if you are on mill in tempe and want coffee do yourself a favor and bypass coffee plantation walk a few more blocks and go to starbucks
this clinic is owned by a different business that dictates the way they run their practice and the treatment recommendations they make you ll never get good news from any of the doctors and generally if your pet could have a very severe ailment or a mild one they will always lean toward the worst and generally recommend invasive procedures without testing for potential different causes furthermore coming from someone who has spent thousands with them in the past year alone they will do everything in their power to be a hindrance on saving you any money by refusing to fax your animals prescriptions to any online pharmacy which in turn forces you pay far more than necessary for prescriptions
i ve had this food twice once in restaurant once take out the first time i got garlic noodles and while they were good it just was nt flavorful enough plus over half the items on the plate were not meant to be eaten just for decoration looks like a lot of food but it really is nt maybe i was just really hungry the staff sucked i ve heard from numerous other people lrb who love and still frequent this place despite their staff rrb that yupha s has the best food just horrible service when the owner yupha is nt there it took forever to be seated when we lrb party of two rrb could see actual tables open just sitting there second visit was a complete and utter disaster i thought oh i ll try take out since i m by my self and everyone says that s the way to do it anyway i ordered the pad thai for dinner not realizing that i was looking at the lunch menu who would think their lunch pad thai and their dinner pad thai would be different  well they are i m a vegetarian and the lunch pad thai has tofu no meat well the dinner pad thai that i paid for and got home with had chicken and shrimp in it i called to see if they could cook me a new meal if i came back lrb which was already irritating considering i live minutes away minutes there minutes waiting minutes home minutes back minutes waiting minutes home this better be the best pad thai i ve ever had rrb but instead after explaining the situation the lady copped a major attitude with me and said ok so  i explained again i m a vegetarian i do nt eat meat what i have here has meat so i ca nt eat it her reply yeah we have options without meat and  i cried i paid dollars after everything was said and done for something i could nt eat i will take my business somewhere that understands what good customer service is by the way i ve worked years in the restaurant business and the last year i have been in retail so i have extensive customer service experience you should never treat someone like that
wow i could nt have been more disappointed with the food i am far from a picky eater but the burgers were bland and over priced lrb i have no problem paying even more if it taste good rrb service staff was great but the frozen style tasteless patties and fries were massively disappointing you could nt get me to eat here again if someone paid me
this is your warning do nt throw your money down the next toilet i have noooo problem labeling this the worst place the service food and coffee are all on the same level of terrible i live in the neighborhood and was very excited to try this awesome looking establishment st experience  i had already gotten a coffee earlier in the morning so i just needed breakfast and an excuse to check out the inside i decided on the breakfast burrito that the counter chick had recommended i paid with my cc and signed the receipt her happy go lucky attitude changed so quickly i thought a killer with a knife had walked in behind me then it hit me i did nt tip her omg is she really that mad  i thought she would just grab my burrito from the case and hand it to me i did nt get coffee so why tip  i thought it would be a second transaction well she made me wait minutes and i was the only one waiting i could nt believe it what a fantastical first experience that is when i decided nope not for me then i ate my burrito and it was the worst thing to hit these lips in quite some time it was horrible i would imagine having this in a hospital cafeteria i m not kidding bad about a month later i was looking for a place to study and meet up with a friend i decided to try next again it s soooo close and i had nt tried the coffee yet so why not i ordered a black and white mocha it was not good it reminded me of gas station coffee the kind you get on long ass road trips the kind you put your cup under hit the button and let go about  from the top my friend arrived about minutes before they closed and ordered a drip she went for a refill about minutes later but they had dumped all the coffee they had just had a convo with her they could nt have forgotten about the customer they just sold a drip to who might want a refill they were so worried about closing up and going home they had dumped everything and closed up minutes before closing time that is crazy to me i ca nt stand the service the food or the coffee at next it sucks because the space is amazing they just suck badly
one star just because the coffee and potatoes are good they use fake eggs that are not good and have poor portions for the money the veggies were cold on the top of the eggs and all around i m not impressed with the cleanliness or food
if you feel like waiting receiving poor service and over paying for food you should try this place the portions were small too small in fact we actually left there to go eat somewhere else we had a reservation and still waited minutes to be seated and it was only downhill from there it took min before our waiter even came over and greeted us and it was at least min before he came back to ask for our drink order the drinks were ok but overpriced when he finally made it back to take our dinner order we were starving i ordered the pasta and my boyfriend got the steak definitely not what either of us expected especially for the price we were paying his entree was small and would have left anyone wanting more while my pasta was slightly more filling i too was not satisfied we finished dinner feeling broke and hungry all those combined  not worth trying save your money time and appetite head next door to delux instead you ll be much happier you did
by the time i got seated lrb not at a table but at the bar in a group of so we could nt even talk to each other rrb after hours we were so wasted from drinking in the pen next door that any pizza would have been good i think they mask the averageness of their pizza by making sure you are drunk by the time you get to eat it overrated
this place sucks the idiot that wrote the glowing report about the bizzaro dr edgecomb must have been his mother he was nice but a real weirdo the arrogant and cold dr warfield is not nearly as smart as he thinks he is they actually refused to send me my test results because we do nt have a cent stamp in the file for your account and instead insisted i pick them up at their front desk fought with them for weeks over a balance that i had already paid in full doctors come and go very frequently here and there must be a good reason for it i suggest that every doctor their assistants at this practice read the hippocratic oath for the first time
if you have an asian fetish this might be your place the food is crap but the girls who work here wear next to nothing my server s skirt was short and every time she leaned to wipe down a table or bring food to the table you can see her tiny ass cheeks that alone is worth just the tip pun intended the menu looked very promising i see dishes that i do nt normally see offered at other vietnamese places like thit bo luc lac lrb which is seasoned and sauteed cubed beef served over a bed of iceberg lettuce and rice rrb banh canh lrb varieties of udon noodles rrb and even nem nuong lrb grilled pork patties rrb but one thing that they advertised was their bun bo hue lrb spicy beef noodle rrb i started with some goi cuon lrb spring rolls rrb and ordered the bun bo hue too the spring rolls were all lettuce and noodles there was a thin thin slice of pork and shrimp not the best but before i could finish half of my roll my noodles showed up already i asked for some siracha and the server grabbed the bottle from the table next to me where a single diner was waiting for his food i asked if they had another bottle because from the look on the other diner s face he was confused why it was taken from him she said that i should take what i need and give him back the bottle nice like pho a plate of veggies are provided but for this particular dish you get a plate of cabbage sprouts and thinly sliced banana leeks i knew the true test of this dish was the broth so before i added anything to it i sipped a bit of the broth and it totally missed the mark on the flavoring it was basically a bowl of salty water with a bit of annatto oil for coloring from that moment i knew my bun bo hue was a poser i tried the beef and it tasted boiled and added to the noodles instead of being stewed in the broth furthermore the piece of pork leg lrb a circular dissection of a pig s leg with skin and bone attached rrb was not clean i bit into it and could taste the stink i could not finish the bowl and did not care enough about the spring rolls to finish those either i know that my review of mylynn will fall onto deaf ears with the owner but i ca nt recommend this place as good vietnamese food and let my country s cuisine reputation be tarnished
dropped by this place cause i needed a quick bite and it was new to me well needless to say i ate and left i do nt even remember what i ate but it was food for sure  i think  okay gotta stop being mean let s just say it was nt anything new nothing i could nt have ordered say from rubio s or chipotle yo quero taco bells please lrb the place itself was decorated with some traditional mexican portraits and paintings in an industriallike setting kinda odd but whatever tickles your senses i guess  enjoy
do not go here have been going here for years and quality has gone way done now my diamond ring has been lost under some questionable circumstances and they are refusing to help me or look or do anything do nt let this happen to you
phoyuck this place i was tricked in to going here with promises of great vietnamese i was ready for a culinary adventure and what i got was a ride in the fright house the bnh xo was so greasy i could nt eat it it was literally served on a plate of grease the bun was about the same it lacked flavor the rice noodles were slimy the spring roll was loaded with grease i ordered some sort of plum soda drink and it had a cup of salt on the bottom of the glass the service was horrible and i will not be back
i give this one star only because the owner of the restaurant was considerate enough to hear my rant about his incompetent workers who could not for the life of me take down a simple one hamburger plus fries phone order an apology for my order would have apparently been too much instead i got a are you sure you called this location  ummm you have another location  i ve had better service at mcdonalds
poor service worse food one star because the beer was cold
i went here today with a my family that was in town the service was very bad it took a long long time to get the food and it was not busy at all the food itself is overpriced and unfortunately not worth the money or the wait this place needs to get its act together quick because it does not take close to one hour to prepare a sandwich
my bf and i decided to give this place a shot since we were craving bbq are poor students and saw what looked like a fantastic deal lrb summer dinner for for rrb woohoo obviously this is not a hip happening place for people in their s aside from a few babies dining with their grandparents we were the youngest people in the restaurant by a few decades and did i mention that it even smells old in here  like ripe kind of old the meal comes with an appetizer of fried onions and green peppers lrb crispy not soggy or greasy rrb choice of entrees each with sides and an apple pie a la mode for dessert for our entrees we ordered the allyoucaneat bbq beef ribs and some kind of meat combo of pulled pork bbq brisket and something else that i forgot for sides we got mashed potatoes clam chowder and corn on the cob where do i possibly begin  appetizer was fine the beef ribs  were kinda gamey tasting and full of fat hardly any meat the pulled pork was decent but the bbq brisket was so sweet the clam chowder tasted like it was from a can and the mashed potatoes tasted like it was from a box corn on the cob was mushy the saving grace was the pie  and it was nt even that fantastic and was missing a chunk of crust on one side our stomachs were filled when we left but needless to say not a happy kind of full gross and we did nt even get refills on our water boo
this is really not outlet shopping many of the stores have closed and are gone the remaining ones do not have any outlet pricing mgmt has built a new wing of high end shopping  bcbg j crew etc but they are definately not outlet they are high price so it is a misconception with the term outlet i believe what they are doing is to change to a high end shopping area and phase out the outlet concept waste of time especially dress barn and karen kane awful storeslousy people there do nt go
where s the beef  boston market on a friday night thought i d stop by for some quick comfort food before heading to the movies it was not busy but they way they handled everything you would have thought it was packed they must have some new employee issues because i got one taking my order i ordered a carver sandwich my child ordered mac and cheese of course it seemed to be a language barrier when i said brisket carver sandwich on wheat she repeated back to me three times insisting i do the combo ok maybe it only comes as a combo so i say yes she tells the cook half beef on white and i quickly correct her wheat please some sort of holdup and they say they will bring to it to the table for us we get our mac n cheese and drinks and sit a few minutes later the  carver arrived wrapped and ready togo no au jus for dipping no salad just a  sandwich she says i m sorry and realizes she forgot the rest of the order and quickly goes back to get the missing food the manager comes by and asks what is wrong as he is apologizing to every table he was the manager of i m sorry she comes back with the food and leaves the sandwich had small skinny pieces of beef on it that did not even cover the roll no swiss and no mayo the au jus was warm at best the salad was fine i was extremely disappointed in the carver sandwich for i do think there should be meat on the sandwich to be quite honest the last few times i have been to this location they are slipping it will be a few months before i go back if i ever go back the manager did bring me a one free corn muffin hint hint nice jester but dessert would have been better just very disappointed in the whole experience
sprinkles cupcakes is nothing special and it just goes to show marketing is everything the service is great and the presentation of the cupcakes is nice when you see the pretty cupcakes in their nice box you really think you are getting a gourmet cupcake like other bakeries the red velvet cupcake was just ok the carmel apple and cinnamon sugar cupcakes were muffins they were good but i was expecting a cupcake the chocolate vanilla with sprinkles was the best but nothing to write home about there are tons of great bakeries out there with amazing cupcakes i will never come back here and i hope one day more people see past all the gimics and realize sprinkles is just a fancy store selling over priced regular old cupcakes and muffins
i came here with my husband on a friday night and had high expectations from the other review here and from a few friends that had been however it was definitely one of the worst experiences that we have had at a restaurant once we were seated our waiter seemed very pretentious and almost put off by us everyone else in the restaurant seemed nice and friendly so maybe it was just bad luck we ordered the loaded potato skins and they were room temperature but would have been to die for had they been warm all the way through we had one left and asked him to box it for us then we ordered the pork sandwich and burger both were pretty good but the portions are huge so neither of us were even able to finish even half of our food when our waiter finally brought us our check he mumbled and i thought he had said something about boxing our food so i said yes please and he took our card and came back with the receipt i asked him if he would be coming back with our boxes and he said oh what and giggled oh my goodness i had no idea that you guys wanted that and it is in the trash i m sorry he did ask if he could get us something else to eat but we had other plans for the evening and did nt have time to wait normally i would say no biggie everyone makes mistakes but his overall attitude was bad from the get go and he was very insincere and did nt seem overly interested in trying to make things better i did love the decor and atmosphere and like i said everyone else there was very nice maybe we just got the rotten apple
the worst manipedi e  v  e  r paid for manipedi with french every single nail bubbled after i got home this was because the layers esp the top coat was gobbed on totally slimed big gooby mess when it finally dried it was a disaster i would have gone back for a redo but guess what  i was on my way to the airport had to get a redo lrb and repay rrb out of town cuz it was so awful of course i go back in today wks later discuss the situation with mangeremployeeowner lrb she changes her title to suit the situation rrb i said just a redo no charge she said pedicure too  of course i said yes well guess what  at the end she wanted to charge me in full same amount as last time i said calmly i knew this was going to happen it was your fault bad job got redone elsewhere she said i should have come back next day i said i already told u on entering the problem we had an agreement no serivces were rendeered last time  i paid in full this time i will walk out now my husband said we will pay a discounted price i said no such thing hubby ended up paying for a reg manipedi only minus the french lrb ooooo big deal rrb this ordeal ended up costing  for a mani pedi which normally is  anywhere else x s normal ca nt say you were nt warned with all the hundreds of choices out there no way i ll be back no idea why anyone else would pick it either
we always wanted to go this place due to the fact that many other hong kong chinese restaurants are really good and it seem like it was like a great authentic chinese food place to go to this is by far the worst place i have ever been i ordered the egg fu yung it came with patties just green onions on top and gravy no other vegetables or other condiments like i have at other places and worst of all it was burnt we ordered peking pork chops and it tasted like orange chicken try figure and last we ordered seafood chow fun it was slimy and seafood was chewy uncooked and no flavor what so ever the top it all off we were not offered any other drinks server just gave us water that tasted so bad due to the fact probably because the glass cups were not washed well as you could see other lip stains we all felt grossed out and sick after and my year old daughter was nauseated all the way home me and my wife had a headache as well probably because i presumed of the msg and uncooked seafood and the overcooked egg fu yung last it was degrees outside and i was sweating like a pig inside with there ceiling fans off and the ac prob seem like it was set at degrees first and last time at this place
alright i ve waited until i settled down before i wrote this it s about a new establishment that opened in surprise uptown alley my wife and i used to be in several bowling leagues and sponsored several teams then we moved to surprise i was excited when i heard about a bowling alley opening in surprise my daughter was celebrating her nd birthday we thought what a wonderful way to check out this new place first dinner at the red embers with a few cocktails opening presents with a few more cocktails a birthday cake and a few more cocktails followed by a few lines of bowling for the entire family lrb party of rrb and possibly having in a few more cocktails this ai nt gonna be no cheap date to make things easier and to add an element of surprise we decided to take the custom birthday cake we had made to the restaurant where we were to have dinner that way they could serve it for dessert surprise my daughter and really embarrass her with happy birthday we have done this several times at many restaurants my wife takes the cake to the restaurant and is told they ca nt accept it after a brief conversation she returns home and not very happy i call the restaurant ask for the manager and engage in a very long conversation i explain we re neighbors this is our first experience with their place it s my daughter s birthday etc she blames county regulations for this decision i inform her that every other establishment we have gone to with this has gladly accepted and served she stands on her denial based on county regs i inform her that my wife has several years in food and beverage management including many years at arrowhead country club and that no regulation exists she stands firm not to upset the daughters my wife and i continue as planned the food was okay mark our server was good i believe as an attempt to pacify our server comped a birthday brownie after dinner too little too late as for the bowling experience again soso too dark and too noisy ghetto boys in the lane next to us did not enhance the experience we had our grandchildren there and the language and actions from our neighbors was deplorable thanks for ruining a special day for our family
worst latte that i have ever had no foam all milk gross
i was driving by looking for a place for lunch and i stopped in hoping for some deli food i was quite surprised to see that it s actually an oldschool cafeteria i did nt know that these places existed anymore and i was ready to be charmed alas that was not to be although i came inside in the mood for pastrami watching the staff throw together  and i mean that quite literally i ve never seen anybody anywhere make a sandwich as quickly or carelessly  i lost my nerve and ordered the meat loaf special thinking that was probably a better way to go in a place like this unfortunately the meat loaf was dreadful as were the mashed potatoes absolutely devoid of any flavor and covered in a gloppy gravy seriously awful i see that one reviewer described it as hospital food that s being charitable because some hospitals actually have edible food it s more like what i imagine prison food to be like it s also not particularly cheap my prison plate was with the tax not recommended
meh in order to tolerate the less than stellar singing at times you really need to be wasted the positives are that there are plenty of hot girls in tempe that flock to this underground club on the other hand the drink options are pretty basic i ll pass the next time i m in tempe
all these negative reviews on here are absolutely right i would have picked stars if i could let s just dive right into this shall we   i m moving out in a month if it were nt for me getting my mail one day and mentioning that i was leaving i would have never known to sign their day notice before leaving otherwise they d charge me the monthtomonth price which was enormous  my ceiling was pouring water constantly where the air filter is i had to switch out bowls and pots around the clock because they were filling so fast i even had to leave work to pour out all the water oh and i put in tons of work requests to get it fixed if you want anything fixed around there call the emergency line  twice i submitted online work requests called twice and finally after about weeks they came and  fixed the problem i say  fixed because about  days ago it started leaking again it s unreasonable that they could nt fix the problem the first time or even when i asked to have it fixed in the first place  bugs when i first moved in there were ants now there are fruit flies and i just can not get rid of them no matter how much i clean these bugs just wo nt go anywhere maybe this has something to do with the fact that i never got a screen door and the lock to my back door was busted before i moved in so bugs found an easy way in neither of which were fixedreplaced by the way thank goodness i live on the second floor otherwise i d feel even more unsafe  it s loud you can hear everything that s happening outside dogs barking kids screaming even people just walking around if you want peace and quiet this is not the place to go  there is a gate at the entrance but i m pretty sure that thing never closes anymore how safe is that  what s the point of having a gated entry if the gate does nt work i ll come back around or at night and it s still wide open when i first moved in it d be closed around or so i should also mention that my code to the gate has never worked if the gate does happen to be closed lrb which is a rarity these days rrb if i do nt have my clicker i m locked out until another car happens to come by  when i first moved in one of their maintenance trucks would constantly park in my designated parking spot forcing me to illegal park somewhere else if you have assigned parking you know exactly how frustrating this is  it s expensive it s not worth paying that amount to live there maybe if the security worked and they fixed things in a timely matter it would be worth it but it just is nt you can find better cheaper places anywhere take my advice use this place as a last resort it s honestly not worth the stress and your money could be much better spent once you sign your lease they forget you exist because they only care about getting paid i m glad i signed the shortest lease i could and i ll be so happy when it s finally up and i can move out next month good luck in your apartment search
this is not a review of the tempe innout burger but all of them i do not even begin to understand the craze over this place you begin with a line that no sane person would actually wait in for a really horrible burger then you get through the line and get your burger the sauce they put on those burgers is so sour it affected how everything else tasted and ruined the whole meal i thought ok maybe it was just this sandwich i tried it again the lines were longer because they had been here about a month longer than the month before and again the worst meal on the planet the hamburger has just about enough meat to fill a whole in a cavity in your tooth and the sauce is awful i will never go here again even if everyone else in my group is i ll hie my butt over to denny s and get a burger with some meat and flavor
ah there s nothing worse than crushing disappointment on a sunday morning well maybe i m being a wee bit melodramatic but when i m famished i tend to get cranky joe s diner is a hop skip and a jump away from our house and i ve been driving past it for months thinking hmm wonder if that place is any good so this morning in what i thought at the time to be a flash of brilliance i looked up joe s diner on yelp lrb which very rarely leads me astray rrb and to my delight this neighborhood establishment had a star average not too shabby and certainly worth a shot right  wrong we walked in and it was busy lrb expected on a sunday morning rrb and we were quoted a  minute wait fair enough but it was absolutely swelteringly hot and humid inside lrb swamp cooler maybe  rrb and smelled funny lrb raw eggs left out  rrb still we waited  there had to be a good reason this place got stars as promised in about minutes the hostess lead us to the back seating area but not to a table and then just left us there standing bewildered a few minutes later another employee saw us there looking lost and hastily wiped off a nearby table and told us we could sit down once seated we were surrounded by tables of screaming children lrb not the establishment s fault by any means but definitely did not improve our experience rrb as we sat for minutes without so much as a glance from any of the servers we soaked in the sweaty stinky dirty lrb did i mention the floors were filthy  rrb loud atmosphere it appeared there was no hope of acknowledgement by a server much less a glass of water or a desperately needed cup of coffee so we threw in the towel we stood up and walked out defeated hungry noncaffinated sweaty and disappointed again without so much as a glance from any of the staff i want to believe that this was just an unusually bad day maybe because it was a busy sunday maybe because the stars were nt aligned who knows and that joe s diner really does deserve it s stars i d love to have a decent lrb if not awesome rrb locally owned breakfast establishment nearby but i do nt know if joe s is that place will we be back to give it another go  maybe only if we re feeling optimistic patient cool and precafinated
i went here on a saturday afternoon to get a waffle cone and some ice cream order some vanilla with some chocolate chips mixed in with a waffle cone the guy starts putting it in a waffle bowl i m like hey i wanted a waffle cone he says well we dont have any what  why  can you make some  i will wait no he says the bowl is the same price fine the bowl was stale and i was pissed shame on you cold stone
seriously  i wish i can say something nice about this place  hmmm thinking thinking nope sorry but i wish i can say that this place is good horrible horrible experiences lrb note i never rate a restaurant on the first visit i rate on the second and third visits because there is always a bad day rrb we visited this place on a busy saturday and were waiting to be seated there was staff that continually would walk by yet no one would offer help or let you know they would seat you finally we are seated and we end up waiting even longer for a server to approach the table there was other tables with people that were having the same problem we ordered appetizers and they took over minutes to come when the food arrived it was burned and the bruschetta looked like charcoal it was so ashy and you could nt even eat it the servers was so lousy that our drinks needed refills and she would walk by multiple times and not even check in the people next to us had a very similiar situation and finally we got up and i walked over to speak to a manager i began speaking to an older man who apparently was the owner i was glad that i would be able to give him feedback hoping he would empathize and be understanding of our experience instead he said am busy right now and i do nt have time to talk i looked at him amazed and i said fine then i am not paying you for your ashy bread and crappy service he looked at me and turned his back i decided to come back to this place it is the only restaurant in verrado so after a golf game we came by and i decided to clear my head and give this place another shot they seated me allot faster because it was dead i figured great at least this time the server should be okay since multitasking would not be necessary she brings us glasses of water and right when i was going to take my fist drink i noticed a big pink lipstick print on my glass i put my head down and just took a deep breath i asked politely for another glass at this point i waited again because either it was the only glass in the restaurant or the server was to busy doing nothing we order a cheese plate lrb forgive me for not remembering rrb and when it comes i seriously just fell off my chair they bring over a large plate with what looked like someone emptying a bag of cut bits of cheese into a plate there was nt a difference in the cheeses and seriously i never have seen a cheese plate like that they serve them with breadsticks aka cheap wrapped sticks for your soup i could nt even eat  of the plate because there was so much cheese on to the entree lrb yes i stayed rrb i ordered a pizza with ham the sauce was bad the ham was very dry and tasted rather sour i suppose for the price i expected better but this place is just lost i honestly have never had such a bad experience at a restaurant or fast food like grazie next time i am in the middle of nowhere i will starve no thank you
what a waste of time service was the worse i have had in ages food was so so there are so many better places to go that care about the costumer will not go back
ca nt believe there are many reviews after my first one years ago to be honest i do nt go there any more for few reasons the owner has changed the foods quality has changed service is not as good as it used to be the original chief seem to be long gone found a better places to have the best dim sum in chandler az once very satisfied customer is no longer their customer if you want real good chinese foods and restaurant services go somewhere else i guess i will never know how good their foods now do nt even want to try
nd trip was quite disappointing ordered a couple of bento boxes the miso soup was not hot barely lukewarm if that wth why ca nt they serve hot miso soup also the rice that comes with the bento box was nt japanese rice it was jasmine rice i would be okay with it but it was undercooked a bit too dry the rice on the california roll was dry too sucks tempura was still decent but the rice and soup really ruined my meal it will be a long while before i head back there again learn how to properly cook rice people
i wish there was less than star because now that they do nt have flour chips there is no point it is just another mexican restaurant  lrb super bummer
first i will say that i have been a regular patron of this hotel in the past for my most recent experience i was treated with extreme disrespect and disregard despite the fact i have chosen this hotel in the past it was a saturday night and my girlfriend and i had returned from a night out on mill ave things turned intimate on the bed but noise levels were well within reason we inadvertently left the curtains open on a second floor room facing the courtyard we finished our activities and got up to get dressed and saw a security guard running across the courtyard screaming at the top of her lungs to close the curtains surprised and embarrassed we immediately closed the curtains and sunk into bed to go to sleep the security guard comes upstairs and pounds on our door demanding we open up as we were tired and not dressed and now that the curtains have been fully closed we attempted to drift asleep this only lasted a short while until our door was pounded on by the police the property was asking us to leave for what  we had to pay a taxi to take us to another hotel and pay for alternative accommodations at least this hotel was hospitable to us we kindly requested a refund from mission palms as we were not able to stay the whole night that we rightfully paid for it took three weeks for the management here to even respond and we were denied this request couples and anyone else who plans on doing what this hotel thinks of as indiscriminate activities in the supposed privacy of the room you pay for beware stay elsewhere
 mins to get service and then another waiting for drinks went to the bar to find out what was going on they finally told us they were looking for the alcohol that goes in the drinks bs avoid this place like the plague
food was poor nachos were burnt waited minutes for check star is generous not sure but i think the ribs were coyote
ok now i was reasonably satisfied being a customer at la fitness the past months and am grateful i motivated myself to get off my ass and get in shape i used all the equipment with the exception of a few things i did nt use the locker room not clean enough for me did nt use the pool did nt do any of the classes lrb did pt for a minute but too expensive rrb a few weeks ago i signed up for a trial membership at the village wow i had no idea what i was missing by being an la fitness member so adios la hello nice ass club with everything i wanted and then some here is where my review gets bad on la cancelling this membership is a nightmare a rrb you want me to fill out a piece of paperwork and snail mail it to irvine before you cancel my membership are you for real  b rrb the customer service number for my area was about as useful as banging my head in a wall the woman who was trying to help me told me and i quote she had never used the website and was unfamiliar with it for real  c rrb the website is all bugged out and glitchy they make it intentionally hard for you to discontinue your membership without going in and being badgered by one of the sales guys good riddance
i wanted to buy the groupon for this place so i read the reviews lrb despite seeing the stars on yelp rrb clearly i am not goin to either buy the groupon now or ever plan to go this place it seems the management neither cares about the reviews here nor does anything to change that plus it pains me to see the correlation between the prices of the items here the quality of foodambiance offered  the ratings on yelp i am sorry i am reviewing this place before actually going here but thank you yelp for the warning not changing this until i see an improvement though
i wish i had a better review for planet subs then i do the staff was so sweet friendly and courteous i could have just hugged the lady behind the counter she was so warm and inviting however i was not impressed with the food my husand and i both shared sandwiches so we can sample what our favorites usually are at sandwich shops we had the super hero lrb italian sub rrb and the tuna the super hero really lacked taste and i could nt differentiate between the different flavored meats the sandwich was very boring and lacked flavor the tuna was simply horrible i grew up in new york and i might have high expectations but i expect tuna salad to have a thicker consistency and not have a brown coloring to it the tuna was very thin in consistency and tasted like poor quality tuna again i wish i had a better review because the staff was so sweet and we need more businesses with such a friendly affect  but the food just did nt cut it for me
if you are looking fot tennis classes for your kid this is not a place to be they have one basic class and put all their also getting money back is really a problem very poor customer care and a very bad place for tennis lessons staff is clue less and management does not care too
dining at lo cascio was a horrid experience to the restaurant s credit the staff was pleasant and friendly that s all i can say that was positive about my evening the food was nt even mediocre in quality the salads were nothing more than a large plate of romaine lettuce leaves with one tomato wedge and two black olives the pasta had a disproportionately small amount of sauce to go with the huge plate of overcooked spaghetti noodles the marinara sauce itself was very generic the only reason it had any flavor at all was due to the overabundance of garlic they packed into it the two meatballs in my spaghetti and meatballs came on a separate plate covered in what seemed like canned tomato paste if you do nt mind generic tasting italian food this place would be fine except they do nt charge generic prices at around fifteen dollars a plate i would hope for a little more quality in the food that is served then there s the issue of the restaurant s ambiance my boyfriend and i dined in the bar so we could watch college football there was one patron at the bar who farted gargled his alcohol like it was mouthwash and made loud repugnant comments like this shot tastes like vomit i understand that s not necessarily the restaurant s fault and in a bar people tend to be a little more rowdy however the bar was serving the full dinner menu and this repulsive behavior happened right in front of the bartender who said or did nothing as disgusted patrons tried to eat dinner i m sure you can imagine how hard it would be to eat within the proximity of a man who was passing gas incessantly as a full time student who also works full time i do nt get a lot of evenings out i believe you dine out for a good meal as well as a fun experience lo cascio failed miserably at both of those things the check was around fifty dollars and for that i left feeling grossedout frustrated and ripped off i will never risk one of my evenings out at lo cascio again
i ca nt figure out how we made such a mistake with this place with such good reviews first it was expensive lrb for takeout  a sesame chicken a schezuan chicken and fried rice i was expecting a tab closer to  with tax rrb when we got our takeout home we were hopeful all of my fellow yelper s reviews were so glowing now i m convinced that every person who rated it with stars was paid to do so or came just for the tea and fortune cookies  but i m not sure as we did nt eat in our food was inedible i m serious  and usually once i ve shelled out a few bucks for something i ll at least hunker down and eat it but instead i d rather go hungry tonight and my husband will eat anything so for him not to touch his dish is pretty reassuring to me that i m not just some crazy snob who does nt like the food lrb and chinese is never a bad choice for me i ve never given up rrb the sesame chicken tasted like soggy chicken nuggets bland and mushy the schezuan chicken clearly was made up of canned chicken tiny nondescript bits of white meat that seemed extremely processed lrb not fresh at all rrb and in some sort of spicyketchup sauce the fried rice was the only thing i would consider worth eating but was full of the same cannedchicken processed crap i m serious you could almost confuse the meat here for chicken of the sea same preserved flavor and that s not the msg talking maybe we ordered the wrong things i do nt know but we literally took about bites each and stared in remorse at our inedible dinner as we contemplated calling for a refund or going out for a frozen pizza never again will i eat here they were so nice  so nice that s about the only remarkable thing about this place unlike other yelpers i would try any other place in the valley before returning for more of the same here
i was helping my friend move out and they went back into to get the rest of their stuff and the apartment complex locked them out let it be known they were paid through the end of the month hmm  so the rest of their stuff is still at the apartment which by law they have paid for until the end of the month can you say law suit 
i ended up walking out of this place without even ordering it was way too pretentious masked as artsy for me this is one of those restaurants operated by people who think their youknowwhat sounds like roses and just because they call appetizers tapas they can charge an arm and a leg for them if you want to discuss the dichotomy of society and the benefits of mao while you pick at a single morsel of duck cooked in the tears of republicans this is the place for you if you want food go somewhere else
i really wanted to like this place my partner and i were thrilled to see a mediterranean buffet open in central phoenix a food type that has been sadly overlooked in this part of town we saw the sign and went in hoping for the best we were the only customers though another couple did come in look at the buffet and leave the food was mediocre but i do have to say the potatoes and the tabouleh were both very good most of the other food looked like leftovers from lunch or the day before owners  if you are reading this you still have some great potential with this place here is what you have to do if you want my business again  get rid of the asian decor and invest in actually making the place look like the mediterranean place you want to be for a few thousand dollars you could make this place look really cool  do nt worry about filling up all four of the buffets why not close down two of them and focus on putting out half the food  but make it really good that would cut down on your food waste and get people excited about your food  sorry but naan curries and other indian delights are not mediterranean just leave them off did i see burritos on the buffet as well  really now  i want to like this place consider closing for a week and redecorate redesign the menu on the buffet and try again unfortunately like it is right now i do nt think you will see us back any time soon
i m with you brenda i ca nt either this place sucks though and they must have been giving land away to build this inefficient airport i was passing through on connecting flight and my layover was hrs lrb  rrb the time was pm on a sunday and seriously almost every restaurant was closed i must have walked over miles lrb some moving walkways were down rrb checking out every terminal for food only to find an open burger king in term which was busy and did nt even get my order right you would think the airport would have at least a mexicansouthwest joint if you have to connect through here bring your own foodsnacks especially if it s in the evening
this was our second unfortunate visit to stingray at scottsdale quarter the service was truly awful the food came out unevenly and people including a child did not get their food for minutes avoid oh and both the waitress and manager mocked us terrible place
i take my boys there age months and years old we have a membership and go or times a month the museum is great and a lot of fun but unfortunately some of the staff is completely rude not to mention it is always so crowed the small kids get trampled almost every time we go the staff yell at me or my children my children are not bad or rowdy the are just being kids the climber is so high and looks very dangerous my child talked me into taking him up so i tried going up with my puse and was told no puses you need to put it under the stairs lrb where the sign says not responsible for lost or stolen property rrb wish she would have told me before my child ran off ahead of me because i was stuck yelling for him to come down the employees should ask a little nicer not with such a rude tone they should put up a sign saying no purses or bags another time they yell at them and say do nt run they could say walk please the final straw was today when we went into the and under room and were harassed by an employee shereyl she asked me and my friend and her year old times how old my son was and i said she followed him around and yelled at him everything he did my son wouldnt play because he was scared of her we left and overheard her talking about us to other staff members saying he was not and heard them talking rudely about us we said we wanted to speak to a manager right away and the manager came over being rude and would only say we can not have kids older than that is the last time we will go there and its unfortunate because we bought a membership lrb make sure if you go into the toddler room you have a birth certificate for your children they need to have staff education on how to talk to customers and children
the nails look great the people are nice but omg no scrub barely any lotion water not that hot totally overcharged me dollar pedicure because they added bucks for french and design added to the dollars i was so disappointed they also didnt use a scrub and the place smelt like horrible nailpolish and my nails smelt bad no nice lotions or scrubs or anything but it was clean that was my biggest criteria just realized they overcharged me here on the bill do not ever go here they suck and i cant go complain because i dont live in the area so i am really mad
i need to preface this review with one statement i used to love the food i used to be a regular here and told just about anyone that would listen how good it was here is the bad i was eating lunch here one day and broke a tooth on a bone or large piece gristle i was not just a chipped tooth but an actual break i informed dan maldonado the owner before i left he was seemed genuinely concerned and cooperative i went directly to the dentist and was informed it would need a crown a few days later i went to tacos atoyac to discuss this with dan he was the exact opposite and informed me that his cousin was a lawyer lrb big deal rrb and that it was up to me to prove it happened there well i gave dan the benefit of the doubt and let him know i was not there to shake him down really all i wanted was an apology and a little help with the dental costs which amounted to over i left my card and waited a couple of weeks for a call i never expected him to cover all of it or even half of it i was looking for a little acknowledgement i never got it i stopped by a couple of times and dan was either not there or too busy to talk i expected more courtesy to his credit he offered to buy my burrito the last time i was there unfortunately it was was weak attempt to make amends i did not accept because this was never about money as far as the food make your own choice but be careful it could cost you more than and the owner could care less about the repercussions to his customers
extremely rude service not only on the phone but in person at this location do not recommend was told on phone that there was a minute wait and i could get my blood drawn and i drove to this location and the door was locked and women would nt speak to me through the door and just yelled we can t help you we are closed i guess i showed up a few minutes past them closing even though they were treating patients still the woman was nt even willing to speak to me like a human in order to answer my questions or apologize for giving me incorrect information i stayed outside shocked by this behavior not only was i given incorrect information on the phone but i was treated horribly i am going to switch my lab needs to lab corp it is probably a blessing in disguise as who knows if getting blood drawn is safe here with the angry people they have working there
eek methinks not indeed okay i never usually give a place a star because i have this moral dilemma with it but i also never usually walk out of a restaurant so i walked in was awkwardly greeted and told to have a seat it was lunch time so the place was full but not overflowing with stressed out customers in all honesty it was a typical lunchtime scenario inside  i d also like to note that i read reviews for slower than average service so i was prepared to wait a little extra to try the food  once i sat down i noticed the server bringing menus over to the patrons that entered immediately before me but he never came over with one for me i decided to patiently wait for the next five minutes that s when i started overhearing the conversation at the table next to me and to sum it up i do nt know if we can stay and eat we might have to get it to go we ve been waiting a long time again that s not verbatim but it s exactly along those lines i figured the reviews were right about the food prep times and continued to wait after a few more minutes passed by another couple walked in were acknowledged and seated and after a minute they were given menus lrb this is about  minutes in rrb it was then that the server came over with water for the first couple that had walked in before me he then walked back to the drink area and brought out two more glasses of water for the couple that came in almost ten minutes after me with no menu water or sense of appreciation for wanting to spend my money at fresh mint i got up and walked out a good way to lose a customer is to not serve them with service complaints since on yelp i really think something needs to be done that was unbelievably insulting
i would not recommend this business their bill exchanger is broken with a sign that states repairs are not scheduled the attendants do not have cash so any bill denomination you insert in their machine will be loaded to a prepaid card minus fee those machines also malfunction often causing purchases of new cards when you are only trying to add funds to an existing card each card costs no refunds i put the card in my purse and when using it at the dryer got an error card damaged no one available for balance refund must buy new card the front loaders leak detergent the attendants do not speak english over two visits i lost in fees and a malfunctioned card lrb that balance was lost rrb there are cleaner cost effective customer servicing laundry facilities in the valley  i suggest you use any of them just not this one on indian school and th ave
not sure wha happened to their quality control but it went out the window the donuts were terrible i will not be back
i hate this fucking stinky ghetto shithole my car was broken into here in broad daylight there s always unsavory characters lolling about and that s just the people that work there they roll one distrustful eye up towards you lrb the other obscured by emo fringe rrb and glare at you for even daring to disturb them as for the people that shop here if you stand too close you will probably catch lice and get exposed to tuberculosis in one shot every time i come here without fail there is some sorry sack of shit at the pharmacist counter trying to convince them they just lost their written prescription for vicodin or their percocets got stolen all with emmyaward winning shows of anguish and pain so you re asking now why i even come here and i do nt blame you i work long hours and this is the closest hour pharmacy to my humble abode sometimes a girl does nt have time to drive to a firstworld facility what can i do except clutch my bag extra close scaredoldlady style and take an extra long shower with extra disinfecting soap when i get home
this is why you should nt eat mall food upon being seated we were given metal bowls and were instructed to put our ingredients in these bowl choose your meats veggies and sauce and hand it off the to dudes around the grill simple concept but i wished the ingredients were more fresh the entire restaurant was sticky from their laminated menus to tables to the floor to the soy sauce bottles no wonder they gave you wet wipes you needed to sanitize your entire space before you ate my food was delivered to my table and just what i expected junk while i had a lot of control what goes in my food for a firsttimer how the hell would i know what the sauces taste like  they did have mimosas during their happy hour that was probably the best part but the food was nothing more than a mishmosh of crap
the food is terrible we sent order back and they were highly offended i was offened they even served it to me everything was dripping with grease over fried over cooked garbage the managerowner said if you do nt like the food thats not my problem i think it is when you only have tables being used on a friday evening if you want real tasty authentic food go to las cazuelas n dysart rd ste surprise do not waste your time and money at lupita s dump you ll spend more on toilet paper then you did on your bill cause your stomach will reject this trash
just an egg and cheese breakfast burrito came with random grills scraps just nasty egg tasted like it was cooked with engine oil
communication issues bunch of rednecks around this place a word of warning ask for your credit card back because the cashiers just forget it and then if you call back they pretend to have returned it to you
i was disappointed to see the prior yelp page removed  why  because it was accurate  this place lrb when it was at its prior location way back when rrb used to be cool when there was a sense of community they had flyers local periodicals not anymore and not only that they do readings directly in front of the tarot deck cabinet  l literally have to walk around the table to get to the tarot cards  so i m minding my own business looking for a deck and i have to hear someone s personal stuff like um hello  is nt that a little bit unethical  for entertainment value is one thing but would you youtube your appointments with your financial adviser or physician for everyone to see  i mean cmon show some  bleep  respect for the people coming in to your store and give them a little privacy i would nt want customers strolling by me if i came in for a reading it s just tacky everything in this review is accurate and can be corroborated and i d be glad to repost the same sentiment if the store tries to whitewash their yelp page again namaste
worst uspa ever rude old angry women very slow one sat and chatted up with her home girl for like latterly minutes while people were in line im not over exaggerating at all either i had to leave to the walgreens down the street to by tape lrb because the uspa charges for clear tape rrb and when i came back she was still talking to her friend
i can not fathom why somebody  would go here other than the cruel initiation of a community college rugby hazing or you are someone who thinks some chick from mountain view will check out your onions if you buy her a couple of screwdrivers
i worked about yards away from tony s for about a year so i ve experienced a lot of what they have to offer i am writing this review because i am utterly shocked that anybody would rate this above or stars they do nt bother to turn on the lights in the back of the store most days the canned foods in the grocery area are dusty i ate here probably half a dozen times and each time the sandwich had an odd whang to it that i ca nt identify it was nt  bad  per se but i quickly learned to spend another dollars for subway down the street i ended up coming here for sodas and candy because it was so close to where i worked until i caught on that i had to check the expiration date on all the items i am sure that the expired sodas and candy bars were nt dangerous but i sure got a nasty tasing one from time to time also the prices randomly change based on who is ringing you up it s an ok stop if you re hard up for cash and have a hankering for a sandwich with a weird taste and do nt mind rummaging through foodstuffs to find fresh items but certainly never go out of your way to eat here
went to thai basil on chandler in ahwatukee a little over a year ago and have nt been back since we waited over an hour for our food and it was burnt and tasted bad and it seemed like the whole place had no idea what they were doing got a front row seat to a rather portly gentlemen who was picking up a to go order and had to wait over an hour for it as well once he got in the restraunt to pick up his food guy made a huge scene in front of everyone in the joint while he yelled at the staff and eventually walked out after they refunded him his money if i want this kind of service and food i ll go eat over at native new yorker on cheap chicken wing night if you want good thai food go to yupha s in tempe that place destroy thai basil in every single way period
when your website specifically says you are open from to on sunday you should be open when i take the time to drive there with a friend at pm
rude the man working here today had no interest in my business i simply wanted to ship some documents but instead of outlining options or helping me he just pointed at a display of envelopes and said i had to buy those first when i grabbed a single express envelope he just said i could nt use that instead of explaining that i could use that to ship express when i said i would go to a ups store instead he just said yeah and walked away horrible customer service  i wo nt be back to this location
awful worst dining experience i have had in a long time i wish i could give negative stars  i wanted to look at a menu but the waiterfront of house guy kept pushing the buffet so we reluctantly gave it a try  i wish we had just left the restaurant  food was mediocre at best once you got past the fact that it was dry cold and tasteless  the ambiance was dreary and the incense was nauseating  there is also no place to change a diaper in addition to the fact that the bathroom was not stocked with toilet paper or paper towels and the floors were grimy and sticky gross  when it came time to pay i was charged  no joke when i brought it to his attention he acted like i was the one inconveniencing him then after completely screwing my finances for the day he had the nerve to get on to me about my card declining when he tried to charge it for the correct amount fully embarrassed and infuriated i had to ask my friend to cover me i will never return to this establishment there are so many other better thai restaurants in the area i do nt even know how or why these people are still in business do not go here
okay i buy most of my shrubs and trees at bakers but they were out of what i wanted so off to berridges they had or of the vine i wanted but they looked aweful the employee explained that they had all been hit by some mold disease but picked one out and told me it would be fine i was doubtful but needed this vine i paid about  more for it and it never grew and eventually just died nothing i have ever bought at bakers or even home depot has ever refused to grow and in case you re wondering i got four of that same vine elsewhere later and they are growing well you might be saying to yourself why did she buy it if it looked bad  because i trusted the nursery guy boo
cowboy ciao well no yeah you have all heard the hype excellent food etc it was medicore at best we had some small plates just to test the waters at this place i have been wanting to try it for years and finally we got a chance to go what a complete disappointment we had the chopped salad server upsold us from the salad that seemed better imo the chopped salad was nice for about bites then it got boring so boring i could barely taste it after the th bite not real strong in flavors not enough salt to bring out the flavors very blaaa next we moved on to the mac and cheese yuk absolutely aweful dry flavorless with a hint of spice boring no real cheese flavor totally disappointed but ate it anyway next we had the dungeness crab enchilada s boring no real taste of crab in the enchilada even though i did have a ok amount in there all i could taste is the spicy cream sauce poured on top very bland never a taste of fresh crab that would have made the enchilada not good at all we did have sampler desert plate lrb on the house rrb which was very good the mousse was great cheesecake was excellent but i was slightly disappointed again in the bread pudding that is so talked about not very flavorful little dry and the compote overpowers the bread pudding sorry but vanilla ice cream alone works best overall totally disappointed will never go back i have had better way better for the same price service was great though our watress was wonderful
is it wrong that buffets to make you more dispondantangry as you eat  i ve only had to leave in the middle of a buffet one time before i was full becaues of seriously bad food and this was number the food was practically flavourless  the honey chicken tasted as though they took spaghettio sauce and some sugar mixed in and called it a sauce so much other food was completely void of any flavor the only halfway decent food was the chow mein even the service was lacking  no one asked how the food was or if there was anything i needed the cashier barely muttered the amount i was due and that was it you re much better off at other places
went to new amore sports grill with my wife and kids my son loves the amore pizza in mcdowell mtn ranch and thought that this would give us a place for the kids and mom and dad to have a beer as well packed my pocket with quarters as the kids love video games etc on a friday night there were about ppl in the bar and a few families in the restaurant we sat down ordered a burger couple pizzas and wings went over to get the kids setup on the video bowling game sat down to drink my beer when the owner walked over with the kids and said the games are really for adults that they could finish the game as long as i stayed with them lrb video games are adjacent to but not in the bar rrb from what i heard they owner lrb s rrb were involved with temple bar in mcdowell mtn ranch and did not like the families that came in with kids not sure hethey understand the demographics of the area pretty easy to understand with the internet now obviously this is the opinion of a parent so let s talk about the food the burger was ordered medium temp came out dead done my wife and i intended to split it neither us finished our half the wings were huge lrb bigger than normal rrb but were really tough and under cooked the pizza was mediocre at best is smallest and was basically flavorless and had a huge crust bottomline if you want a beer and have the time to drive past zipps temple or lazy lizard try this place if this were the closest place to eat get some gas and keep driving it will likely be better
after a long craving for korean food i decided to dart into soul garden while in tempe it had received mixed reviews so i thought it was worth a shot the food was awful to the point of barely edible the meat was essentially lumps of fat and the prices were outrageous in comparison to the quality the most abysmal aspect of the experience was the service the waitress did nt have a great grasp of english and this made ordering difficult when we were done and ready for the check we could nt get anyones attention on the other side of the booth the two women sat watching a small television we were the only customers in the restaurant the entire time upon catching their eyes they would pointedly look away eventually we were able to get the check and left unhappily
i have never stayed at diamond resorts international but after watching a undercover boss episode on cbs i have decided i never will the ceo of the company stephen cloobeck was not the most emphatic person lrb which is a polite way to say he treated a lot of his employees like a real jerk rrb in some instances he was downright mean and abusive in his positional authority i would not support an organization that does not support and treat its employees with dignity and respect it would be great if he took he meaning of yes and applied it to his diamond resorts international employees and guests alike
i am have been coming to native new yorker since they opened but today the foodwingsservice we re horrible the wings there we re so tiny as if the killed a baby chicken the bones were so brittle that it jammed in the side of my mouth the waitress never came back for any refills and to top things off they were not busy i am so disappointed with location i specifically requested fresh wings avoid this location star for crappy day here
i have to say that i m really disappointed by amore sports grill my philosophy is if you put an item on your menu then your patrons should have a reasonable expectation that the item will taste good i had the meat calzone and it was so bad i only ate half of it if you think about it a calzone is like a deep dish pizza with a crust on it i gave some to my wife and she actually asked the server if this was frozen lol the server replied that it was made from scratch so i m not believing that the pizza tastes any better and i m pretty sure i wo nt return since the restroom smelled like they fired their cleaning crew a week ago
a group of of us just sat down on their patio after being told when we walked in to just have a seat anywhere after about minutes of not being noticed one of us walked inside and kindly asked for some menus we were assured there would be a server shortly minutes later a waitress came out but did nt have menus and said she would send out somebody else more minutes later still nobody had acknowledged us even though the person we first talked to had looked directly at us multiple times we literally did nothing rude and feel like we were deliberately ignored or at best just forgotten about i do nt think this place will be receiving any business from us in the future
first off i have never gotten out of that restaurant without paying at least with a family of four around  not including drinks the food is okay if you like a slice of pizza that is mainly made up of sauce and bread with barely any cheese or toppings so much sauce it was like soup then to top off the crappy food was the staff it is  degrees outside and they had a problem with us wearing shorts and flip flops but hey they still let us in maybe the reason our food was crappy was because they did nt like our clothes until things change i wo nt be wasting any more money here i suggest that if this restaurant wants to survive they need to re think their menu and straighten up the employees attitudes big time and to everyone else who put more than stars on your review either you do nt have tastebuds or you got paid to do your review
this place was terrible myself and a couple of friends made our way into the heart attack grill very hungry after checking out a spring training game everything was cool until we walked in the building and got a whiff of the grease filled air as we were entering the building one of the guys in the restaurant was getting wheeled out of the joint in a wheelchair after finishing their quadruple bypass burger the guy s face was full of regret as he was wheeled by us we finally sat down and each of us ordered a singlebypass lrb single patty burger rrb the thing that was delivered had some sort of a resemblance to a hamburger but i was nt quite sure i took one bite and i thought i was going to throw up it was like eating crisco straight i tried my best to stomach more and at least get some of my money s worth but i had to quit after the third bite the two redeeming qualities about the place if at all was that rrb the girls working that day were pretty cute and rrb they serve bottled coke that uses real sugar other than that there is absolutely no reason to eat at this place since there are other places that serve way better burgers for half the price or that have better looking girls with a lot less clothing on lrb hooters rrb
although the dental practice looks professional and clean the staff was not genuous in their concerns of my comfort yes they said what you wanted to hear but you can tell when someone is not sincere as soon as i said i was nt sure about coming back or my discomfort when i had my teeth cleaning they called me everyday not to check up to see how i was doing with the tooth i originally came in for care but to see how quickly they can give up my appointment to fit in someone else everyday at least twice a day they called and not one of those calls or messages were to ask about my pain on the tooth that s when you know the dentist and staff is nt about your comfort and health of your teeth yes we are all in business to make money but money comes with success of making your patients happy not treating them like another dollar sign and to be charge more than for a teeth cleaning is ridiculous
the worst sushi in my life too undercooked sushi rice lrb like longstored bad grain rrb not fresh smelly and dry fish lrb low quality rrb what should i say more  in my dinner menu wine was only thing i could eat
well we went back for a nd time  this will be the last time we go to scott s deli it was over degrees today and the ac was not working it was very warm in the restaurant which made our dining experience pretty miserable they had all of their ceiling fans on at full blast in the backroom which dried up my contact lenses  our napkins would keep flying off the table we got the greek omellete and the cucumbers in it were bitter had to take them all out the waiter never even said  i m sorry i am from la and there are faaar better deli s there than here in phoenix this deli was pretty average nothing like jerry s deli or canter s deli in la now we re talkin on a side note i am so sick  tired of always seeing sports on tv s in restaurants okay for sports bars or maybe applebee s but it is like everywhere you go it would be refreshing to actually see a movie playing on a tv at a restaurant something that the whole family can enjoy watching just saying rrb
ghetto you know i realize we live in arizona and grass is hard enough to grow in our ridiculously harsh climate and having dogs trample all over it all day makes it even harder that being said i have visited many dog parks with grass so can someone explain to my why this dog park is  gravel  i m not even sure it s all gravel i think there may be some needles and broken glass mixed up in there the place is all sorts of hilly with nasty scratchy bushes everywhere our dog rally did not care for this place at all after sniffing the perimeter he came back and laid down next to us also not a good place for people as there is only one bench and very very minimal shade
service is bad pizza is mediocre and they charge full price for  toppings you can easily do better
i dont think this even deserves a star its am on monday and they dont have hot chocolate bad look for a donut shop worst part is the rudeness of attendant
my florist cafe is misunderstood  by nearly everyone living in phoenix you get used to how things are if you own a food spot it s either a coffee shop a bar or restaurant much like the clear zoning lines between residential and commercial phoenix food spots are either this or that and rarely allowed to be anything else  it would be too confusing so while the complaints about my florist cover a variety of subjects from the lousy menu the lousy food and the lousy service it s only compounded by the fact that when you enter my florist you re expecting to enter an actual restaurant someplace you can get hot food drinks and listen to jazz music while sitting there pretending you re in a completely different city one that s more metropolitan one that s more urban and cool one that does nt shut down at oclock my florist cafe fails consistently and miserably oddly years of bad service bad food and surprisingly boring bread have nt stopped people from giving this place a chance over and over again sure they have one of the best jazz pianists in all of phoenix lrb at least that you can find easily without having to be in any sort of music circles rrb but is that really enough  with the servers dressed up disappearing regularly and delivering plates full of hard nearly unedible bread while having no knowledge at all about any of the wines they re suggesting why do people continue to frequent this place  i think our expectations are too high take away the bad service do nt expect too much out of the food disregard any of the servers suggestions regarding wine and what do you have  probably one of the more unique atmospheres you can find in phoenix for the price and the location there really is nt anything like the ambiance you ll get at my florist cafe with an upscale decor enough tables to comfortably fit a small group the jazz piano in the background and the hum of coversation filling the room i would dare say that there is nt anything like this anywhere else in phoenix sure there are different places to go such as chez nous but comparing the two would be wrong where chez nous is a great dark soulful rb lounge my florists is excellently open and bright however in the end my florist cafe has spent years and years unchanged you can only say a restaurant could be so much more for so long after a while you decide to give up on it you decide that it really wo nt change you decide that for some unknown reason the servers are different every week and so are their managers  but at least the woman playing piano can generally be counted on my advice  try my florist once a year do nt order any food and definitely do nt order any bread bring some friends order a bottle of wine of your own choosing not the server s suggestions and have a great time in one of phoenix s few unique cafes
the food was generally awful the sweet potato fries were the only good thing i ate the chicken sandwich i ate was very dry and service was not the best what should have tipped me off was all the other restaurants around were filled and had to minute waits but coal burger was nt even halffull wo nt return to this place ever they should cut there loses and close their doors and let another business have a shot here in the scottsdale quarters
at on  i was commuting to work at phoenix sky harbor airport along i on my motorcycle when mayflower cab  come on an on ramp and cut me off and just about broadsided me the driver was talking on the telephone i contacted the company and they assured me that the driver would be reprimanded
horrible food
mixed feelings about this location the food is always great but the service is lacking mostly on the managerial level we ve been ordering from this location since it opened and i think we finally had it last week i ordered a pear and gorgonzola salad and a couple of other things well first i got a call from the manager telling me that they were on their way but that they did nt have lays chips i agreed to a substitute even though she said they were on their way they still took minutes to arrive lrb we are only blocks away rrb and of course something was wrong on my order the pear and gorgonzola salad was sans pear when i called a man simply and politely told me i would get a replacement salad on my next order i agreed so i ordered today by phone even though i tend to order online lrb keeps my order simple and minus the human error rrb well everything went smoothly until i brought up the salad the guy taking the order did not put me on hold and only covered the phone so i heard everything they were shouting back and forth the manager said i was lying and that she was nt giving me anything for free she then came on the phone completely aggravated and told me she could add a topping to my pizza excuse me  when i told her that i d like what they initially promised me she said that people often scam them and lie and use double coupons etc so it was weird they did nt take care of it at the moment it happened so she denied it and when i began getting aggravated she screamed and said you wo nt even let me talk i listened to her call me a liar and she wanted me to be cool i told her we had been their loyal customers for a long time and i ve never even used a coupon or gotten anything for free in fact i ve never even called to complain about all the other mistakes they ve made in the past she finally agreed to my demand only after asking to cancel my order and saying i would never eat there again why did it have to reach that point  i could only say that it is part ignorance and lack of professionalism of course the salad arrived with three very thin slices of pear not to mention the fear of eating the food that cost us over they just lost a great customer and by the looks of it they are losing many more ps if anyone has their corporate number please send it to me
if i told you no ketchup and i got ketchup  please do nt just wipe it off i am never too good for a fast food meal every once in awhile but this specific bk tasted like cardboard
well were to start  it might be because i just had some of the best sushi on the plant at tei tei in dallas but i was nt impressed here in the slightest my highlights  oolong tea  gari low lights  rice it was almost like mochi just a gooey mess  fish was very cold it was almost like it was almost to the point of freezing and then served thus leaving the fish with little to no taste  loads of scallions on everything rolls and nigiri i assume to give it some flavor  nigiri all had loads of ponzu on it once again to give it a flavor this place has numerous good reviews and i will tell all of you to look harder i had better japanese in scottsdale last year i think it was at kyoto update update  best sushi in phx is far and away yasu treat yourself and see what the real deal is like you will not be disappointed
after two negative experiences i wanted to give this location another chance only to be severely disappointed once again upon walking into the door i am greeted lrb if you can call it that rrb with a what s the last name the girl behind the counter obviously could care less about customer service since she gave less than none not even a hint of a smile the girl looked as if she were going over everything else she would rather be doing in her head i felt not only unwelcome but disrespected as a paying customer i came with a friend who had never done a spray tan before and i let the girl explain to her how to do it i myself have worked in a tanning salon for over years and every direction that the girl gave my friend was  wrong to keep my friend from having her spray tan ruined i explained the correct way for her to apply barrier cream pose etc when it came my turn for the spray tan i stepped into the booth onto the metal plate and was pracitcally standing in a puddle lrb a problem i had had before rrb i went up to the front and asked lrb very politely rrb if she could please wipe down the plate because it was still very wet not only did the girl roll her eyes at me but she did not entirely wipe the plate i was still standing in wetness during my spray on top of everything else i ended up having water drip on me from the ceiling of the booth due to the fact that the machine had not been properly wiped down after sanitization any vet spray tanner will know how detrimental having water drip on you during a spray tan can be it goes without saying that i will not be returning to this location any more and neither will my friend if any managers are reading this and are interested to know who the girl was that was working i visited on  at pm at the tempe location
i ordered asada burrito with beef wow it is big one bite another bite all i taste was lettuce i cut burrito into half i found lettuce and discolored avocado oops looks like discolored avocado but it was burned meat if you like lettuce burrito this is the place
i thought i would try out this location big mistake first parking is a nightmare second i sat inside first and went unnoticed for minutes then a fight broke out so i moved to the outside bar where there was no bartender twenty minutes in i was getting up to leave when waitress finally asked if i wanted a beer a dollar pbr was nt bad so i figured why not i felt completely ignored for minutes will never come back i m halfway through my pbr and ca nt wait finish it so i can leave
sales dept complete thieves year old mother with dementia went in yesterday and was talked into paying for an optima way over sticker she can not afford this car and so i called the manager who basically told me too bad once the car leaves it s hers extremely rude and unprofessional they are everything you would expect from a sleazy car dealership and more
the loudest place i ve ever tried to relax and sleep in absolutely ridiculous
most ghetto walgreens i ve ever been too people outside begging for money exit is blocked off by the register so you have to walk around even if you go to the liquor side employees look like they hate their jobs other than that this place is great
gross as gross can be you ll never catch me  eating here ever again airports are not all notorious for their gourmet reasonably priced restaurants but this place made me feel taken advantage of as the only place to grab a drink while waiting an hour and a half to board my flight i excitedly headed toward jackalope flats it s walls are peppered with vintage household items and of course that adorable little jackalope we all know and love the menu is pretty basic chili salads nachos burgers and sandwiches i ordered the turkey club  sliced turkey swiss cheese crispy bacon lettuce tomato and spicy chipotle honey mayo on sourdough bread  sounds good wrong the meat is the worst quality water pressed turkey and the cheese was swiss american lrb a couple sparse holes and little flavor rrb the mayo tasted more sweet than spicy and the bread was so hard it cut the roof of my mouth i could nt even eat the sandwich it was so horrible i guess the beer is the only good thing here because i ordered a mimosa that my server recommended to me the champagne was flat and warm when i asked the bar if they could remake it since it was flat and showed them the absence of all bubbles he offered to pour some soda water in it to add some fizz honestly this place is nt worth the money i m spending if this places was nt in the airport there is zero chance it would survive
not sure if it was too late lrb pm  haah rrb or if those in the kitchen were cooking with drowsy palates anyway after driving around with indecisive passengers the other night we all finally agreed on this place initially excited we were not so much enthralled by dinner s end i got the award winning gyro dinner personal opinion of this  not very award winning and did not even intrigue my eyes beef and lamb were dehydrated and vegetables originated from a freezer bag was given scarce pieces of pita lrb should have just brought my own bag of pita chips since this was the case rrb and the tzatziki was not the distinct blend of yoghurt accompaniment it was ranch dressing the gyro dinner is a far cry from award winning dishonorable mention to say the least i suppose my dish and i disliked each other so much that my doggy bag committed suicide atop my car and became mere slop on the pavement
greasy bland poor service flat root beer weak sauce
not good we had a bad batch of ribs lrb tough and grainy rrb and fried mac and cheese was cold it s overpriced and would not recommend to anybody
i ve been in this salon several times over the past couple of years if it were nt for a good friend stylist who worked there i d never have given it a chance but over all the staff members there and the manager for that matter are as rude pretentious and second rate as they come my stylist is worth every penny but the salon is way pricey for it s local if it s the aveda products your after lrb you have good taste rrb you d be doing yourself a favor by driving the extra two miles to salon tru or scottsdale fashion square
blah friends and i decided to visit bacon for some grub at am after drinking and dancing at devil s it was nt busy we were sat and brought waters expeditiously water was the best thing we had here though like other posts we found the menu enticing and lots of items grabbed the attention of our stomachs but nothing we ordered really delivered in true am fashion i ordered nachos lrb rrb they came with baked beans on them seriously  i like baked beans but they have no place on nachos it was like some strange hillbilly version of nachos not very good they were lacking in cheese lrb a staple to good nachos rrb and there was icky iceberg lettuce getting all soggy on them a girlfriend had a breakfast burrito which she described as having almost no taste and the others with us had egg breakfasts that were subpar the server was nice and accomodating but we agreed that we would have to be pretty desperate to eat here again any time soon sorry bacon not this time
i will stick my weiner in a meat grinder before i ever eat here again the chicken lrb if it was indeed chicken rrb was chewy the store itself was dirty lrb dead bugs in areas where they could nt easily sweep rrb if my posts end after this you will know it was from dirty food
you know i am with you thomas everyone s looking for any relief possible from the ridiculous gas prices you pull past the arco and shriek my god look at those low rates lrb as anyone from chicago can hopefully appreciate rrb so you pull in and whip out the debit card and ohwtf  you re gonna charge me extra for using my debit card  well haha i got one over on you hello mileage plus visa wtf you only take debit rrb lrb   ur lrb nfp rrb g   lrb   gfbipu this is a very deceptive business practice imho plus they only authorize for fifty bucks and my frickin altima was last time to fill up so plan on visiting your local ampm for quite some time on your next fill up i only hope your surroundings are better than this sh thole despite the low prices i m afraid i will no longer patronize any arco stations
this place sucks the food sucks and so does the old ugly staff that serves it i would rather starve this place is called kiss the cook but once you have eaten here you ll want to slap the cook save your money and avoid this place it just is nt sanitary
so this is where i just paid for a dollar burger did not taste like what it was suppose to or look like grrrrrrrr was not satisfied and flavor was terrible this is why i hate air terminal foods
update never returned money or call thanks amex for doing the right thing
my son has been going there with his friends and though its different times of the day he has been finding hair in his food that s fucking disgusting i hope this place goes out of business my family will never eat there again
the second hand smoke is stuck in this casino from probably years ago horrible horrible stemch the machines are standard and in the four times i have made the drive to fmc they have taken my money i do nt think the drive is worth the residual smell of smoke on you and the empty wallet
never will i go to this again there was no organization we waited in our car for over min to park lrb should have left then rrb we then paid to park then it was to get in we waited in line for hrs and moved ft and still had ft to go we left at that point with out eating one thing do not go to this event next time
oh man this place smells bad no it s not that old lady smell it s more like a dirty diaper smell i quickly scanned the home goods plastic containers that sell new for at the dollar store were being sold for at this thrift store really  it just seemed that everything was just a smidge overpriced reminds me of the salvation army in that respect i really hope they fix the smell soon then i might try this place in the future and update my review
i had a client s husband pass away so i called for flower service this place didnt even survive my inquiry phone call rude and immediately got the wrong feeling
july   noticed the restaurant s sign is gone  definitely should call before trying to arrange a gathering here
ash trays and smokers at every table outside in obvious violation of az state no smoking law employees and regional manager appeared indifferent to the situation
i ve gone here a couple of times and all times it sucked i sat at the bar and when i tried to ask them about the sushi on the menu they were nt sure what was what seeing as how the menu mixes everything and does nt have whether it s baked or raw and when i did get my miso soup it tasted awful and was cold the sushi was nt even that fresh either made me sick
with one hellofalayover and starving i decided to stop at the blue burrito grille in the phoenix international airport i had many many choices but this restaurant s friendly and warm ambience lured me in i sat down to a semicleaned table that i had to wipe clean myself ok bad but not that bad i was quickly greeted and offered a drink looking over the menu my stomach told me to go with the chicken burrito i had nt had mexican food for quite some time and the restaurant was bragging that they were known for their burritos so bonus bring it on the menu read that it came with all the ingredients that you would expect from a super burrito it was delivered fairy quickly and cut in half which i normally do not prefer come on now i m a big boy now i do nt someone cutting my food into smaller pieces anymore at first glance it looked pretty tasty and then i took a bite disappointment set in and if it was nt for my gross need for nourishment at that point i would sent it back and left this large burrito had no flavor whatsoever except for the taste of leftover chicken that has been reheated there was absolutely no seasoning and one third of the burrito was shredded lettuce adding the accompanying hot sauce did no good either i do nt know what to say i had another bad airport food experience again on this trip and apparently the people who were sitting two tables away were having their own bad experience as well so bad that they got up and left in the end season your meat your food ambience is nice but food especially mexican usually has great flavor so give it to us now that i am home i will be visiting my favorite taco truck in oakland where i can get a real authentic great tasting burrito
we went there for dinner and ordered oz landsharks but got oz beers that did not taste like landshark also half of the menu they do nt make i assume this is because of cutting costs  the place was empty at pm on a sat night no sweet potato fries no beans and did nt have two types of meat for entrees the waiter did nt even tell us they did nt have it until we ordered not recommended at all
went to phoenix for my buddy s rock and roll marathon and on the day we were heading back to la we decided to grab some sushi since it seemed to be on everyone s mind found that there was a ra sushi bar right near the place we were staying at and so what i thought was going to be a decent sushi place  since we have one back in ca ended up turning into a horrible experience to be honest the only good thing i remember about this place was the hot waitress and the green tea lol i mean the service took forever lrb which btw it was around pm and no one was in the restaurant rrb so either we had some beginner sushi chef learning the ropes or they just decided to take there sweet ass time if it were nt for the eye candy and the green tea i would nt be able to give it any stars but i decided to be nice and at least give them a star for effort have fun for whoever decides to try out this place never going back that s for sure  p
the food was pretty decent but the waitresses were inattentive no ambiance good green tea they tried to commit our order to memory which was a colossal failure both orders were slightly wrong
was dissapointed in this last job and was nt so impressed the first time so my fault for going back first if i am paying to have a simple hem done on pants i would hope that would include them pressing the pants second when i put the pants on i am positive they did nt even hem them i will not be taking them back for them to charge me again and will probably be doing the hem myself
leak caused damage to several personal items management was outright rude i had to contact front desk several times to even talk to management it was a totally unacceptable experience this hotel does nt deserve one star
disappointing the avondale location must have different cooksrecipes because i ve eaten there multiple times and always been pleased the scottsdale location on the other hand was terrible the location is good but the restaurant still screams bennigans or luby s or whatever it should be but is nt mexican the salsas were blah again avondale is doing something different the queso was nearly inedible with a very coarse gritty texture the plates came out and although my food was hot my son s plate was cold the cheese enchilada was boring the beef burro was was i do nt know how to describe it if the beef was on a hoagie it would have been a bad philly cheese steak too but it was more suited to that than a mexican burrito overall i apologized to my family that i forced them to go there for dinner considering within minutes of driving there was maggianos gordon biersch and a plethora of great restaurants i was sorry i made them go as we were leaving i commented that the best thing i had was the water and my usually easy going daughter agreed if you find yourself at that corner pick another place
stay away from all pro transmission they are a rip off took my car in and they put a transmission in it about a month later it started making a clanking noise took it back and they said what do you want us to do about it so then they said it was the driveline but i knew it was nt that cause it was new so they took it in and looked  it and said they adjusted it bit it still dose the same thing and now it leaks transmission fluid so i m not taking it back there or would i recommend anyone and to top it off the broke my alarm remote and tried to hide it from me stay far far away from all junk transmission
very poor experience over one hour for food  poor service very expensive  wont be back will go to deluxe anyday over this joint bill for families no thanks
why did this experience suck  hmm should i begin alphabetically chronologically or just as they come to me  chronologically you say  very well then rrb she cut my nails way shorter than i asked rrb in the process of repairing one fingernail she glued the nail to the finger and got glue on my hand she didnt even seem inclined to remove the glue  i had to ask i also had to ask her to clean under my nails  she had polish in hand before i stopped her and made her go back rrb ow ow ow ow ow this tiny asian woman manhandled my hands and filed my fingers as if she were getting even with me for something and this was nt a shiatsu ow that hurts but at least now i can move my right arm much better thanks kinda pain i could nt believe how surprised she looked when i asked her to ease up rrb i screwed up my courage and had her make a second filing pass because despite my considerable reservations i prefer not to snag the edges on everything i touch they re better now  but still a bit jagged rrb this one drives me batshit there s cottonball fuzz stuck in my manicure i had her remove some of it but didnt notice another until after i left rrb the nail that was repaired was not filed flat  there s a big ugly bump in the middle of the nail  on the opposite side of the little crack i was trying to fix rrb both my thumbs bubbled i pointed it out she fixed one and put another thick coat of polish on the other but wait i didnt even get to the pedicure yet rrb ok i admit that it had been a while since my last pedicure but i m literally the only person in the place would it be so much to ask that you not skip the oil and lotion part just because you were tired of complaining the entire way through the cuticle clipping part  rrb when i turned back from watching jeopardy she d added unsolicited nail art to both my big toenails while i was nt paying attention and when i say nail art i mean squiggly green lines across my bright red toes and chunky wet  wild looking silver glitter i said what s that  and she said for holiday even if it had nt been tacky as fuck i count days til christmas can you just do them red please  thanks this marks the first time in my life that i havent tipped for a manicure frankly they re lucky i paid at all
pete s is one of those places i do nt understand growing up in mesa az pete s has a loyal and fanatical following i m not sure why the fish is about as processed as you can imagine lrb rectangular squares of fishlike material rrb the shrimp and crabettes are even worse the only reason i can think of eating at pete s is that you might want to relive the experience of bad junior high school cafeteria food lrb and my school had better food than pete s rrb still the place packs them in and does a land office business so i guess there is no accounting for taste
bland and tasteless except the talapia which tasted like olives and was sent back the service was slow and inattentive the only redeeming quality was the chips while they were fresh and hot the salsa was not even with extra heat requested the salsa was bland this is definitely not a mexican restaurant any mexican would be caught dead patronizing it is definitely a place for gringos with no taste or high expectations
ekkk we went here after reading great reviews and seeing that it was one of the arizona republic s top chinese spots in the valley nothing was good i m sad to report the sweet and sour soup had such an odd overly bitter taste it really was nt edible i ordered their version of happy family and the spicy brown sauce was watery sweet and made the veggies soggy my husband ordered the bell pepper chicken which was just ok we got our order to go otherwise i would have sent the soup and my dish back and maybe would have had a different experience we ve had such a hard time finding a good traditional chinese place in phoenix
i ca nt believe there are nt other reviews on here this place was the worst i will not return here nor will i reccomend it i walked it with bags full i went to the back where there were employees finishing up with another lady i should ve taken it as a hint when the lady said no i ll just take my stuff and sell it on craigslist i can get more out of it that way i stayed to wait it out big mistake the lady left with her stuff the employees did nt even acknowledge me instead they proceeded to talk crap about the lady that just left their exact words what makes them think we even care  take it or leave it i do nt care hello i was standing there they still did nt speak to me as i got up and left other mothers you suck hire people who care who want to work i went to kid to kid on tatum  thunderbird so much better
the worst mc donalds i have ever been in completely turned off when while occupying the restroom i was washing my hands and the person in the stall comes flying out it was one of the employees they did not wash there hands went directly to the counter ready to wait on us we were getting an ice cream cone truly turned us off of that idea we not ever go there again
i have lived in the area for years i really never went into the store until a few years ago when i was pregnant with my little one super super cute stuff  totally up my alley i love shopping at neiman nordstrom etc and especially shopping for baby items  i m not a huge fan of the babies r us lines carters etc dressing my little one is a joy of mine well over the summer i went in with my year old in tow the sales staff was horrific condescending and rude i almost did nt buy the pair of jeans however  i did they were true religion as i got home and washed the jeans the label bled all over the denim lrb generally unacceptable for an authentic pair of tr s rrb  so when i called the store and told them i believe at this time i got the owner  she told me i should just call true religion themselves lrb myself rrb and get a new pair great customer service huh  i had to speak my mind and remind her that i was the customer buying  jeans lrb in a recession mind you rrb and it is her responsibility to replace my denim so when i went in she was so rude  i had just told her to scrap the whole deal and i ll just take my money back and order the jeans elsewhere she refused eventually after a few days of searching for a replacement she could nt find one therefore i got my money back over the last month talking with women they both had similar horrible shopping experiences and wo nt return either they need major attitude adjustments in there
i agree with ian below as well the moonlight masquerade event was the worst planned event i ve ever attended there was absolutely no theme concept the music was atrociously paired lrb and half of the acts were unlistenable rrb they quickly ran out of food drinks and souvenirs within minutes and the tickets were frikkin dollars the botanical garden was quickly becoming a great cultural institution for it s well planned and designed events its great variety of performers and entertainment and its ties to the arts community in the valley i have heard from exvolunteers that all the talented people in the events department have quit or been fired in the last six months because the dimwit department heads do nt want to lose their jobs they are now breaking contracts with performers treating guest artists and garden staff poorly getting cheap and poor quality entertainment and misplanning their events it s too bad looks like a bunch of fools are running the place now and i am disappointed because dbg has the potential to be a real cultural institution in phoenix  a city that has far too few
i would give less stars if i could came here several times and seemed okay but in the last two trips i have found hair and a sharp piece of metal lrb i was told was from a cleaning bristle  yuck rrb in my ramen totally grossed out and terrified of how much it would hurt to ingest metal like that never returning and advise that they are seriously looked into by the health department even more aggravating the lady just said sorry guys to the last problem with our order  no refund horrible place
my wife and i recently attempted to patronize this liquor store i say  attempted because we were nt actually allowed to purchase anything although i showed them my arizona drivers license which clearly shows that i am the clerk refused to sell anything to us because my wife did not have her id with her i pointed out that they were selling the alcohol to me and not to my wife but they were having none of it the clerk repeatedly lrb and rudely in my opinion rrb told me that he was under no legal obligation to ask for her id  it was merely his discretion well to the clerk at top s i say this you do indeed have the discretion to do what you did and thankfully i have the discretion to never again shop at your overcrowded narrow and occasionally smelly liquor store where year old children are allowed to run around behind the counter while you look me dead in the face and seriously tell me you run a legitimate establishment writing this review is also my discretion as is telling all of my friends to never shop at your store again good day to you sir
boy you people just wo nt give me a break on the photo thing one of these days i promise but in the meantime here goes the review this used to be a really great spot but lately it is lacking we stopped in yesterday for a quick cocktail and to meet a friend no great happy hour specials and no happy hour food at all lrb sorry but in this economy i m kinda looking for a break rrb i wound up having the cactus margarita which i asked them to make with sauza and it has to down down as the worst top shelf margarita i realize times are tough all over but it tasted like lemonaid and if there was tequila in it i sure could nt taste it wo nt be coming back we left there and went to sierra bonita where my expectations were more than met please check out the review
on the upside we had one of the three bedroom apartments with a two car garage and it was spacious and had a nice layout it overlooked a nice common area with a gazebo and we were sold on it as soon as we saw it then the complex went under new management unfortunately management changed lrb for the worse rrb shortly after we moved in the grounds simply are nt maintained well prospective tenants can witness the poorly maintained grounds first hand just by touring the common areas and noticing caulking around the doors that has never been painted over and the garage doors that are mismatched in color  with some even being partially painted one might think that this is a sign of an improvement in progress but the simple truth of the matter is that it has been like this for months and they just never finished the job they were still like this when we moved out many maintenance issues go unaddressed particularly on the common grounds items broken and reported with issues are a broken fan in the gazebo a broken sprinkler head that flooded the area around it a faulty light in one of the common areas that strobed in an irritating fashion outside our balcony a washing machine that had gashes in the rim that would snag clothes a dishwasher that would etch dishes and never clean them properly and was characterized by maintenance staff as more of a dish rinser than a dish washer gates to the complex were frequently broken no remote was provided to the gates and ultimately we received one remote that had to be replaced multiple times before we finally got a working one air conditioning breaking on a hot day and not looked at until pm when the issue was reported that morning maintenance guys using very loud gas powered leaf blowers at am on a sunday lrb and other rrb mornings and the list goes on and on the worst part was when our lease expired and continued on a monthtomonth basis they sent us a form asking whether we wanted to renew for another year or go monthtomonth at a higher rate than was specified in our lease when i called them to discuss it they said that what we previously agreed to was nt an option this was a disagreement that bourgeoned into the reason for our final departure i was yelled at by the manager and threatened with eviction when i insisted on sticking to our original agreement at the advice of an attorney i started communicating only through letters and ensured that everything was documented of course once everything started going into writing they suddenly gave in and i did nt have to pay the extra fees like they insisted originally scheduling anything is horrible with them maintenance is only done every other thursday so if you have something broken you generally have to wait for a week from the next thursday since it is usually booked up due to complications of my wife working nights every other week and sleeps during those days combined with their ineptitude at scheduling best case turnaround time was two weeks but more typically it would be a month coordinating with office staff is generally difficult they seldom answer the phone and never call back they will tell you that they ll call back but they wo nt you end up having to walk into the office to talk to them their idea of scheduling maintenance was very unprofessional they would announce that they were going to show up for a week straight and enter your premises lrb which is incidentally illegal since they do not adhere to scheduling reasonable times commensurate with the amount of time required for maintenance rrb if you call the office to arrange a specific time for maintenance  well you probably guessed it  they wo nt answer and they wo nt call back the worst part of it is after they did this to us twice they did nt even show up either time billing was horrible during our last six months there not a single bill was correct they failed to charge me rent one month and charged me rent for the month after i moved out the entire experience was summarized by our moveout inspection we had the usual scheduling frustrations and were stood up twice on the second time i called them up lrb time after time after time until they answered rrb and insisted that they send somebody over because this is already our second time that they stood us up finally the manager shows up and he is undoubtedly angry that we disturbed him and made him come out for the moveout inspection he s just curt briefly looks at the apartment which is spotless and makes a few comments about how we probably did nt give a deposit so we probably wo nt get one back lrb huh  rrb and says that he ll find out when he looks at our lease no wonder the place is horrible  they view the tenants as a nuisance rather than paying customers that should be treated with dignity and respect update  deposit check they provided me bounced

normally we go to the breakfast spot around the corner and with a longer than normal wait at our usual place we decided to give liberty market a try the place is nice on the inside and the pastries on display look amazing so we ordered our food the items on the menu look really good the food arrives and my wife starts looking at the eggs strangely i asked her what was wrong she slid the plate over to me and there were several long hairs cooked into the scrabbled eggs  gross so my kids mom and me looked through the rest of our food before calling the manager over thank goodness we only found the embedded hairs in one set of scrabbled eggs we called the manager over and they apologized and said they would bring a new plate of eggs out which i expected however in any restaurant i have ever been to management at the very least will cover the cost of the plate but normally will comp the meal andor give you a gift certificate so you will come back were we offered any of those from the management  no the food is good but not off the wall good like others have reviewed we all had different versions of the demiplate there are lots of places to eat and not management not offering to at least comp the plate of eggs lrb rrb is just bad business if we had been given a gift certificate to come back we probably never would want to next time we will wait an hour to go next door instead
called about charges on my account that i did not authorize and after a long conversation with mike where i was repeatedly told that i was wrong and he refused to do any thing but charge me additional fees i was hung up on yes hung up on i did not swear but did sound angry lrb and why should nt i be when they hand out my money and then want to charge me to correct it  rrb i went to their facebook page to express my disappointment a post that was removed and then i was blocked so i could not repost so that other unfortunate suckers will not see how truly terrible their customer service is and will continue to be treated like crap by this terrible institution i have yet to be contacted by anyone about being hung up on not even by email which i sent nearly hours ago well guess what scum bags  you can not delete this enjoy your increasing number of complaints and decreasing amounts of money you know that stuff you need to stay in business sincerely someone who is sick of your long branch lines hidden fees and constantly crashing web site buh  there is one star because no stars is not an option
i have lived in this complex since june of i chose it because of the descent prices and proximity to work generally i would say i have been pleased with living here but the longer i have stayed the more learn and the more i want to move out things i learned after moving in or since the store owner of the internal  market was murdered a couple years back by a tenant within he last year a female tentant was raped midday by two indivuals two different instances of tenants dying from drug overdose first floor apartments were broken into in a month and had their flat screen tv stolen a friend of mine had his computer stolen from his car while parked right in front of a security camera the front office has not been helpful or concerned about this their initial response was that new residents were moving in and they would not get to the tapes a couple days later they stated corporate would have to review the tapes it has now been almost three weeks and they still have not contacted me regarding any of this i realize theft is a problem every where but they clearly do nt care about my concerns other lrb nonsafety rrb issues pool maintenance the pool near my unit was shutdown by the city for the majority of the year last year all winter the pool was shut down the the point ducks moved in then in the peak of pool season they finally drained it to retile and make repairs but the time it was open again pool season was nearly over other pools are frequently dirty without operable chairs or the key to enter has been changed lights many of the lights around the complex are burned out or broken the light by my unit is out it was replaced a couple months back and burned out almost immediately i am specifically not calling to report it to see how long it takes for a repair cleanliness many of the tenants lrb myself included rrb have dogs there have been periods of time where everywhere i look there seems to be dog poop and all the bags to pick it up are gone i have also noticed a lot of the tenants toss chicken bones into the grass and bushed around the grills i have seen trashdead birdsgrass clippingsvomitt left for days at a time oh and if you choose to move in and then wish to leave you better save up if you want to break your lease it is going to cost you big time
at comerica theater lrb insert your fav band name here rrb will sound like thump thump thump muffle muffle thump worst acoustics ever in a theater style venue it s too bad phoenix does nt have a good medium sized venue for popular acts i have seen dcfc and arcade fire at comerica these acts would have been great but the soundacoustics were terrible i have gone back hoping it was just an isolated show but nope comerica sounds bad bad bad
i do a lot of costume work on cars and boats and mainly shopped at this establishment because it was on the way home almost every time i purchased something on sale it never rang up correctly at the front desk and the only reason i know this is because i would only buy something that was on sale their prices are extremely inflated it was not surprising to pay x as much for an item i have no clue how this place is still in business maybe there are enough people that do nt care about value to keep this place going
it is hard for me to write negative reviews but this one was easy the price was expensive and the hotel was cheap long walk to room and the bed was not that comfortable when i asked about getting a discount for military i was informed that we were lucky to be getting it at because they usually charge and it is high season in scottsdale then they charge you for everything but it was especially annoying to be told that if i just checked email i would be charged got nachos from the outside patio and they were filled with gristle and fat yuck we were supposed to stay for three nights and we moved to the best western superstition springs inn and suites and had a wonderful room and a great breakfast for i was going to just chalk it up except i just received an email from their customer service department and dave horton global head  hilton hilton hotels i decided he was a day late and a dollar short asking if we were happy there perhaps the staff should have mentioned to him that we asked for tea bags and they were going to charge us gimme a break it was noisy in the rooms at night as well as the conference rooms during the day i am going to write a glowing report on the best western superstition springs inn so watch for that one then you will know that i am usually a nice person who is easy to get along with
this review is not a review of the store but of att wireless service in general att is the worst wireless service i ve ever had i have more dropped calls and less bars in more places than any other carrier i ve had and i ve had verizon tmobile lrb the best rrb and now att i would have never switched service if i did nt have to in order to get my iphone and for the record the iphone is the best object i ve ever owned i recommend you avoid att wireless at all costs lrb unless you want the best phone in the world only then is it worth it rrb
in the world of cakes there s somehow an unspoken rule that if it s pretty it s okay to be subpar in taste and moistness in my world this does not compute it needs to be as tasty as it is pretty period so i can only give kudos to the artfulness of a tammie coe cake but nothing more cakes where you are told to remove the fondant and then eat it that s not right  you should be able to eat it all  and yummily so if you like the taste of fondant you ve got to be kidding me  yucky so take my review or leave it i just think a cake needs to be tasty and moist first and pretty second less of course it s for a wedding than it needs to be both equally who has ever said no to an ugly but great tasting cake  not me so i m putting my foot down and saying i wo nt eat a cake or cupcake that is nt tasty to me now i must state that i am more a fan of cake than frosting frosting is secondary to me so if you are more for frosting than for cake ignore my note and have at all the tammie coe s and sprinkles of the world  and have mine no really go ahead if there is frosting  for me and others like me a little bit of frosting goes a long way with one exception if it s whipped cream frosting then bring it on i like frosting s more subtler relative so if it s a whipped cream iced cake i wo nt make it a point to get an inside piece or scrape off the icing at all as i would a basic frosted cake anyway tammie coe s cakes or cupcakes do nt do it for me if i have to partake in one of her treats i d shoot for her pastries or cookies before cake or cupcake as for mj bread i have no complaints there their breads really impressed i ca nt remember which cenpho restaurant i had my first taste of mj bread but i remember being v e r y impressed
i was really p d off i was on a date and the girl didnt take my date s order and kept telling me it bucks for my sandwich and a coke honestly when is bucks a good deal it isnt i actually had to tell her to also take his order and that he was treating i mean how embarrassing i love the chicken walnut but the people are too young and inexperienced here
please please yelp stop forcing reviewers to award one star when not only does a place deserve zero stars but actually should receive a minus rating the metro phoenix area has an abundance of very attractive hole golf courses and then there is this poor excuse even worse in my opinion it is dangerous and attempting to negotiate one s way around it is risking a sprained or broken ankle thanks to the abundance of prairie dog holes littering the unkempt fairways having risen early in order to play holes before the temperature got too hot i gritted my teeth and worked my way around this disaster my wife however looked over those rodent holes and decided she was safer sitting in the cart so declined to play lrb even though she had paid rrb speaking of green fees one might expect adobe dam to offer very low fees due to its condition but dream on last week of may plus for cart the course is poorly marked  one can not tell from the tee box which hole one is about to play and the course layout on the scorecard was difficult to decipher i would never visit this place again and highly recommend readers look elsewhere to play a round of golf
i try and i try and i try to like this place but the only thing fleming s does consistently is let me down simply said our shrimp appetizers came out sans deveining yes the digestive track of the shrimp were right there for us to see next my veal chop came out raw raw cold and uncooked in the center i sent it back twice and finally just gave up amateur hour again to their defense i had an amazing steak at the dayton ohio location but at least four other locations have let me down sigh
very disappointed on our last visit prefer the tempe location for both customer service and food we were celebrating my wife s birthday after waiting for more than an hour on the patio in the heat we learned that the prime rib was sold out the waiter was great lrb don rrb but the manager was poor when asked a service question will not visit this location in future back to tempe food was over seasoned too salty
i wonder what samples jan d received  if they had given me samples it would have saved me because i would have run out the door right after the first bite i think the place everyone else ate at has been replaced and i found myself at the new chino bandido a shit dump that serves food that tastes worse than if a panda express threw up on del taco i should have known this would be a disaster if guy fieri has been here when is his minutes up  every time i go somewhere that guy fieri has featured on diners driveins and dives it always turns out to be one of the worst places i have ever been guy fieri knows as much about food as mcdonalds does first i did nt even get what i ordered they make a huge deal about how to order how about getting the order right  what they gave me could nt have been more opposite to what i ordered i ordered black beans and plain fried rice they gave me refried beans and pork fried rice or some fried rice that was contaminated with a pseudo disgusting meatlike product i ordered a jade red burrito they gave me something with slimy pork inside and i asked for a veggie quesadilla they gave me a quesadilla with gross fatty chicken and a horrible sauce the bag was filled with grease even on the bottom of it it made a bag from five guys look healthy i guess for some it is a novelty to mix asian and mexican if you really want to enjoy such fusion head to vegas and try china poblano the creation of jose andres if you are drunk or high between the hours of am and pm and in phoenix and you have a need to consume a pile of shit this place will satisfy such a craving
looked online for a laptop and checked availability i called this store to double check before driving min i got here and they did nt have either one i also remember having issues returning something here about two years ago and it was a nightmare
so i ve heard everyone rave about this place but every time we ve come here there is always at least an hour wait so we decided to come early today to avoid a wait only to be told that they do not do outdoor seating or takeout on the weekends lrb our dog was with us and we were not going to leave him in the car rrb we tried to be flexible but it was like they did nt care for our business looks like it was never meant to be they did nt even try to offer an explanation for their policy do nt think i ll try to eat here again not worth paying for a pizza when the service is not worth it
last time i went in the girl told me oh hold on there s a note on your file oh it says i ca nt validate your parking wow just in case there was any confusion over how to to treat their members thank goodness there was a note in my file to make me feel extra special ps she was sweet and made sure to stamp that validation anyhow thanks awesome front desk girl rrb
no shade  no grass  no dogs  no water   no fun
i have been shopping at various fascinations over the years and its always a great experience with the staff this company has done a great job recreating the image and feel of a sex shop and mainstreamed the whole experience however my issues sits with this one location as i have now had two bad experiences at this store this weekend we my girlfriend and i stopped by to pick up a mask for her mother who was going to a halloween party that evening they had a large selection of mascaraed masks so we took a picture and texted the one we liked to her mother out of no where this beast of a slob comes running out literally yelling at us that we ca nt take pictures in pure shock of the situation i asked lrb genuine curiosity not being a dick rrb why we ca nt send a picture text of the product she proceeds to talk down to me by explaining that i m in a sex shop as if i was and did nt know shit from shit lol so we went on there website and texted the same image from there as if anything was different by doing that the dumb bitch was satisfied and i was turned off to spending anymore money or time in this place i just took the mask and checked out where they proceeded to try to up sell me on every fucking product in the store great sales model offend the customer then beg them to buy shit they do nt want i would spend money with this business in the future but never at this location as i have now gone for with bad customer service here i wish i caught her name because the other girl working was very nice
this is the worst hotel i have ever stayed at we ve been here nights and had to change rooms times the problem with the first room was that the door was to difficult to open the second room was nt much better the battery in the smoke detector needed to be replaced because it beeped all night the bath tub water only got luke warm the electrical outlets are not at all secure and not every lamp had a light bulb also the second room did nt have a fridge  microwave and we paid for one i m in the third room now omg the toilet keeps backing up so we had to get a plunger this entire room is unsanitary we can either plug in the fridge microwave or tv but not all three at least there s hot water they are a little lax on the housekeeping as well i m not in the habit or writing negative reviews but our experience here has been nightmarish
we were greeted at the door and the host was nice but as soon as we sat down the service just stopped after literally minutes we decided to leave due to no one acknowledging us without even the slightest smile the food looked decent but we will never know and due to the lack of service we will never return if you are looking for a place to be treated as if you do nt exist then mellow mushroom is the place for you
wow sad and dismal letdown both in food and in service i was on a hop out to la and had a bit of time to kill food was a great idea as the stomach was empty and my reserve light was on that could only mean i had a one hr max to find fuel or shut the engine down enter the th fairway wow it looked good from the outside had a golf feel to it sure why not thought the man who was desperate well i should have focused on the not and i do heavily emphasize the why the sandwich was dismal and service even worse never have i had a burger that limp downtrodden or beaten up the onion rings were more like overcooked batter next time i m shutting down the motor faced with the same choice of hunger pangs or th fairway now i know why they invented snickers
i went by this location for lunch today only to see a big closed sign by the entrance other cars came in too so i m assuming it recently shut down i had lunch there weeks ago the sign said that the gilbert location was still open
what the hell happened to this place  i used to love chino bandido their wacky mexicanasian combos seemed to give me consistent mouthgasms every time i d go there within the past year or so however something changed the staff went way downhill and the resulting food that comes out of the kitchen is a sad and pathetic shadow of what it used to be just to illustrate this point i decided to give this place another shot a few weeks ago and upon walking in lrb the place was empty by the way rrb i was greeted with a wassup by the main kid at the register nothing more than that just wassup with a look on his face like i was a rival gang member entering into hostile territory not very welcoming to say the least after ordering my combo dish  to go i was treated to about a minute wait and while i was waiting the three kids working in the kitchen were rapping with each other some of the words coming from their mouths are probably too harsh to include in this review it was obvious that they were paying no attention to my food that was cooking it was so uncomfortable to be sitting there that long staring at a group of clueless kids making fools out of themselves i almost walked out without my food even though i had already paid  because let s be honest the chance of this food being decent at this point was near zero in my mind after my long wait and being handed my bad of food by one of the delinquentlooking employees lrb who by the way did nt mutter a single word when giving me my dish or when i left rrb i went home to uncover what horrors awaited me in that styrofoam container let me just tell you my friends it was not pretty it looked like someone had taken an ice cream scooper and just plopped a pile of beans on top of a soggy tortilla and rice then put in on the floor and stepped on it it was a mushy pile of greased up nothingness no substance just a poor excuse for a pile of food that could be mistaken for animal excrement by no means should you go here unless they revitalize this place or hire some new staff so this is your warning  avoid the chandler location like the plague
god why did i ever go back  i had low expectations coming here again because of what it was like the last time but this time it was worse we sat in these seats which reeked of bo and had to move several times to a seat that was nt nasally offensive wtf
i hesitated to write this i mean everyone has a bad day but in the end my disgust and frustration won out on  my son and i dined at this location the young man at the counter  alex  was super nice and friendly unfortunately the rest of our visit was less than stellar about half way through our meal three kids lrb around age or so rrb came in a got water cups from someone behind the counter these kids spend over minutes at the soda machine tasting every possible concoction of soft drink rinsing their cups under the fountain then wiping them out with napkins they left on the counter i finally got up to say something to tom the manager when one of the boy started washing under the water dispenser despite the boys being there over minutes at this point he claim he had nt seen anything his response to my complaint and concern  rrb no kids come behind the counter so it s ok rrb i m not there parents we ll clean it up later to tom lrb and popeye s rrb i say this  no you are not there parents what you are is a manager our a facility that serves food to the public you have a duty with that job to make sure the place is kept as clean as possible which includes asking people to leave if needed our bill was just over these kids spend hope they come back with their parents to eat because you wo nt be getting our business again i have also filed a complaint with the maricopa county department of environmental services 
cafe crapas another mediocre sandwich shop best suited for cheap office catering
their pharmacy is both accusatory and ignorant they question you about your purchases to the point that they might as well just come out and ask you if you are a drug user i understand that there are rules to follow but it can be done professionally and employed through common customer service skills simple questions like oh your a diabetic what kind of insulin do you use or so can you tell me a little about why you need the longer needles rather than literally arguing with us for several minutes about the purchase of insulin supplies and accusing their customer of being a heroin junkie professionalism fail knowledge of medicine fail customer service fail if there were an option for no stars at all i would have taken it i will never go back to another walmart again after the way we were treated here
this place was filthy oh my gosh it looked like the aftermath of a food fight  bagel chunks and crumbs all over the floor i wo nt get started on the bathroom it was so disgusting the owner the bagel man himself was too busy chatting with another employee to greet me or wait on me a nice lady from the kitchen had to come out and help apparently though nobody but the owner is allowed to handle the money so he finally broke off his conversation and rang up the sale i did nt like the way he treated the nice lady and i was troubled by the way she seemed overly deferential to him and almost frightened bagels are okay but nothing special would not go back if the customer are is that dirty what can the kitchen be like 
very disappointed in thier lack of customer service i called and left a message a week later i am still waiting for a returned call
never again worst school i ve been to in my life in my middle school years i went here got bullied endlessly office never did anything about it do nt waste your time here
not very vegetarian friendly food is not made fresh to order so they could not accommodate me then had to other three sides each and one side still came with meat nice and friendly staff and good margaritas but i will not be back
i am sorry i heard great things about gg so took the family to the arrowhead location in glendale az the service was good iced tea was fresh sake price for happy hour was a great deal but i was very disappointed with the cleanliness there was food everywhere and i felt it unsanitary to even get the chicken when i saw the tongs had actually fallen into the container the people behind me asked for more marinated steak because all you saw was a red liquid the guy brought it out and said more meat less blood lrb his words exactly rrb i almost gagged also the meat station smelled awful fresh meat and seafood should not have a foul odor and you should be able to tell what kind of meat it is only the turkey looked decent the carrots were brown and a lot of the veggies looked limp the mushrooms looked like they needed to be washed i feel the place would benefit if they just cleaned it up and put out fresh food and more variety of sauces that are not so salty most of them tasted the same with a sodium overload i do nt understand this when you have all the dry salt powders near the meat station then load up on salty sauce  now being half thai i love asian food my mom used to own an award winning thai restaurant back in the day before thai exploded everywhere i did not come here for gourmet food i came because i heard it was fresh and i could get exactly the ratio of veggies and meat to noodles that i wanted and it was open late i guess in all fairness we went around pm so after the dinner rush but still no excuse to not wipe down the food area afterall they are open till pm
not that impressed maybe i should have read other reviews from google lrb httpmapsgooglecommapsplacehlensafestrictumieutfqsuntownfbglushqsuntowncid rrb regardless i took two white shirts and black capris in both shirts came back with stains still on them i mention this because i took them to another cleaner and the stains were gone again not impressed lrb
used to always go to this location and moved on to another place decided to try it again after buying a groupon now i know why they are putting out groupons the service was very poor they treated me very badly as i presented them the groupon my car still had dirt inside finger print on the passenger side rear window from my daughter lrb because they did nt do the windows rrb the windshield was missed and there were bugs on the front of the car still the tires still the dirt all over them i asked if the car should be run back through and the gentleman did nt understand what i was saying because he did nt speak english just kept wiping it down i will not be back it s not work the very unfortunate because they were awesome and the main manager and the ones they had before were just wonderful
they advertise you do nt need no teeth to eat our meat well yes you do i bought a full rack of baby backs and could nt wait to get home with them they were very tough and had very little meat on them
let me start this by saying i am a mom of young kids needless to say i do nt have the biggest nightlife because parenting at am with a hang over is just not worth it that being said i ve never had cause to visit a wendy s at am until tonight i ve been up all night with my year old son who is sick i thought a frosty would soothe his throat and do just the trick to get him back to sleep but all i got was a foomy version of one from them plus shitty cold food if their food is going to suck at am then do nt be open that late
service was terrible the server was nice but not very efficient if you want a better alternative to this same style of food try out yc s genghis grill not only does nt taste as good as yc s but the portions are smaller and you are required to have a server you must tip overall yc s is the better bang for your buck and tastes quite a bit better
we got food poisoning from coming here the wait was long the food average and a night of praying to the porcelain god made this whole thing a terrible experience
we were in the area and decided to stop here for a late lunch when we entered there were several people waiting in the front area but the dining area was less than  full after standing unnoticed for several minutes we were just about to walk out when a hostess apologized for the wait and informed us that there are not enough servers to serve the entire dining area so there would be about a min wait no problem so we sat in the waiting area with the others after a couple seconds i could nt help but notice the extremely highpitched continuous noise coming from the kitchen equipment as much as i tried to block it out i found myself getting almost an instant headache which is quite rare for me it was at this instant that i decided this just was nt worth the wait no matter how good the food is so we left and went to chili s a couple doors down rrb
i will have to pass after many good reviews from friends and other individuals my fiancee and i went here for dinner the service was incredibly slow lrb it was nt a busy night rrb and the food was nothing to rave about i got the ribs and it was tough and chewy edit  in response to joanna s comment i thought i d post my email response to her in further detail of my experience i figured the further detail might be helpful to other yelpers as well the food was adequate i had the ribs which seemed rather tough and chewy typically i am most forgiving when it comes to food and would be happy to return to try another entree  just because i might not enjoy one meal does nt meant i ca nt enjoy another however the deal breaker would have to be the service at the restaurant the wait staff took way to long of time to come back lrb after we requested a moment to look over the menu rrb we had someone else who worked there passing by to get our waitress the wait on our food after our order was a bit long roughly more than  minutes and our waitress never came back to refill our drinks or checked back on us after we asked for our refill when we got our bill our waitress took too long in fact my fiancee got up from our table to find anyone to help us pay for the bill 
last week a group of us went into the mellow mushroom restaurant in tempe to have a quick lunch before a pm meeting we got there at noon ordered and then waited and waited and waited at pm i told my waitress that i had a pm meeting and please run my card now so i can take my food and run to my meeting well i get my food at pm and it is the wrong order argghhh so i have the waitress send it back to the kitchen and have one of my coworkers bring it to me but i am still waiting for my card which i gave to her minutes ago and i have to go this meeting that i am already late for my coworker signs my card and i get my cold food later and again it s the wrong order i eat it anyways and ca nt lie it tasted really good fast forward to today where a coworker and i had another pm meeting we decide to work through lunch and order take out from them and give them another chance i make our orders at pm and the girl says that it will take minutes so i go to pick them up at pm and they are nt ready so again i wait and wait and wait while i am waiting i hear the kitchen manager and a server talking about a table where the customer was not so happy about having to wait so long for their food and was trying to get a discount at that moment i hear the kitchen manager refer to the customer that is arguing this as a douchebag my jaw just dropped at what i have just heard i have to go outside because i do nt wanna hear more so i continue to wait until i get our food at pm minutes after it was promised to me we end up having to eat our food during our meeting uggh now the food is great here they do an great job at this but the customer service is absolutely dreadful and that is being nice surprising because there is usually people working in there at one time i do not recommend mellow mushroom unless you have a lot of time and patience and do nt mind the kitchen staff calling you douchebag and other names behind your back i ll pass
seriously  shut up this place blows would nt last minutes in ny i ll bet the vegas store does nt last either this place insults the pizza
omg hands down the worst chinese food i ve ever had anywhere stopped by for lunch with my wife i ordered their cashew chicken dish and my wife ordered the pad thai noodles with shrimp barely edible makes panda express look like gourmet chinese food prior to flo s the distinction of the worst chinese food went to a chinese restaurant in nebraska but that s nebraska i m chinese and live in san francisco so know a thing or two about good chinese food
formerly a favorite definitely gone downhill primarily due to managers who seem to feel like they are doing you a favor by allowing you to spend your money and oh yes its a lot of money you want a real irish pub go to casey moore s and skip the attitude
need more front office staff horrible customer service both on the phone and in person both my appointments were mins late one of my appointments they told me they were running about hour behind one person waiting told me that he was waiting hour for just to get heartworm medicine everyone waiting seems really annoyed and you can tell they have been waiting a long time or they have not even been helped at all my nd appointment i refused to wait hour past my appointment time i told the front office lady that i was not able to wait she was very smug with me and told me there was nothing she could do so i walked out my first appointment my dog need to get some stitches out so whisked her away leaving me in the waiting area and in mins brought her back and said they took them out saying everything looks good there was no talking to the veterinarian is the veterinarian even looking at my dog  i dont care how small my dogs cut is im paying you for all my visits and for a vet especially running a hour behind yup dont think she looked at him i was really annoyed the staff seems like they over book patients lrb obviously rrb and i see all the parents in the waiting area doesnt seem to be any use of the exam rooms or interaction much with the veterinarian from what i see i am disappointed because this vet is close to the home but i much rather drive twice as far to have a on time appointment with a nicer more personable staff i do not recommend banfield hospital especially the one in surprise i will def be finding a nice neighborhood vet
my wife and i finally stopped in to margaritaville this last thursday since we had passed it by every time we are at west gate we walked up to there hostess station and there were three of them standing there talking amongst themselves with there back turned to us i took a moment but they finally realized we were standing there silly girls so we were seated and our server came over and asked us if we would like some drinks my wife ordered water but had to change to lemonade because the water tasted bad i had the tea it was fine there server came back over and took our orders and got the lemonade i had the shrimp pasta with andouille and pepper in a cajun cream sauce and the wife ordered the mahi mahi with pineapple salsa and rice my pasta had to be to most bland tasting food i have ever had no flavor pasta with butter would have tasted better the garlic toast was the best part my wife s fish was also bland and lacked any real cajun spice and the pineapple salsa looked like they opened a can of pineapple chunks and tossed it on the fish and called it salsa they were also very slow and filling drinks it sucked we wont go back this is the kind of service i would expect from a grand opening or something so left margaritaville and went to the yard house for drinks and hung out there for about three hours and enjoyed pizza during reverse happy hour it helped save the night since margaritaville sucked so bad
ordered food and never got it
okay so i actually joined yelp so i could comment on this business i purchased an amazon local coupon which the owner refused to accept instead i was offered to purchase a tanning package for dollars i am unsure why the owner would sign up for the amazon deal if she was unwilling to accept the voucher it was a huge waste of my time not only did i drive out there to redeem my voucher but i also had to return home and call amazon to receive a refund for the voucher i purchased it is a very poor way to run a business and is a quick way to alienate customers even though it is down the street from my house i will not be returning
i would give less than star if possible ordered lunch to go for a group and we arrived to pick up we were told by the bartender that the order had been canceled as they got busy between the time we ordered and drove over to pick up he may as well burned cash on the bar we will not be returning and had our group lunch at another establishment that actually wants business try another place for burgers there is a wineburger on th st and bethany that rocks
very dated rooms and decor also friday night clientele is rather sleazy it is right next to tequila willys that should say it all
this place gave me the runs literally straight to the bathroom after i ate this slop i should have known better my spidey senses was telling me to leave but no i stayed just because i ve been craving jonesing for caribbean food so i placed my order i had curry chicken rice and peas and cabbage i declined the plantains it seemed the flies enjoyed it better than me they were having a blast swarming over the plantains i paid something like which in my opinion was too much considering the proportions do nt match the price the taste was just ok not the worst but not the best either the cabbage was pretty good though the food seemed old too if i had to bet that food probably was cooked yesterday cause the kitchen did not look cooked in i feel like a sucka reading these damn reviews thinking i was gonna get a good meal i do nt know where the hell these folks who left reviews ate at it sure as hell does nt seems like its this place maybe i came at the wrong time my st time sucked and my bubbling stomach thinks so too thumbs down and a wtf
this place is extremely sub par for a place that specializes in tacos i m pretty sure that they use canned chicken for their tacos  burritos and london broiled lowgrade beef lrb which they try to pass of as carne asada rrb all in all i could make their menu at home and have it taste better the prices are cheap so i guess that you get what you pay for  however i could get a much better tasting burrito at chipotle or a local filiberto s type of restaurant for the same price i ve given this place two chances to change my mind and my feelings have only solidified
dont let the price of fool you the food here was horrible it was either way over cooked or not cooked enough they also dont seem to care about appearence as the seats were torn lastly they dont have the ac very low making the whole experience swampy and hot
hi  i m cuban and went here mid week last year my husband wanted to treat me to my favorite food sorry this was not only a major disappointment but the place is an old pizza hut with dirty walls and questionable food did not enjoy this experience at all we need good cuban food in phoenix until then i will be heading to nyc or miami nice try
what a brutal dining experience in my many many years of dining out i have never experienced such terrible unfriendly and unwelcoming service we walked in to the restaurant and it had a distinct odor much like that of natural gas we hoped for the best and definitely got the worst from the moment we sat down my friend and i were assaulted by murderous glances from the owner was it because we brought our children to dine in his establishment  how dare we  we had to ask for bread drinks napkins a couple of times before receiving them the waitress was overwhelmed and not too kind either the food came out in waves not all together as you would expect when dining in a restaurant the adult s food arrived at least minutes before the children s you d think it would be the opposite the food was actually quite good yet not good enough to overcome the terrible discomfort that we felt being in this restaurant truly i would have felt more welcome in mcdonald s in this economy you should welcome each and every paying customer into your restaurant with open arms or at least a smile a little kindness goes a long way
so disappointed with babbo our family has been going there since it opened up the pizza is amazing and i love the salads unfortunately they only receive one star based on our most recent experience we picked up a pizza and brought it home when we lifted the pizza lid our pizza was so sad looking it looked like someone forgot to add the sauce and we probably had about ounces of cheese sparsely sprinkled on top we called babbo and spoke with the manager he said there was nothing he could do unless we drove back to the restaurant we live about minutes away and asked if they could mail a credit or credit our debit card the answer was no so sad i love the pizza but ca nt stand poor customer service especially when i have been a loyal customer
used to be a great place  not any more hair found in two of four of our breakfast dishes food was cold biscuits and gravy had weird flavor place is not as clean now either stay away
what ever happen to customer service  it seems that this term and banking lrb at least with chase rrb are not allowed to exist within their walls i had a deposit eaten by the atm on sunday march and today tuesday the acting manager and csr told me they only count the machine once a week on thursdays kinda makes you scratch your head and go hummmm what else can i say 
the one time i came here for myself my arizona brown spider bite was diagnosed as a staff infection either way i would have gotten antibiotics but the misdiagnosis turned me off from this hospitals expertise especially after a friend who is an army medic and an ems team diagnosed it right
do nt get me i love sport clips it s my favorite hair cut place but when we came to this one the manager was very rude and had an unpleasent attitude i gave it one star for my last visit
worst sushi i ve ever had yellowtail sashimi was served like nigiri without the rice  pieces of fish waaaayyy too thick  wasabi was dry and flavorless  completely not fresh  dragon roll was nothing more than crab mix w  unagi and avocado on top  lame  and overpriced lost our name on the seating list and was sooooo not worth the wait  when complained to the manager he made it seem like our fault that the sushi was so terrible i thought the customer was always right the only thing this place has going for it is location and stupid local scottsdale yuppies that ca nt tell the different between fresh quality fish and garbage extremely disappointing
horrible service and food enjoyed the manager telling the waitress to stay because they were busy and watching her complain funny thing is she passed our table several times while we sat minutes without any service
worst subway ever when trying to add my vegetables the guy helping was incredibly rude and looked annoyed that he was there and then when i asked for my sandwich wrapped in separate halves he said nothing and huffed and puffed as he wrapped he acted like i was ruining his day so rude and unprofessional i will never come to this subway again
my brother and i both got the runs after eating here we both believe it was from bad food at tee pee s
i have been waiting to try this place for a long time the building from the outside give the appearance that it looks nice on the inside i know it is call the blue burger grille but from the minute i walked in the door my eyes started hurting me everything is bright blue bright blue walls blue concrete floors blue tables even blue lightbulbs it immediately turned me off atmosphere is part of the dining experience and this place was definately lacking on the atmosphere it cost us dollars for people to eat and we only ordered soda that would have been ok if the food was amazing but everything came overcooked we ordered everything medium rare and it came medium well i didnt even bother sending it back because we couldnt wait to out of there and get away from the obnoxiously overwhelming blue interior decor
by far worst service wait staff and management in the valley poor attitude from the front of the house to manager food very average over all poor dining experience do nt waste your time can you take away stars  no never mind they do nt have any
i ve been to han machi a handful of times and decided to have my birthday party of there i made the reservation at am the day of providing my contact information at their request upon arrival the restaurant was busier than i had ever seen it and there were no tables available my party waited in the lobby for minutes after my reservation time before some guests became restless and started to leave the staff scrambled to ask other guests to move to other tables and cram us into what tables they could scoot together there was one overwhelmed waitress trying to serve the entire table dishes all came out at different times one guest was served an hour and a half before others they even brought out some mochi with a birthday candle in it for me before i received all my dinner many guests canceled their orders after waiting for two hours they did not apologize or offer to erase any items from the bill to compensate
what a bad time we had reservations for and did nt get seated until well we got seated at a temporary table until the table we were supposed to have was ready then we moved again they did nt get any of the food right some of us did nt eat at all we all left hungry my ribs were good but fatty not worth i will not be returning one star for decor
the food and service here are just poor for the high prices you pay
we were looking to join a gym recently but when we showed up to talk to someone and get a tour they wanted us to fill out these liability release forms and sign them why do we have to divulge all of our personal information including our date of birth and sign a liability release form just to get a tour  we walked out that seemed like a red flag a sneaky way to get us on some kind of spam mailing list or something no thanks we went straight to la fitness and they were happy to give us a tour right when we walked in
bad service food quality not consistant i used to get breakfast at this particular paradise but i have had consistantly bad service for the last couple times i walked in a couple weeks ago and there were customers waiting to order and no one behind the counter i waited minutes and there was still no one at the counter so i left sometimes the food was good sometimes it was very disappointing i give up on paradise too many other places with much better food and service
what an over rated plate full of grease i hate when i am eating and they come sweep under my feet i always feel like all those particles are going to go in my food service sucks way way over rated
mid century furniture is supposed to be warm welcoming and approachable not here almost every piece of furniture had a sign on it do not touch or do not sit it felt more like an overpriced museum when i asked the owner about all the signs she said i do nt go to a luxury car dealership and sit in all the cars i ca nt afford people who buy a really nice piece of furniture here do nt want something that everyone has sat their butt on i ll never waste my time there again
how does this place have such a high rating  the sandwiches are bland and unimaginative the potato salad i ordered had more onions in it than potatoes and the servers were impatient and snooty i am not a picky eater i sampled a couple of different things here and i did nt like any of it i feel like i could make a better sandwich at home for  the price which is what i would recommend doing if you re thinking about trying this place for the first time save your money nana s is too expensive for the quality of food they re offering nana s sandwich saloon come for the uncomfortable wicker furniture stay for the lackluster sandwiches
warning danger do not enter gross this place is nasty if i could give it less than a star yea i would have while out running errands over the weekend i decided to be adventurous  try a new place i had never tried so i find myself driving down indian school rd and see the chinese buffet sign i thought great because i was not sure what i wanted and with a buffet there are so many choices right  wrong the choices were not many and the food was not good the rice tasted like dirt i had some mushrooms that were good everything was labeled wrong they had fried chicken wings the size of my pinky if these came off a chicken it must have been a chick the egg foo young looked like scrambled eggs with mushrooms this place is gross we took one bite of everything on our plates and when nothing tasted good we left we told them your buffet is garbage and we left btw we did not pay for it either
given this place tries and continues to disappoint higher priced bland mexican food with so many options in the area it s not worth it
all i have to say is this place could only feed children the portions are for year olds i just got so upset when i got my food i did nt even want to eat it the taste of the food is okay but there is really no point in eating at a restaurant that can not even remotely fill you up
i truly believe this is the worst bar in arizona maybe the southwest it s soulkillingly bare and soaked in ammonia fumes the warm clutter of the former ivan s caravan has been replaced with an uneven formica bar top stripped concrete walls linoleum floors and all the ambiance of a jail cell the bartender told me they do nt provide toilet paper in the bathrooms anymore because the clientele kept stealing it ouch my soul hurts
i never got served and when i did the waitress told me that she was nt supposed to take tables yet so i grabbed my shit and left i did nt want her to work off the clock for free so i brought my business elsewhere will never be back
this is one of those companies that specializes in service via annual contracts get your wallet out dealing with empire is extremely pricey we made the mistake of calling empire when our air conditioner broke being new to the area we did nt have any local contacts and just used the yellow pages when the empire guys came they found out what was wrong and replaced a small part that i later found was something like or when ordered on the internet but for some reason by the time they added their service fee for the appx minute appointment it was considerably over then they try to get you to buy an annual contract so that you can get two free tuneups all in all i would nt trust these people to come back to my house ever they give me a creepy feeling just talking to them on the phone
closed they owed so many hard working people so much money i m thrilled that they got what was coming to them best wishes to the staff that they walked out on
why oh why is it so hard to find good chinese food in this town  the two behind the counter at this place are chinese  please do nt tell me you eat the garbage that you serve to the masses in phoenix as chinese food i should have read the previous review because i had a simple beef with vegetables lrb how could that be screwed up  rrb hardly any beef the veggies were all previously frozen the pork fried rice smelled like rotten fish the pork is cut into tiny pieces and are extremely fatty  i m not even sure it s pork i did see a dead cat not far from the front door maybe he will be on tonight s special menu  wahsun is not too far down th ave  go there instead this place sucks
this place is bad it s hard to tell what the underlying issue is i would guess poor management inexperienced ownership and bad training to start credit cards get mysteriously lost then returned at the end of the night days later erroneous charges appear on statments bouncers act like they re the keepers of the keg cup at a frat party and are overly aggressive as bad as the library was this place is much worse
i was invited to an event here for channelingmeditation i agree with all the other post  the grounds emit a peaceful atmosphere and great energy abounds but all that good feeling came crashing down when a woman from the church huffed into the area and very rudely let it be known that we were not welcome there the funny thing  i was the only one there i was waiting for the group of people who had just arrived geez talk about being made to feel lke i somehow personally offended this person the person coordinating the event told me she and others met on the grounds all the time and never had a problem who knows what this woman s problem was that day all i know is i will never step foot in that place again
wife and i went to t f today at lunch intent on corned beef and cabbage lrb me rrb and fried fish lrb her rrb waiter told us we could have the all you can eat fish for only dollars more than the regular fish we took the regular fish what she got was either a very small piece of fish or half of a regular sized one was fried up in a salty bit of batter came with good cole slaw but there was only about two teaspoons of it also came with some overcooked limp and greasy french fries all for my corned beef was good small portion again but good the cabbage was so salty that it might have been cooked in brine fortunately there was only about tablespoons of it it also came with mashed potatoes which were good but again super small portions my meal was also iced tea was and harp beer lrb small glass rrb was not too bad chef needs to learn how big a serving size is he ca nt tell the difference between regular serving sizes and children s sizes hint every day they have a different special that special is the big that is to say regular size for only a few bucks more so order the special even if it sounds big cause it is nt you ll actually save money because after we paid over bucks we still went over to near by carvers because we were still hungry very sorry i did nt have the same experience that some of my fellow yelpers did i guess this is a beer drinking place and food comes secondary
i have made a reservation for of my lady friends i talked to the owner of the restaurant in person several times and on the phone and planned the event to fine details everything was perfect morning of not afternoon first thing in the morning i called the restaurant to let them know that of my guests were not going to make it back in town and as a result will not attend my event i was assured that it will not be a problem and that the server will relate the message to the owner owner was not available at the time here are my honest complains that i even wanted to tell the owner know but she refused to listen i was told without even asking that for a reservation of guests the restaurant will be reserved and available for us from pm to pm i have called to give a final number of guests to avoid being overcharged the attitude of the owner was not acceptable here is what happened the restaurant was not ready for us at pm it was more like pm i did not say anything at the time the restaurant was not closed for the public which resulted me personally and others to sit on a patio chair very uncomfortable my reservation was not for outside but inside i was still charged for the maximum guest which means that pretty much the fact that i called with a final number of guest attending did not make a difference for the owner of course it meant less money in her packet i was told that she did the shopping for the restaurant and that was it what is that supposed to mean  i was also told that she was there to wash her dishes late and therefore there is not a refund for the overcharge what is that suppose to mean  i asked am i supposed to cover out of my pocket the charge after bringing her business and great business in her restaurant  and that was pretty much it the owner only cared for her profit pocket and no costumer service hello we are in the usa here rrb the hats are gross and a mess and i asked if she plans to have more or in better condition for the event and i was told that they are donated and that she is open for more donations lol my guests all had their own hats if health department will look at the hats they may have something to say about their condition and weather they are safe for the public use the place is small but nicely decorated food great and staff great but having this experience left me in a position that i told the owner i will make sure all my guest and more know of her restaurant she does not deserve our money we pay her bills and her employees by being there her response was it is your choice
when i called to ask the hours the owner snapped and said who is this  when i showed up she made us sit in the parking lot in july while she locked up her dog then proceeded to tell us that she was gonna kick us out after i told her i was just browsing then she told me i would be the last customer ever because she s closing down to turn it into a bmovie screening theater due to people like me who just browse and waste her time according to another review she said the same thing to someone else over a year ago my boyfriend asked if her new business would be friendlier lrb lol rrb and she said no in fact worse horrible customer service horribly disorganize no wares of interest smelled like dog and mothballs and the owner is rude  insane
i went to the location in gilbert was not impressed at all thought i was going to have to visit the dentist after eating there the bread was so tough left with a wtf feeling and realized i should ve went next door to culvers
overrated overpriced and where s the filling tastes like flavorless boxedcake with sugary frosting ca nt believe the owner judges cupcake wars and does nt change her recipe i want some filling in the middle with a ganache icing for that price lines out the door i do nt get it
ok was just wondering what happened to alternative rock at this station  all i hear is classic rock now so disappointing seriously and ca nt get on the website either i was a huge listener until now no alternative rock way uncool
i once got a fortune cookie with no fortune in it there were two ways to interpret this rrb i had no fortune lrb true at the time rrb or rrb nothing in bed lrb also true at the time rrb
the quality of yogurt is same as other location but the toppings are quite less then other orange leaf location the main reason for star is customer service the owner seems to be very unhappy when asked about spoonsmall paper cups for testing i have nt seen this kind of resistance at any other yogurt shop even though i live nearby i prefer to go to other orange leaf location purely because of customer service
we went here because it was recommended by the locals and had good reviews in the tour guide book the patio was neat with fun decorations the mexican food was average the salsa was too watery just a little heat to it the guacamole was good it was creamy with small chunks of avocado in it the pinto beans tasted like they came out of a can one plus is they have pitchers of beer and margaritas the one star is for the staffservice they were slow moving and never came back to the table to check on us after we got our food it felt like we were inconveniencing them they did nt give us a refill on the chips until we asked two different servers mind you it was a small plastic basket to begin with we were not total pigs i paid an extra for the guacamole the least they could do was bring me some chips with it i would pass on the food hang out at the bar for a beer to get the atmosphere and move on i would have been happier with the food and service at the baja grill across the street
do nt waste your time visiting scottsdale az and heard about jimmy woo s  a new chinese place several locals mentioned sounded like it would be worth a try stopped in for lunch place was busy but not crazy we got seated promptly and then waited and waited and waited no glass of water no drink order no wait staff at all stopping by several wait staff made eye contact from a distance and then studiously ignored us people who came in after us got seated got waited on but not us service of the poorest kind we finally just got up and left bottom line  the service sucks i wo nt be going back and i do nt recommend anyone waste their time with jimmy woo s sure some folks might just write it off as growing pains of a new place  but if the management ca nt train their wait staff it s not my problem and it s not my job to give them second chances i eat out enough to know that i do nt need to waste my time or my friend s time with poor service consider my one star rating a generous gift
another overpriced overconceptualized underwhelming fox restaurant service was by a bunch of attractive poorly trained and confused kids when i asked what type of bread my sandwich would be served upon i was told health bread whatever that means condescending healthy concept i could have forgiven all this if the food were good but it was all bland and illconceived what a disappointment
run away i was looking for spinning classes and this place looks so nice that i decided to give it a try set up and appointment with a sales rep brad and i told him that i had to try the spinning class before enrolling and that i d give him a call if i decided to join this guy said that i could not do it over the phone because there were some paperwork to fill out so i did my mistake was giving this assh my credit card number and my email after that day i kept receiving junk emails from this place to per day i had to email the general manager times before i could stop the junk emails and of course i let them know i was not going to join the club because the spinning class so the most boring class i ever have attented if it can be called spinning anyway the emails stpped for a while and suddenly today i have a charge in my account for and of course im sure fkng brad got his commision also they promised per month probably they have charged me for yrs dont go they are thieves and the classes are not worth the money they ask for
i ve had a couple of bad experiences at this store over the last months and will not be returning in particular the last time i was there i dropped off a battery to see if it could be recharged it was late on a saturday so they told me i d have to leave it overnight and that they would call me the next day as it could take as long as a few hours after half of sunday had gone by i had nt heard from them so i gave them a call it turns out nobody put the battery in the charger so they assured me in hours i could come pick it up i did nt want to drive down tot he store unless the battery was done so when i called the very unfriendly person on the phone did nt know what the status was and that they would call once they found out another hours went by and nothing by this point i was going to have to go on monday to pick up my battery anyway when i finally was told the battery was done it turned out the battery could nt hold a charge anyway they were smart enough to not ask me if i wanted to buy a new one
how disappointing my last visit here and it was entirely attributed to the staff these two girls lrb new since my last visit there rrb work there who have no concept of waiting on people let alone running a business they seemed more interested in chatting with their friends hanging out there then servicing customers i sat there for ten minutes and neither of them bothered to even acknowledge me what a shame that the good food and drink and nice ambience of the place has been ruined by an incompetent staff it was like the place has been taken over by high schoolers too many other wine bars are out there that provide consistent customer service for me to bother returning to this place ever again
this is a warning about this company which seems to also be connected with md labs and some sort of supplement called the stuff it is a fraud how do i know  because if you try to take advantage of their customer satisfaction guarantee guess where your request for a refund goes  that would be straight to my po box i am not affiliated with these people whatsoever and if you have been ripped off by them i suggest contacting your better business bureau i have had my current box for over three years and as of yet they have not changed the information on their labels as for your refund requests any that are sent to my box are promptly destroyed it is sad that you are being ripped off by this company but it is also sad that you are gullible enough to believe their outrageous claims on their products when if you read the fine print on the label it even admits that it s bs so save your money and seriously think twice about ever falling for herbal supplement claims you re just throwing your money down a black hole and potentially damaging what health you may have
unless you like hanging out a frat house this place is not for you there were fights in the hallway drunk people yelling all night long doors slamming starting at pm until  am we complained to the management only for them to shrug their shoulders as if to say yes we hear this all of the time the maid service does not even begin to clean your room until pm so we could not even get into our room to get ready for dinner unless you are age  this is not the hotel for you the firesky hotel sanctuary resort even the hilton hotel in scottsdale are far better
we decided to branch out of our south mill lunch routine and hit up ra for specifically for their lunch specials and previous speedy service and walked into one of the most baffling service experiences ever some of us ordered sushi  which came out quite fast others ordered other lunch specials that took anywhere between  minutes to come out  if at all when percent of our group had their food lrb minutes into our trip rrb the server asked are you missing anything  looking at the two gentlemen who did not receive their food yet and she asked what did you order again  when they told her she replied with would you like me to go check on that  at which point most of us were done and ready for the checks  so one decided to for go eating altogether figuring it would take another minutes and the other requested that his food which was on its way out be boxed up to go the checking out process continued to take quite some time due to tickets needing to be corrected and the togo food was nt up yet finally  minutes later the food lrb that had been delivered to the table rrb was now boxed up and ready  so we headed out when we arrived back at the office the boxed up lunch was in fact incorrect all in all the food was good  the quality for the price of the lunch was good  but the service was ridiculous
 skip this loony bin       owner or management yelling at staff member       more yelling different staff member we put our menus down my wife and i walked out why would anyone desire to dine in an asylum  my ethics my standards every business starts with one star getting more has to be earned
i definitely will not be running back to this restaurant if you can call it that i understand that when i got there that it was pretty late but the place was nt empty and about to close so i do expect good service first of all it took waaaay too long to get anyone to notice that we had sat down at one of thieir booths our dumb waitress jennifer was barely around and we could nt tell if she was our waitress or the dumb brunette there that could not stop giving us dirty looks the manager i think he was could nt stop being a huge douche about the fact that i was the only underage person there he went out of his way to come by our table and say oh yeah your waitress asked if i had checked your ids before when you came to the bar for a drink so i made sure to let her know that you lrb points rrb at me were the underage one well thanks you asshole but pretty sure i ordered a god damn coke and not a beer when we had gone to the bar before hand for a drink i asked for a coke lrb this bar is about a seater so you can see everything rrb and he got everyone their alcoholic drinks and left me without a drink even though i was sitting directly in front of his work area pretty sure you can see that my drink coaster is without a drink now to tell you about the horrible food that came out cold the spinach dip was discusting too did nt have any silverware napkins or side plates untill half way through the meal could nt get a refill on any of our drinks i had my empty soda glass sitting at the head of the table and she walks by need anything else  and the glass is sitting right in front of her uh yeah she added someone elses tab onto our bill without saying anything or asking then took her a lifetime to put it on a seperate bill all in all everything was just insanely horrible worse than denny s and sorry guys but that means a lot let it be known we re in an economic depression right now and the first businesses to feel that depression is restaurants and as a server you gotta milk every table that you re lucky enough to get as much as you can because those restaurant doors could be closed the next day for good
why does this place get business  there are only guy bartenders and they are all dooshbags the drinks are weak and extremely overpriced you have to walk through the minorities dancing to get to the bar and when you get there you are constantly bumped into by dabs the dj is ok but robbies and canteen have better ones this bar was cool back in the day but now it sucks and i do nt miss all the annoyances i experience when im there
poor service mediocre food and quite frankly southwest airlines makes a better margarita avoid mucho gusto
oh boy i was so so excited to try this place i guess i should know better than to have my hopes up eh but you live an learn right so i will spare you the gore like details and sum it all up for you with a line from billy madison do nt go stay as long as you can bad food bad service and i m outie
holy salty soup i literally just went there over my lunch break and i ca nt even eat the chicken noodle soup because its so salty it almost burns i am highly disappointed that a deli can not do yummy chicken noodle soup properly its like i poured salt packets into my mouth i got the  sandwich and soup combo and for you would think the sandwich lrb the symphony rrb would be a lot bigger than what i got it s basically the size of a half of a ham and cheese i make at home although the sandwich was kinda tasty for a half it s still tiny and not worth it for and a cup of a salt i do nt think i ll go back i am disappointed there just is nt a good sandwich shop around here i guess boo
most terrible dining experience of my existence first of all it was a total sensory overload they had a moving playing music blaring and then the sound of traffic lrb which is admittedly unavoidable rrb now to the heart of the matter the food the ribs were at least  fat the curly fries were bland greasy soggy and unpalatable and the portions if you want a ridiculously large amount of food this is the place for you but i thought it was disgusting and so unhealthy not that i was expecting much nutritional value i will never go there again and i strongly advise that you just avoid it
very disappointing i will not be back nor will i recommend this restaurant to anyone everything here  looks  really good but did nt live up to it s presentation ordered the spring rolls to start pink lady drink lrb mixture of pomegranate juice and soy milk rrb and the chow mein sadly nothing tasted good my friends i went with were also disappointed with their food none of us finished our dishes oh well too bad go to true foods in the biltmore area instead it s worth it
no ice out of menu items dirty looks abound i wo nt be coming back
brunch was one of the worst experienced overpriced lrb per person rrb and just off a mimosa served in a tumbler filled with ice  lame mimosas come in a flute period euro  styled pancake was thin chewy and better off as a frisbee mexican scramble on tortillas was disappointing i was hoping for something resembling huevos rancheros but was left with dry scrambled eggs on dry tortillas the cheese was mildly flavored and the salsa did have a kick but not enough to make the dish never again this place while trying to be different failed top it off the waitress was annoying and ditzy meanwhile scramble next door had a long line almost out the door
first off what s with the uniforms  the waiters are dressed professionally but the bar staff are in green and pink  made in mexico shirts  what s with the split  it s tacky and unprofessional i guess that fits with the glitter and pastels though as far as the pricing goes jose must want his place to be some sort of fine lrb though i doubt it rrb  semi fine dining establishment but the food and atmosphere really do nt back it up for what it is the food s half decent at best compared to many other restaurants i ve been to i d give it about a  comparing it to restaurants with the same price point i d score it even lower way too many managers and hostesses prancing around or leaning on their stations it s hardly a wonder it took so long to get our food jefe margarita was ok way over priced given how much i got lrb two sips anyone  rrb and the pitcher was terribly overpriced i wo nt make a point to go back
worst car wash i ve ever had my car was a mess  had nt been washed in a couple of months i figured eh i ll never get around to doing it myself might as well take it in somewhere this place was the closest to my house so i pulled up and asked them to give me the works it started off bad when i watched the employee get into my car after it exited the main wash building and damn near catapult herself onto greenway um you work at a car wash you d think it might be a good idea to teach yourself how to drive a manual transmission  it got worse when the car wash was over the employee lrb different one rrb very hurriedly gave me my keys and then scurried away as i got in my car and drove away i started to notice minor details that had been completely glossed over pine needles still sticking out from under my hood crumbs and dust in the recesses of the buttons on my console oily fingerprints on the passenger window streaky water spots on the driver window but that only frustrated me a little what  really  frustrated me was when i inspected my rear seats you see i drive an suv and i actually use it like an suv  in this instance i had the rear seats folded down because i had been hauling a ton of music gear the incompetent people had nt even bothered lifting up the seats to vacuum them i folded the seats up and saw the same old crumbs dust and dog hair that had been sitting there before i took it in as if this story was nt bad enough i got home and found they had left a wet rag in the driver s side footwell a wet rag are you kidding me 
came here on christmas eve eve with my family who lives in phoenix and we live in tucson the murals were cool in the back of the place inside the place is cramped and the chairs uncomfortable the artwork was fun to look at on the walls we open the menus and the prices were outrageous for this place my wife and i decided to split the chicken mole entree chicken was drowned in mole sauce that was not good at all we both agreed the best part was the guacamole but how hard is it to add pomegranate seeds to sliced avocado the service felt rushed and times i had to tell the busboy i was not finished with my meal yet the best part of the meal was the dessert people with sangrias and the total bill was with tip i recommend not to go to this place
food was nt good and had no flyovers because the chief had to cook it fast since we waited for over an hour for him to show up we come here all the time and usually the food is good it looks like they were shorts on staff f every time we asked we were told he is in the back preparing it in the back everyone on the table was hungry and was complaining
first off when you walk in it is too bright for a good bar atmosphere the peanut shells on the floor everywhere remind me of a chain wanna be divey restaurant then waitress we had was pretty clueless but tried to be nice i guess all in all it was a wasted trip to what we thought was going to be a good hang out place
formerly la cabana solaris at the biltmore has horrible customer service  not only is the staff rude but they also have no work ethic whatsoever they rarely answer the phone do nt return voice mails lock the office door prior to closing and just a horrible management team altogether i was shown the model apartment told i can not see my unit or one similar but was promised all the units looked identical to the model false after being rushed through my lease signing lrb was told where to sign nothing explained rrb given a key  rushed out the door  i walked into something similar to motel probably worse dingy disgusting and opposite of what i was told and saw lrb model rrb when i asked for my back i spoke with alicia who said i would only get my rent back not my deposit  after i expressed i was nt happy with not receiving my security deposit she was unprofessional and even threatened to refund anything if i involved the bbb or lawyers awful experience still dont have an apartment lost money when i canceled movers last minute fail
dear karim i was sooo excited to find your place my bff s favorite dessert is cobbler and she loves the whole soul food vibe so for her christmas present it was decided i would treat her to lunch at your restaurant we planned this before christmas and your website stated that you were open ampm and that worked perfectly for us so on sunday jan rd we arrived at your place at pm appetite in tow craving what you had to offer and you know what  you were closed  no freakin explanation nothing your sign even had the audacity to say open am   really  wtf kind of crap is that  if you re going to be so casual about your signage why do nt you update your website to mirror your lax hours of operation you completely ruined the day and her christmas present which we were both looking forward to we ended up going to hard rock satisfied yet still disappointed by the day s events
the staff was nice and accomodating but i really wish that i was informed at booking that they were going to have a fashion show and a live lrb extremely loud rrb band poolside all evening lrb although the band was good rrb unfortunately the whole reason i booked this hotel was so my husband could relax in the poolspa and that was impossible we could nt even relax in our room with all the noise our bedroom window faced the elevator and there was nt proper window shading available for me to get dressed without an audience i had to get ready in the cramped bathroom in order to have any privacy and that was uncomfortable for the price i was really not impressed i ve stayed in much nicer true resorts for less money and had more comfort in cheap hotels that i did here had we been able to access the poolspa during our stay i would probably have a different opinion of my experience as it is a beautiful feature of the hotel but that feature was taken away from us and i feel ripped off after this weekend i wo nt be going back
i took my car in many times to have it washed and it was nt bad at all but then i took my brand new car in they broke off one of the knobs and tried to lie about it i saw the guy do it it took them months to get the part in after weeks of calling and harassing them then to find out they installed a part that was nt correct so i had a knob but it did nt work my boyfriend took the parts of the broken knob and the new knob with the wrong connections and made it work months later i strongly suggest not taking your car in to this location if you do watch them
wow this place was so terrible we had a restaurantcom gift certificate that we bought for and we still did nt think it was worth it service is super slow the atmosphere is terrible lrb its in the lobby of a sheraton by the airport rrb and the food is the worst of all we started off with the nachos and they were decent the service was brutally slow even though barely anyone was there we had to repeatedly ask for refills on our soda and our dinner took forever to arrive we ordered a bean and cheese burrito for our daughter lrb not on the kids menu  rrb and it came full of tons of non kid friendly things like peppers and onions my wife ordered the taco salad and it came with guac and sour cream on it lrb which the menu did nt say rrb and it did nt come with a black bean salsa that the menu did say it came with i ordered a fish dish served over gnocchi which was really bland the only good entree at the table was the chorizo chicken anyway just do nt go here
it s getting worse not better here all i can say is i m very thankful that i am moving in two weeks so this was likely my last trip to this frys basically everything my first review is still true about the checkout and lack of bag help today a superrude cashier was the only one open she was obviously in a pissy mood that there is no bag help there lrb as am i rrb so rather than stopping her little conveyor belt she rams my groceries right down the line not caring one bit that there is no one at the other end to keep it all from plowing together i scramble a few things into bags myself while also keeping an eye on my two kids when i noticed she rammed two loaves of bread down the side and crushed them up against the metal change maker thingy i told her that will not work for me and to send someone to get me two new ones she huffs and puffs and actually tries to  fluff up the bread and tell me it is ok as it is omg weeks til moving weeks til moving weeks til moving
i do nt care what anyone says one friggin successful season does not undo two decades of the most craptasticly awful football yeah yeah yeah  i m glad they re actually going to go but i m not that thrilled you see their recent confrence win means i lost a year old bet booo but oh well i guess it was a lil stupid of me to think that they d never make it to the superbowl in my lifetime so they re going to the big bowl whoo hoo i guess but dude seriously where the hell was this last year  yeah last year when the superbowl was in arizona duh how awesome would that have been  az goes to the superbowl in az talk about economical boost but alas the big game is all the way in tampa bay i unno if many of the cardinal fans will be making it but for a once in a lifetime event like this you never know even though i hate football and i am comfortable with hating the cardinals and decades long suckfest it s nice to see the ultimate underdogs finally have their day sure they suck sure they ve been the worst team in history but like so many things in america we are about to experience a change now if i can only allude my old high school bookie for a few weeks until i have enough to make good on my bet
how smart does one need to be to look at an order and make sure everything is in the bag  this is the sixth or seventh time i went to this jitb just to get home and find half of my order missing they were not even busy i was the only one at the window until i was leaving being trained to observe i thought the female window help was looking at me sideways i asked myself why  well i ll tell you she knew i was nt going to get my flippin tacos one of the last things she asked me is if i wanted taco sauce  that tells me she was expecting them as well and i did pay for them but when she learned the brain dead cook did nt even get them in the fryers she made the call to just send me on my way without them with minutes of training i could have an year old getting everything in the bag so a couple of i m sorries and would you like to come back and get them her job was over like i m going to  go out of my way and drive almost miles up and miles back to get what i should have gotten in the first place  i drive a silverado x with the big ltr motor it would cost me more in fuel than the tacos not to mention letting my flippin burger get cold while i do this how about this instead of i m sorry wold you like to come back  say what is your address i ll have the stupid ass idiot that sent you on your way without your food bring the rest of your order that you paid for right a way then we ll see how many time this happens and what kind of repercussion this would bring you see it s no sweat off their a if you get your food or not and no manager will ever know so this happens all the time at the customers expense
so bad it made me angry unless you want to pay for a tasteless dry burger and cold greasy fries keep away and do nt let the people eating outside or waiting in line at the register fool you i took bites and took the burger home for my dog let s see if he ll eat it
i went there again had the margarita pizza it was soggy and tasted like a wet foot the sauce was nt good and the grated parmesan tasted like cheap kraft in the green can they say the house make the mozzarella that confuses me because it is super oily  if you use quality mozzarella its not like that you use whole milk so this is one of the worst pizzas ever i m sticking to grimaldis better pizza better salad
the only thing worth the money here is the thai iced tea i have never spent and walked away starving needless to say my husband and i will not be going back
it s a shame that the same staff attitude that one experiences at windsor has bled through the kitchen and into the ice cream shop this shop could have made a tidy little bundle off of a single retail order for ice cream for people i stopped by to set an appointment to talk with someone about a very large order for a party i was having several days later the young girl behind the counter was completely baffled nonetheless she spoke with someone who said they would be with me in a minute great i could actually try some of the flavors i was considering for my party a scoop of vanilla and a scoop of blackberry to start i took my ic outside to enjoy after a couple of bites i came across the dreaded hair gag i ve been in the hospitality industry for over thirty years and my hardend heart let this one go as i was about to have another bite i saw another hair no wait two no three hairs trapped between the vanilla and blackberry ok this is too much i returned to the counter and gave my ic back to the girl you guessed it baffled again she was then she asked if she could get me another serving of the same ic i politely refused and she never offered to refund my money for the hairy ic experience this was minutes into my visit to churn and still no managerice cream makerwhatever came out to meet with me she asked for my contact information and said that the mysterious someone would call me the party has come and gone and no phone call from anyone at churn they missed a great publicity opportunity and some serious cash from this order perhaps it s best do nt think i would want my friends eating a product where shaving cream is more appropriate than whipped cream
gay gay gay oh and did i mention gay  i really wish stars was offered this place is terrible pretentious people over priced drinks and a terrible vibe if you do nt have money you wont get anywhere in this place it s not fun and i will never go back the only thing that saves this place is the fact they serve booze i would never go to this place on my own but i have been twice because of birthday parties and i had to get wasted just to deal with the crowd i do nt want to write anymore because it s really pissing me off
 strikes and you are out i ve now given this place tries not going back again the service was not good and the food was only mediocre at best
went the first time unbelievable eyebrow waxing and pedicure been busy with work and school and really did nt have the time to take care of me had a free day yesterday and decided it d be time to relax and visit again waited outside minute because the sign out front was chipped and appear to say am  but in reality must be once rolled around a few older ladies showed up and ran with their walkers to the front door after waiting minutes i was rudely cut in line by older ladies lrb and i do have respect for my elders rrb but can not even begin to express my disgust for the staff who immediately sat them down in pedicure chairs and tended to them while blatantly ignoring me my money is just as green as granny s and i tip all of my hair dressers manicurists waiters etc    nail you saved me a dime and helped me find an even better salon
place is nt and wo nt ever have the same taste since they switched owners
ever go to a place but just before you pull in you have this gut feeling that you should just keep driving  yep that s this place however i had mixed signals because i had been there before just once but it was nt until i actually parked that i realized it however i still did nt know why though i order a chicken burrito and then when i got it bam the light went on the size of the meal the bang for the buck that s why i had the gut feeling needless to say i felt like that kid in the movie the christmas story who day after day ran to mailbox to check for his package finally upon getting it he fills out the mysterious code which turns out to be nothing more than some stupid statement telling him to drink more ovaltine  well that s how i felt upon walking away with that measly burrito for bucks  like a sucker after sitting down in my car i said to myself hell no i m not going to get jacked for bucks for a pos burrito so i went back in and got my money back people are insane charging what they do for such skimpy portions well to the recent poster there might be a reason why it s never crowded when you go in there  grimace proportions
no draft beer i had a mixed drink my wife had a guinness the can o guinness arrives the waitress pops the top beer streams out of the can onto the bartop and she hands her a mediumsized glass and walks off total indifference towards the customer wow that s some impeccable service right there the bartender that served us was absolutely indifferent we probably could have walked in wearing monkey suits and she would nt have batted an eye it s got a great location but it just feels like a rundown frat house if they got their service together it might be better but this was certainly my first and last visit there there s nothing genius about this place at all just another below average you re lucky we let you in bad service scottsdale bar edit the most hilarious part was that the male bartender knocked a cocktail shaker onto the dirty floor below and it sat there for about minutes he came back picked it up and put it next to the sink i told my wife i bet he s going to use that shaker no that s where all of the dirty cups and glasses go low and behold he picks up the mixer and mixes a few drinks in it without washing it eww come on now man you ca nt do stuff like that if they re picking up cocktail shakers off the dirty floor and then mixing drinks with it after it had rolled around for minutes in the muck what in the world is going on in the kitchen  i m not about to find out
went to this place more then x s never had a good experience here but this time takes the cake after having dinner a medium experience nothing great my friend gave the waitress his credit card to pay the bill min later the waitress came back and said are you paying cash for the meal my friend said i gave you my credit card she said well i do nt have it this went on and on for quite some time with the waitress and some man who may of been the manager they kept telling my friend that he did not give the card to them he ended up just paying cash and had to cancel his credit card well hours later guess what  they called to say they did find his card and he could come back and get it what did they do to remedy their mistake  gave him a card for drinks next time believe me there is no next time customer service does not exist here when you loose someones card and then try to blame them and find that you had it all along comp the meal at the very least
my car had been totaled i had my settlement and was ready to buy a car they had a car i was very interested in and i drove out there on a friday night the receptionist waved her hand and said that the car i was looking for was somewhere outside and she would help me but needed to find someone to cover the reception area i wandered the lot for about minutes and finally found the car i was looking for looked it over and still no one to assist me waiting waiting went back inside and the receptionist was chowing down food and told me that she still had to wait before she could help me wow how do they sell cars  needless to say i went elsewhere and found a great car
yowza where to begin first of all we ve driven past this place hundreds of times and now we know why only reason we went in is because we had a coupon lrb they seem to hate coupons as employees rrb the service was horrendous totally rude and rather expensive for a bagel joint it seems as though the only qualification to work here is the ability to come in at am egg and sausage are premade and are nuked for breakfast bagels as we were sitting in the restaurant lrb which was dirty rrb we noticed that the drivethru wait was at least minutes per person definitely not worth the wait needless to say we wo nt be going back
i wanted to give this mcdonalds no stars but i did nt know if i could anyway if you want your order wrong this is the place to be i have gone here on many occasions and out of orders have been wrong be careful when ordering a sausage mcmuffin you will get egg put on it there i even took my order back and they gave me the same thing again with egg when i specifically said sausage mcmuffin i love all people and i am not racist but if you gonna work in america you gotta not only speak english but understand it too
on a recent trip to phoenix my husband and i decided to stop by durant s to try out their steak from what i heard and read we had to try durant s at least once during our trip overall we were pretty disappointed the only saving grace for this place is the decor which makes you feel like you walked into an old style restaurant in hollywood the place was packed and crowded which is nice to see but the food was average at best my husband ordered the cajun steak which was their special for the night but it was extremely salty i had to dunk the meat in water to wash off the excess salt in order to swallow down the steak the prime rib i ordered was over cooked the garlic bread that everyone is referring to is terrible it s just french bread dunked in a bowl of olive oil with some garlic shavings on top nothing special there the sauteed mushrooms we ordered as a side was also extremely salty do they even taste their food before serving it to people  if you re visiting phoenix skip this place because it s definitely not worth it we wasted a meal by coming here
no thanks i ve ended up at charlies way too many times because the boys always wanna go but in my visits to charlies i can not think of even one time where i actually had fun never stupid music and just all wrong no thanks charlie
ew all i can say is ew i want to preface this review with the concession that i have only been here three times i am going to harshly criticize the barrista i had on my last two visits and i recognize that others may be better but she deserves to be mentioned and i think that i am not the only one that had this problem ok so i went in on labor day i get it she wanted to be at home with her bestie drinking a margarita by the pool i would have preferred that myself but i had a huge test on tuesday morning and i was using my day off to study i order a coffee i ask for a large americano she puts a large paper cup in front of me and i ask her if i could have it in a ceramic cup i m staying and i do nt want to use the resources she tells me that she does nt have any clean cups i am the only one in line so i tell her that i do nt mind waiting i will sit down and get situated and she can wash one she points to the room behind me and tells me that it s labor day she is alone in here and it s packed ok lady i get it full house but everyone is drinking their coffee there is no crazy line at the counter there is no line at all at the counter i can only assume that if you are out of cups the very first thing you are going to do when i walk away is wash some i am letting you know that i am willing to wait but i do nt say this i say there are ceramic cups right behind you those are mediums she says you ordered a large she is really really not getting the big picture i just want a damn coffee in a freaking ceramic cup so i can feel civilized while not making a bigger carbon footprint in the process and study for my anatomy exam that s fine i say i will have it in a medium cup she gives me a quarter back which is apparently the difference between ad large and a medium turns out choosing the medium cup was a mistake apparently lola bought her coffee cups based on style not function they are ridiculously wide and shallow so it s kind of like moving a huge saucer to your lips trying to slosh some coffee into your face i used about five napkins trying to wipe up the coffee that spilled all over the table lrb so much for not wasting paper rrb when i tried to set it down it tasted terrible probably due to the horrible taste in my mouth left over from dealing with the barristafromhell so after finally settling in i realize that this is the worst place in the world to study or to sit or to read or to talk to someone too tall no sound absorbers i can hear every single thing being said around me i do nt know how to descibe it other than bad energy in there kind of uptight like everyone else felt as uncomfortable as i did i actually got up and left a full cup of coffee lrb minus what spilled rrb the whole thing was just so bad i wanted to get the hell out of there even though it is right down the street from me and it looks beautiful i will never ever go back in
does anyone have an update on what is happening here  i call and call and no one answers i ordered a pizza a couple weeks ago that obviously was nt the same recipe they had previously used in the mean time i ve switched to the rosati s on val vista lrb i ve been informed it s the same owner rrb
this was quick and convenient and it was quick and convenient i ordered their fish taco plate and ended up biting into what tasted like a salt taco yuck i thought it was just one spot on the fish but my second taco was just as salty my friend had a chicken quesadilla that was equally unpleasant unfortunately the serve yourself chips and salsa could not make up for our disappointing entrees lrb
i took both of my dogs lrb koah and baya rrb here to get their rabies shot and everyone seemed nice and helpful i figured this would be our normal vet from here on out trusting them with the care of my babies baya who is a month old puppy had a seizure at the time i did nt know it was a seizure because she was nt having the grand mal type i called this vet to make an appointment and they were very helpful with getting me in that same day when i took her in i explained everything that was happening she was clapping her jaw foamslobber was coming out from her mouth she had runny poops her pawsnose were peeling and her eyes were goopy we saw dr jennings and he first thought was that she had gotten bite by something or it was rabies he was not clear at all as to what else he thought it was he asked us to complete a parvo test to make sure it was nt that so of course we did and the test came back negative he talked with us letting us know that puppies are more prone to get respiratory infections and that he would put baya on antivomiting medicine and an antibiotic even thought she was not vomiting since i m not a vet i thought this was fine and we would try out the medication and see how this worked out for our pup this was not a quick process he was very vague and not of any assistant as to what was wrong with baya he just kept telling us that her eyes the poops and the foaming was not normal well duh it s not normal we were there for over an hour figuring out nothing pretty much once we got home baya seemed okay she was nt her perky normal self but i figured she was just sick and things would get better the next couple days well i was completely wrong baya started having her clamping of the mouth seizures and they lasted for about seconds as the night went on she continued to have them by pm she had about of them i was so worried and in tears she continued to have them through the night and early morning and they progressively had gotten worse by am i was completely fed up with waiting it out and seeing if the medication would help and took her into the emergency vet lrb first regional animal hospital rrb we walked in and not even minute had past and the vet tech looked at her and said oh my gosh she has distemper i was clueless as to what that was she told me she has all of the symptoms  goopy eyes rough nose and paws runny poop and seizures i was shocked that the vet at banfield dr jennings did not pick up on this yesterday it was an extremely sad visit because we learned there was really nothing left to do for our baya and we chose to put her to sleep so she would nt have to suffer i was beyond upset at dr jennings for not seeing these signs when we took her to the vet just hours before baya would not have had to suffer and went through what she did we learned at the first regional hospital once they start having seizures as she did yesterday when we took her to the vet at just hours prior to this it s too far and there s not much else we can do we could of put her down at that visit with dr jennings and she would not have had to suffer those hours my recommendation is not to go to this vet it was a terrible experience that poor baya did not have to go through
boo if i had the opportunity to give this place a huge zero i would this place is not only disgusting it hires the stupidest people to work their front register i figured stars from yelp this place cant be bad as shane does not eat beans he simply ordered a steak burrito with no beans he even asked the chick at the front counter if it had beans inside and she said no why did we end up with a soggy chimichanga and a bean burrito when we got all the way home  their salsa taste processed like pace or cheap the soggy chimichanga was wet and not flavor full the man was not able to eat anything as his whole order was messed up resulting in all beans i was able to salvage the chicken from the soggy chimichanga and fed it too the dogs at least they did not go hungry
i have been a frequent goer to this restaurant while living in the city and while the food and drinks are great the service is absolutely terrible i have never met such an overly arrogant and prideful staff they feel that as long as you have a minor issue it is your fault and not theirs for example my friend specifically asked for the midnight martinis it is pm she serves us full sized martinis my friend was a little concerned that the waitress did nt hear us correctly and to make sure we were not being charged full priced she flagged the waitress over to which she says those are full priced martinis my friend proceeds to state that we have specifically requested midnight martinis to which the waitress responds i did nt hear you so instead of apologizing for the misunderstanding and offering the midnight specials she retaliates and gets defensive because of her incompetence we request to speak to the manager to which he towers over the table and asks what s going on here  oh hi nice to see you too he did nt even introduce himself properly nor professionally i was so turned off by the negative and defensive attitude that i have just about had it with that place it is not the first time i have received this poor service and they need to get off their high horse and get their game together sorry i m not sorry hanny s but we re going to have to part ways what is a huge turn off of all is knowing that after scrolling through these reviews out customers are very unhappy with the service provided and almost all have the same context servers and waitstaff are rude i am pleading out to the owner of hanny s for the sake of you re great restaurant please hire new management and waitstaff they are making you look horrible
look bad experiences happen to everybody sooner or later sometimes customers are rude and wo nt acknowledge it other times employees have a bad day and do nt handle situations appropriately but i have to say after having flown united on the last four trips i took  three of them multileg international trips and one of them a direct flight coasttocoast  i gotta say that united is just an awful airline planes  decrepit and wornout old every last one of them that i was on was from the s inflight entertainment which was primitive  playing a single movie for everyone from a hi videotape that s just sad fortunately it s the st century lrb everywhere but on united flights rrb so i can bring an ipod and watch a movie with my earbuds lrb but i ca nt plug it in to keep it charged because this is united  christ the ac outlets in the lavatories do nt even work psych rrb flight attendants  clearly hate their jobs and the customers all of them well except of course if they think you are a rich sugardaddy who can rescue them from their shitty jobs i am painfully polite at all times to people who have to deal with the general public i know it can be hard and you often ca nt tell people what they really deserve to hear it must be said that united flight crew are equal opportunity they are rude to everyone whether passengers are polite and as undemanding as possible or whether they act like rude clueless jerks i saw one flight attendant pick up a newspaper someone had put under his seat lrb in flight it had slid into the aisle rrb and throw it into the lap of the passenger as if he had purposely put it there to annoy her and ruin her day on several occasions i ve tried to make a little small talk with a united attendant  not to hit on them or flirt with them just friendly banter each and every time i got treated like i d offered them a handful of shit the attitude was very clear  do nt fucking bother me  i hate you i hate my job i hate every fucking person on this plane well guess what you dumb twat i m sorry they ve slashed your pay and increased your workload but i do nt like flying your piece of shit airline either none of us want to be here but i m trying to make the best of it is it too much to ask you to do the same  i mean if you are going to treat me like this i might as well treat you like shit too maybe i ll go back to my seat and needlessly ring you over at least that way i will have earned your hateful imperious attitude seating  uncomfortable barely enough room for my legs and while i am slightly on the tall side i am thin not fat should not have had an issue with this during a couple of these international flights i had legs which were not united big difference modern clean airplanes with modern inflight entertainment systems friendly flight attendants adequate leg room the only good things i can say about united is that they did get me to my destination safely and my bags did show up undamaged i guess i should count my blessings nevertheless i m avoiding united whenever possible
so i thought reading their menu seeing it in chinese language and in the chinese district it could be a real find  i love dives with surprisingly good food i was soooooo disappointed the egg drop soup was vegetable soup and just warm a minute after my soup was served my main course came out it had two items  pea pods and pork not very bbq flavor rather a funny flavor no other veges such as water chestnuts or bamboo shoots the minimal sauce was very bland the rice was not fresh
if you email the paper studio do nt expect a reply a few unanswered email inquiries about their online products will go unanswered how s that for service  a few years back i remember shopping at their booth when they were a vendor at a local mixed media art show with a great selection of unique papers and products a bit standoffish too  not very friendly either real nice impression why bother with friendly service if you are a merchant selling things  customers will be happier spending their hardearned bucks someplace else very disappointing
no just no i should have just turned around when i arrived and there was already a police cruiser parked outside at pm one side is countrykaraoke the other is a hiphop room and it all sucks i would have given it two stars for the sheer entertainment factor but the bathroom was covered in vomit plus i m pretty sure some chick was snorting something in the stall next to me
wendy s new breakfast blows i ve never been a huge fan of wendy s food however seeing their big window sign of their new breakfast sandwiches drew me in my god they looked good and my god was i disappointed i had a sausage biscuit with a kick ass looking buttermilk bun that was infused with syrup the meat was spicy lrb ala mcdonnalds rrb but the rest was just yucky i highly recommend you skip wendy s for breakfast bummer
well lets see our service was pretty good we were seated quickly and our order was taken almost immediately afterwards my fiance and i ordered the same exact thing medium well burger with garlic jalapeno and thousand island dressing anyways when we got our burgers they ended up being rare the stuff was just falling apart and to be quite honest it was disgusting however the onion rings were damn good and so was my glass of water so having a crappy burger always sucks but to top things off an annoying customer comes in and decides to sit right buy us this dude would not shut up he had an aquarium tied around his neck and kept trying to push us to buy the contents inside this dude was trying to sell baby turtles apparently he had a bunch of turtles in his backpack as well not only was he bothering us but he kept trying to get a trade turtle for a burger in my opinion when an employee of a restaurant sees this maybe they should say something it was obvious to the employees that this guy was bothering their customers anytime somebody would walk in the door he would approach them and try to get them to buy a turtle oh god sorry about that i forgot i was here to review the food my bad anyways the food sucked really bad except for those rings and the tap water i do nt think i can ever eat there again
the  bowl of soup is literally smaller than the cup of soup shame still no wifi 
they do not take phone orders for take out fail i ca nt think of any other pizza place that does nt do take out
worst breakfast burrito for too much money for  basically scrambled eggs and a flour tortilla i told them not to add ham because i read on their web site before i drove over that there was bacon no bacon and could not taste the cheese i asked for light egg and potato and was talked out of it we only put in eggs well it was one too many the salsa was the horrible nyc type we are too close to the border for that it was nice and hot though
zoe s is probably not a place to go if you are a vegan actually it s probably not a place to go if you are a trex either when it comes down to it this chain is no better than chikfila in what it offers at least with chikfila i get my food quickly and a nice side of crosscut fries zoe s kitchen sits across the street from my florist which when you really think about it was a dumb move on corporate s part both look to provide healthy food options in a market of fast food and grease the problem is that despite my florist s problems it is local more diverse and does nt make you feel like you are eating in an ikea showroom the food is just bad my chicken sandwich was dry drier than the mohave dry i m trying not to dive into other forms of hyperbole but this chicken was born and raised inside a popiel food dehydrator the least they could do would be to provide me with some mayo to fix things up a bit there s another one of these over on camelback it may or may not be better but as far as our downtown one goes this place will never see me or my money again
erich kritemeyer is the worse customer service person in the business he was horrible tripped over his own verb age did not know the contract could not explain why he did not have an answer but he sure wanted to sell me a phone that was the answer just buy a new phone we will give you a deal i already had an iphone and i was unable to get the device turned on and it is because of some red tape no one had any paper work on that would produce a decision every one said it was illegal to have possession of the phone but when i produced a police report i bought the phone they shut up i also went to a different store where they printed off a duplicate recite and they were not happy because for every answer they had i had a point they were wrong i also had them lookk in the records and see i purchased the iphone he then began quoting me the law i said thats not whats in the report unless you have law enforcement degree you should not quote the law i reminded him he could not even quote the liability clause he was so sure to stand by but could not prove he was right i asked if while i was in the store could i call the customer service line they said yeah he cut me off from the call i have no idea why the manager had to come over an reconnect the call i told erich i felt like i was in a circle jerk and he said first of all that language is not allowed i said what language he said i do not like your language i am offended i looked right at him and said is it erich lrb wanting to make sure i pronounced his name correct rrb what are your referring to when you say language because i call customer service they tell me to come here i come here you tell me to call customer service to me that is a circle jerk he said i was offending him i said this whole situation is offensive to me your lack of customer service is offensive i paid good money for a phone i can not turn on because of a legality which is really just an ethical decision that no one wants to make because there is no clarification on the liability clause you have just surfaced i realize that is a new thing for this company but it is well defined your employees both front and back office as they were termed to me would not and could not produce any paper work substantiating the fact i could not get a new number linked to my device but they were all too happy to allow me to purchase a new phone is this how verizon does business this seems like a close fine line to extortion to me are managers or store owners like erich the new faces of sell sell sell why was someone allowed to procure a line from my plan when they were not financially sound to do so is nt that how the housing market got in this fix now that the person ha had a change in heart and will no longer make payments on his line and has nt for some time i am locked out of a device i offered to take back over the line and resume liability of the line in question i just wanted to use my phone i was told over the phone by customer service on more than one occasion that it is a simple switch of the number he continues to pay on the number and a new number is put on my device this old number is put on blank device or in mr motts case the number is not being paid on and you guys can deal with that he was a former verizon wireless service manager and manipulated the system i realize he is not employed there any more and i realize you may never employ him again but why must i suffer in the after math is that the plan sell phones to people and not allow them to use them there was no clause saying i resend my permission i did it with in the allowed days as i was quoted on the phone this should of been a easy reversal once i said that erich said it was days once i said fine the original request to resend was now days ago i have been doing this all week well with in the days allowed and not all the notes have made it in the system erich then told me days really  had a thought quick enough and i said i did it days after i sent it would he then have said days please this is just one small example of how horrible erich knew the verizon policy and how disengaging he was on the store site when he was nt trying to argue the law with me he was hiding in back would nt come out and talk with me erich had ayham the manager do most of the talking ayham wanted to help wanted to work it out and also wanted to sell a phone as a last resort at one point erich s hands were shaking should i have been worried that his lack of responsibility and convoluted explanation of policy which could not be physically produced would of turned violent or was was he just nervous because he was lying and i was on the verge of getting a clue about all the legal convolution being dispensed in my direction to try and get my to buy a new phone bottom line is an easy credit check would of shown mr mott was incapable of accepting a second line when he could not afford the first
i have been a mac customer for years i know what i use and every once in while i try something new i have been to this store in particular the most every single time that i am helped by anyone but jessica lrb which i havent seen in a lonnnngggggg time so she may not be there any more sad day rrb they are rude and stuck up for example the last time i went i went in asked for what i needed to purchase and the person helping me lrb all i got was an employye id off my reciept rrb did not even look at me when she asked if that was all i needed she kept looking around and was ubber rude as she s ringing me up a couple girls that seem like that might have more money than i do walk in well the girl wanted to jump over the counter to help them clearly mac must work off commission and my poor purchase was not enough for her to appreciate me as a customer her friendlyness was amplified with them in the end i hung out looking a few other things and those girls just walked out with our purchasing anything ha suckaaaaaaaa you got nada sadly i love the product but i am going to quickly look for replacements i use a whole lot of mac products so i end up spending usually a lot more there and i would rather spend my money where they value me as a customer as much as a beach blonde super tan girl holding keys to a mercedes so if you have to purchse mac try a different store or shop online they frequently send out free shipping emails once you subscribe for now online will be the way to go for me
i will never go back to this place terrible service here is what got me  we ordered a nd round min before happy hour was to end only to have the lazy and terrible server come over and asked if we wanted another round we politely reminded him that we ordered the round prior for the happy hour special he slowly brought us our drink and when we got our bill guess what  we were not charged the correct price he used the excuse that the computer did it and that he could nt change it we again reminded him that if he had brought us our drinks in a timely manor the computer would not have charged us more he then said he d buy us one of the glasses what a jerk please it is nt coming out of your pocket do your job correctly so here is my take this place is a copy cat of many others go to the places with great service and spend your money there do nt waist your time here with these rude people
went to matt s the other day to see what the rave is about and just as i expected nothing but self perpetuated hype with the help of the food network nothing more the service was ok the coffee nothing special and my hog and chick was very unremarkable at best it was not that the food was bad however if you ca nt be seated right away it s not worth the wait this is not a special place no gem to find her just pricey breakfast food and there are other choices that you can do better with i saw a guy paying for his breakfast using three different credit cards i mean what did he eat  and how much did it cost  anyway if you are into over hyped breakfast joints and food that is mediocre at best then you may like matt s nothing against them but you guys are not all that when it comes to what you serve and your minutes of fame has long been expired making people wait to eat here is nothing more then for show trust me this is my review and i was seated right away just imagine if i had to wait in line what the review would say save your money and look elsewhere for the start of your day i give matt s stars for boring me with their breakfast and coffee and i give them another stars for being able to convince people to pay over five dollars for a lacluster breakfast which amounts to culinary rape of one s taste buds do yourself a favor when you pass by this place and your hungry just drive past and go to any other nearby spot that wo nt molest your good senses to make it you have to rely on your food and staff not guy fieti and the food network
what is the hype people  i went here for lunch after seeing all the awesome reviews but i was disappointed first the menu is very hard to understand lrb see the pic that someone posted rrb i ordered the chicken shwarma sandwich and hummus platter there is nt much of a drink selection in the tiny fridge for soda all they had was the cans and they charged for them later while i was eating i noticed a lot of people were buying their drinks from the market then coming over to order their food lrb pain in the ass if you ask me rrb anyhow so i was only of a few people there and the food took quite a while when they finally called my order i went up and asked for the garlic sauce that i heard so much about on here and the lady said it would cost i said nevermind because i was nt going to pay that for a small container of condiment i was surprised at how small the sandwich was it was nt impressive either just a grilled flatbread with a few pieces of chicken a few tomato slices lettuce and a little sauce in my opinion this was nt worth but more worth or something because of its size and how little filling there was the hummus was good but nothing spectacular this place is also in a dodgy part of town right across from project housing literally right across the street the market was pretty cool though and i ll prob return lrb during the daylight of course rrb for some olives olive oil and pita but will skip out on dining here
this is the only entry on yelp for page family practice where curtis page is the doctor i tried several times to get an appointment with the doctor and despite being told i had an appointment with the doctor i was only able to see one of the physician assistants the staff seems incompetent based on that alone where multiple times lrb at least rrb assured me i would be seeing the actual doctor basically wasted a lot of my time then i had one blood test done that the pa had ordered back in february and i got the results back then all of a sudden within the past weeks i have been receiving  calls daily from a rd party message service that does nt identify themselves or who they are calling on behalf of the message says we have a message for you from  your doctor lrb how vague is that i have a few doctors rrb and asks for my social security number working in the financial field i come across several phishing scams looking to get personal information from people and having it be such a vague message if there is a message from my doctor s office they have my number they can call me after receiving call after call after call it will not stop i had to spend more of my time to find out what this was it took some research to find out it was page family practice with lab results that i already received in february this place just keeps getting better and better whatever happened to picking up a phone and calling a patient  we have spent our money used our insurances and spent our time to seek help from them and they ca nt even make a personal phone call  lord knows all the staff they have in their office girls sitting on their ass texting on their cell phones and eating could handle that heavy work load of making a few calls jesus this place is unorganized the staff is not properly trained and the physician assistants are unable to offer any real treatment they told me oh well for this you will need to see the doctor omg i was told i took time off of work because i  was  seeing the doctor stay away from this place there are much better doctors out there with zero hassle you ve been warned
with a fresh coat of contemporary bliss attempts to fill the pews of my former favorite fate well johnny i preferred fate to sens and i prefer most anything over my first dinner tonight at bliss with a concise menu of mostly comfort food i tried the nachos and my partner the mac  cheese our food arrived within minutes which was a plus i confess that nachos are my goto guilty fave as fried tortilla strips and cheese are a delicious combo and hard to turdup unfortunately i am hard pressed to remember worse nachos the chips were odd more like wonton triangles the white cheese on the nachos was the same cheese on my partner s mac  cheese  a bland pale cheese bchamel the mac was okay nothing that competes with mrs white or cheuvronts i finished less than half of my nachos and the waitress did nt blink an eye as she removed it after i placed my visa card next to the dish signaling my surrender
unconscionable that any establishment ca nt afford an actual outgoing message on their phone line i had to walk blocks in the broiling az sun to find out from a handwritten note taped to the door that they were running shorter hours and not serving dinner now ca nt call ahead and ask because nobody is there food might be top notch but when they re running random hours and ca nt be bothered to update their info on yelp they deserve no stars unfortunately i have to give them one star because otherwise i ca nt put this warning out there do not go without calling first and if you do nt talk to a human do nt waste another second but move on to another place that knows how to run a business
typical chinese  american we were a party of and they got two orders wrong with a thin apology or discount for screwing it up would nt go again probably wo nt be around long with service like that
went here last saturday june for the party dance of the night was the viennese waltz something i had not learned yet i liked the challenge but they expect you to know five moves in minutes some people need more time than this no separation of groups who had not done this dance before upon having to rotate partners two decided to correct my hold without asking or saying anything through the course of the night you find out that the teachers are students who go through different levels of instruction which culminate in a teaching position never again will i go here i ll stick with the awesome instructors and techniques at fred astaire in chandler
the first time i stayed here was years ago and i had a great visit so when i found myself back in phoenix i knew exactly where i would stay i am sad to say that my experience this time was horrible i got to the hotel around  pm and still had to eat and had work to do i got to my room and i started sweating it was degrees outside and even hotter in the room i called down to the front desk and got the response that there are dials on the air conditioning i can turn it up when i asked to speak to the manager he said there was nt a manager there his solution was to have me follow a bell man from room to room until i found one that would work for me i immediately hung up the phone and went to the front desk at the front desk i talked to a woman who got the manager right away i explained the situation and told him that i was going to dinner and that when i returned i expected my luggage in a room that was at a habitable temperature my room was changed and the air conditioner did work in the new room but my experience left a bad taste in my mouth i understand that the guy i talked to was very young lrb it was the same guy that checked me in rrb but there are major training issues here the second issue that i faced was that i was charged after i checked out for the mini bar i never touched the mini bar lrb i did have free waldorf astoria branded water coupons of which i did take and i did leave the coupon for rrb are you kidding me  it was a good thing i went online and checked the bill they posted which is something that i never do but this hotel was just off i got the same manager that helped me with my room issue he said he would reverse the charges no apology the third thing that happened is i accidentally left the do not disturb sign on the door so i had to call housekeeping to have my room made up i was in the room while the housekeepers were there i was working on my computer and making phone calls since and no one came on the first phone call i made to housekeeping the second call an hour and a half later after i returned from lunch is what brought someone to my room i asked for an extra bag of coffee which they gave me i also asked for extra lotion since my skin was not used to the hot dry arizona weather they went to the cart and said they did nt have anymore sorry i literary looked at them like they were at another planet they went to walk away and i said you do nt have any in the entire hotel  to which one of the ladies replied we ll have to go get it and stared at me ok was my response when she returned she handed over one little bottle of lotion to which i thanked her i was very surprised with my experience here i would have gotten better service at any of the other hilton brands this is not the way the hilton runs hotels and i sincerely hope they can turn this hotel around the waldorf astoria properties are among my favorite and to see this happen is horrible the arizona biltmore used to be such a great place the grounds are beautiful the restaurants on the property had good food and i feel in love with the salvatore ferragamo tuscan soul scent of products they use it s just a shame
terrible service it took two hours to have our food served get the bill paid and leave during the lunch hour my coworker s salad was served with no dressing at all it took the waiter minutes to bring us a balsamic replacement unacceptable the food was only soso  the southwestern spicy burger looked like a frozen patty
in a word yuk ate there several times got upset stomach each time something wrong with their food only place on mill that i do nt like their food
good sushi but i found a small cockroach in my wonton soup and what did i get for my troubles  a  coupon off the clippers magazine i paid and left the stupid coupon on the table
most the time its pretty good but this last time i had to ditch the burger as the guy at the grill was sweating profusely i could see him dripping from the drivethru f n gross
do nt get your keys made here  they never work different times this has happened not a fluke
 warning  do not use this service facility i brought my chevy truck to bud s service center with a rough running engine bud the owner told me i needed a tuneup of course i am not a mechanic i told him if that would fix the problem then proceed bud obliged i paid him for new spark plugs and a fuel injection service unfortunately bud is incompetent and gapped the spark plugs more than chevrolet recommends to add insult to injury the fuel injectors in my vehicle do not require a flush as i found out when i got a second opinion i was provided with a bulletin from gm verifying such bud insisted gm stole the technology from him and that the fuel injection service was warranted needless to say my truck was still running rough the next day i called bud and told him of the same rough runing engine and he told me to come back in and he would take care of it so for the second time i drove miles to his shop with my girlfriend following me to drop off the vehicle the next day bud called me and told me i needed a new intake manifold gasket i was skeptical but told him if it would fix the problem proceed he obliged i paid him for the repair as i drove away from his facility the engine was still running rough i called him again and he told me to come back in and he would take care of it fearing another or bill from bud i took it to a reputable repair shop precision auto in glendale az it was during the second opinion i found out about the improper spark plug gap and unnecessary fuel injection service recommendation from gm precision auto replaced one spark plug and i drove the vehicle home i called bud and told him about the improper gap and he admitted to not being aware of the proper gap from a gm bulletin as i have already lost all confidence in bud s service center i brought the vehicle to chapman chevrolet for a full evaluation the cost of the evaluation was nearly and they confirmed the spark plugs were gapped incorrectly by bud s service center they also told me the problem was the aftermarket fuel injector module previously installed i paid them another for the repair to bring the vehicle back to stock upon confronting bud the owner of the situation he became very defensive and told me to never come back to his facility of course i would not but the problem is that even with acknowledgement of an error bud was unwilling to remedy the situion at this time i am disputing the charges with my credit card company and am prepared to file a lawsuit against bud s service center in justice court do not bring your vehicle to bud s service center they are incompetent and unprofessional for proof of the above email joewoolgmailcom paperwork never lies and if you want to see proof i have it
worst service ever minutes to get my order inside with only people in front of me they pay attention to the drive through only and that too looks slow dont go here they are rude too
we checked out rnr on sunday lrb just a few days after opening rrb in all fairness i have to agree with many of the other reviews even though they are new these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein the building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny sunday morning there was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer the menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items he was struggling to explain our drinks took more than minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time our water had just disappeared then the food i ordered the grill cheese lrb a rare treat and when i order it i want it good rrb it was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread the cheese was nt melted i sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out icky our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids it became comical after the third person came out my husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings the eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless we even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and come back and try us again he made no effort to make things right either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back there are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre the young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables
i do not like this dave  buster s let me start by saying i am a ridiculous goofy immature big kid at heart i love arcades and the only thing i love more than that is winning tickets to spend in the prize store this location makes me mad though just because i act like a kid does not mean i want to be rubbing elbows with your little rugrats i know this is a kid friendly place during the day but for goodness sakes make them behave there are screaming rude children all over here i was playing one game while being poked and prodded by a year old wielding a balloon sword not cool buddy if you want to let your kids run and scream and misbehave take them to chuck e cheese or peter piper but db s is not appropriate for that i should also point out that a lot of their machines forget to pay out and a good portion of them will just rip you off in general i also hate that i have to go upstairs to go to the main event that s not cool at all i hate this db and i will not go back
i cant believe this place is still open the food was terrible they do have a great beer selection but that s about it not even close to german food who ever is pickling the food over there deserves to be shot
what a grimy little corner of mill i was with a dinner party of graduates and we were dressed formally whoever chose to come here after rula bula must not have anticipated the constant stream of questioners grunting hey why you dressed like that  wedding  the topper was being offered a shot by a group of yearold boys to help them out sorry i ll stay here with my husband and soberly contemplate the awful logo and  what s that there   a pole with exposed nails fallen off from a wooden bench if you dare come here be sure your tetanus is up to date
over priced rubbish
very disappointed ordered delivery food was cold and bland worst general tso chicken ever tasted
i used to go here when the staff were knowledgeable nice and the prices were just i usually rent lenses here and get my gear here however in the past year they have slipped into what i call walmartism where they are the only heavy weights around and must bow down came here to rent a few lenses a mm canon l lrb they only had the mark rrb and rented as if it were a brand new just lens of the mark ii when asked if they will ever upgrade their rental equipment they said no we do not give into them just upgrading the lens just so they can sell at a higher price this is false i am no expert but the quality and technology called for the upgrade and it was a completely different lens they felt the same about the mm shame shame its like comparing a point and shoot to a dslr nd complaint on the lens rental that was not upgraded i asked how much to rent for week for a tse mm on the phone they said wait a minute website says lady came and said oh sorry we need to update our website i asked for honor and she said no rd they are way over priced look and you will see that compared to other retailers that they are  marked up its like shopping at bestbuy understanding that they been around here along time and probably developed a strong fan base that they will attack me for this review but lets look at them as a business and not a personal friend they want money you got money enough said overall lost my business and recommendation for a good local camera place last place to ever shop locally and time to take my dollars online rip tempe camera until dr frankenstein revives you with adjusted prices upto date gear and competent staff
on its best day this place is mediocre the food is what you d expect from a mexican food joint nothing exciting here the thing that sets this place apart is the service i m kind of surprised its still in business i went there most recently for sunday football ticket with friends it may have been minutes between rounds despite us being just one of two tables we had to ask a number of times before anyone brought us anything terrible experience from a bunch of unmotivated college students our server had a cardinals rodgerscromartie jersey on if he waits on you be prepared to wait on him lazy as hell bottom line is there are a number of better places nearby pick one of them instead
holy crap i have never felt like a criminal like i did in kohl s for no reason i was in there buying alot of stuff for my house some gifts and a few clothes for me and my girlfriend we were in there about hrs we were buying a lot of kitchen stuff the whole time the manager was following us and standing there starring with her arms crossed it was soo weird and she looked like einhorn from ace ventura any way me and my girlfriend went to the dressing room to try stuff on and the manager followed us in there and then told us we could only bring in at a time which is nt even the policy then after her starring us down we checked out and she went to the register with the cashier and after the cashier would ring things up the manager would pick it up look in the pockets shake it lay it down and feel every where i was like what are you looking for  she ignored me and smiled i said ookkay then the total was then i chose debit and entered my pin she grabbed the card out of my hand and was like give me your id that s when i got really pissed i told her that she is nt allowed to ask for my id when i pay debit i told her i would love to give her my id because she will feel like an asshole when she sees it is me i told her to give me her corporate number and i wrote her name down she was very silent the whole time and did nt even ask why she knew she fucked up she stormed off but not before i told her not to forget she works in scottsdale and people spending this amount of money should nt be treated like criminals especially in scottsdale where it is expected the cashier told me she does that all the time i called corporate and raised hell this was really strange and extremely extremely insulting plus all the stuff in kohl s you can find at marshals cheaper and they carry alot of stuff at walmart cheaper also
let me preface this by saying the pizza and service are spectacular five stars for those why am i writing this and only giving one star  for stupidity if the manager gave us a reasonable explanation then you would nt see this my mother ordered two shots of vodka on the rocks she requested two olives in it not an unreasonable request the bartender came over to the table and said we do nt have whole olives will sliced be ok  huh  a bar without whole olives  perhaps they ran out  ok sure my mother said she would try sliced presentation of the drink sucked it came in a pint glass with the ice way above the vodka no stir stick and the olives  were in a rocks glass they were nt even queen olives they were small sliced olives like you get on a pizza but i am not writing about the presentation of the drink we got the bill for our drinks  inch pizzas a inch pizza a pazookie and here it comes olives no shit they charged us for condiments we had to ask why as we have never been charged for having a lime in a beer or cherries in my daughters shirley temples or olives anywhere in the world the bartender never mentioned and extra charge for sliced olives each now a shot for vodka not unreasonable even for rail i am not upset about the drink the slap in the face is the charge for olives that were not even whole so the manager lrb carrie  rrb comes over and gives us some bs story that other places have figured the cost of the olives into their drink prices so that is why we have never ever seen this before anywhere in the world hmmmm how do those places know how many olives we are going to ask for  or limes or oranges or cherries you know i used three squirts of soap and three squares of hand towels when i used their restroom did i go over my limit on those  think i should go back and have them add it to the bill  i am only writing this because i was not satisfied with the reason given to me by the manager my mother ordered a rail drink lrb not call rrb and had to pay for condiments stupid dear mark russell you have awesome people great food and service however you need not charge for olives in drinks kind of stupid right 
wow service has gotten worse and worse at this location last week i had one person in front of me and minutes later was still waiting for our drinks so today i order and a new girl is working the reg never in my life have i had a barrista mess up my drink and then calls me out in front of the whole line to rering me up for the cent difference and then continues tell me i ordered it that way not only did she get size wrong but i guess she didnt hear the skinny part either anyways i wonder if that little girl realizes that cent rering just cost them about  month in business usually starbucks has such good customer service ugh
arrrgghhhhhhh    i have to say in life i try not to hate things i think everyone will understand when i say i hate flying this airline mixed messages rude staff broken seats are all par for the course i will avoid saving that few bucks on price line and pay hard coin to be treated line a paying customer instead something that the overworked humanoids behind the desk have to process and deal with during our sometimes long uncomfortable time together ughh i need to take a shower after writing this i feel gross
you know when you crave for something and you expect nothing but the best and of course what do you get nothing but the worst of the worst i m telling you even my boyfriend can cook better than this place and he is nt the best cook in the world this country this city well you catch my drift worst of all they not only taste bad they re mucho expensive like the old yelp cliche if only i can rate zero star if i had to pick lo cascio vs chef boyardee chef boyardee baaaaaby
the worst service i have ever had good food can not make up for terrible service
horrible service waited over on hour for meal which was incorrectly prepared will not be returning
will not go back ever the trouble started when i booked the appt i did nt want to give my address to join the mailing list this was apparently was a huge issue it should not ever take minutes to book an eyebrow wax appt then i arrive minutes early for a and the women i had the appt with grace was nt even there yet she finally arrived minutes late and had to set up the room this leads to another minutes i had someplace else to be so finally i left totally ridiculous if i had been minutes late it would have been a big issue real sick of a total lack of customer service around town lately
i planned my daughter s th birthday here i set up the party plans with a coordinator at their hq in dallas originally planned for people and then changed the number down to after the bill arrived i spoke with the gm about the over charges lrb for ppl rrb and he was such a prick about it he would nt even look at the emails that i had between myself and the party coordinator stating that i was paying for people there was a lack of communiation between the dallas people and the dave  busters at desert ridge no one ever confirmed the  before we got going this could have been avoided i would have had the chance to leave and take my business elsewhere the gm completely ruined the day by being such a jerk about it i got a call from the assistant gm last night lrb after he read my poor survey review online rrb and he tried to make it right by offering me credit towards their establishment uhhh i do nt think so i will never be back i have never gotten such bad service from a restaurant manager before we were overcharged and i just want the overcharge fees back i will happily pay for the rest do not plan your child s birthday party here the only reason i came here is because it is the only bowling alley up towards north scottsdalecave creek where we live it is a huge rip off and i will never be back be warned
us airways track record with me is  flew flights in the last week the first plane we were brought back to the gate since there was an issue with their autopilot then the new plane they gave us sounded like it was going to fall apart i overheard the flight attendant say they re about to put that plane into retirement now ready to go home and flying back the same thing happens but now there is something wrong with the ac did nt get in until hours later get your act together peeps plus the bag check in fee blows
very small and dirty looking and nearly no parking as we were in the mood for soul food and lolo s was closed we read reviews for this place and decided to give it a shot we called ahead as we are minutes away the young lady on the phone told us that they would be open until pm great we thought we showed up around pm and there was nobody but a gentleman at the register chatting it up and belly laughing as we stood there awkwardly not being acknowledged we decided to seat ourselves we sat nearly before the gentleman motioned that the menus were up where he was still on the phone mind you we sat and looked over the menus still not having been greeted by anyone minutes or so later a young woman comes out from the back and rudely states that we must leave we asked why  her response was they were closing in a couple minutes and if we wanted to order we could only choose from their two specials we mentioned that we spoke to a young woman over the phone and she had stated that they would remain open until pm she replied no nobody said that we are certain it was her to which we spoke as we even double checked the phone number dialed against the one on their flyers that were at the register sorry ca nt review the food may have been great but their hospitality was not this horrible experience did nt ruin the night as we had great bbq at famous daves instead
us airways is probably the worst airlines i ve ever flown on but i swear they usually offer the cheapest tickets i put up with the bad customer service delayed flight times horrible inflight service and outdated planes just because of the cheap price of the airline ticket what sucks even more is i am a rewards member with them i have enough to book a oneway flight but they do not allow you to book one way flights with your mileage points you would have to be charged roundtrip what s up with that once i have enough miles to book a roundtrip flight i will do so and then hopefully never fly us airways again i say only fly us airways is if its the cheapest by far or a last resort
literally all of the food was brought out cold we had our meal comped but it was a total disaster they did nt know how to handle it it was extremely awkward lrb between the server and manager rrb etc the kitchen has a prep problem between the meat  the veggieside staging areas etc this is one poorly managed restaurant tons of staff just walking all over the place looking important but not doing anything meanwhile looking around you can see everyone at every table has that glossyeyed look just wondering when their server will be back empty glasses dirty plates long food waits etc workflow is horrible people are inefficient etc part of the problem is that there is a backup for servers to enter the orders into the computers near the kitchen we sat right next to this area and watched as servers spent waaaaay too much time tapping away on the screens this should nt be bottom line  they need new managers and need to fire and retrain a bunch of staff why they do nt have hh in the restaurant area is beyond me
i was very excited to stay at here being an architectural fan i did love the building and the grounds however the service and overall stay was horrible from start to finish this started with the bell service who forgot to bring my bags to my room after they pointed me in the wrong direction for parking the car and walking back to the lobby in plus degree heat to check in i had to walk back to the bell desk out front to ask them to bring my bags up after they never showed up in my room the room was hot and the ac turned up full blast was completely inadequate the shower somehow only got extremly hot water which is not fun when the ac does nt work later that night before going out to dinner i put a card out for breakfast in the morning when we returned from diner i noticed the card had not been picked up i went to the lobby to tell the front desk the front desk took my room number and insiste they would send someone right up to get it and not to worry because my breakfast would be there in the morning when we woke up the card was still on the door and no breakfast was delivered although the grounds and building are beatiful you do nt need to stay here to see that i was so excited to stay here and in the end i could nt wait to leave horrible
ok now that you are reading based on the one star went for a dinner for four on a saturday night and the female bartender who is always there has no personality and is about as customer service oriented as an old shoe our waiter took the males dinner order before the females served salad and had to be asked what happened to our appetizer and he clearly forgot the story goes on with forgot drink orders and the delivery of desert to those of us having the prix fix menu and the rest had to ask for a menu and again he was surprised so he said dessert is on me you guessed it desserts were charge on the bill as was a salad price doubled this was the second try with the same results in so yes it is a land mark and yes it is red walls and old school cool but food is ok and service keeps disappointing for the price i will go elsewhere
service was great the food was not old iced tea  the ranch dressing for the chicken bacon ranch quesadilla must be out at the ranch dry dry dry maybe i will try them in a year or so
the pharmacy is just terrible you are ignored and abused i just spoke to the manager she asked to phone if i had a good experience as she was going to speak to her manager i told her that in three years i have not had a good experience they are harried abrupt and semi rude no eye contact no thank you for coming you are abused and demeaned ineveryway terrible terrible terrible walgreens is much better they may be over worked but they are polite if you want to give them you business go ahead they have not earned it i will never go to that pharmacy again susan wenger
danger do not bring your kids here it all started when my child came home with what seemed to be a stomach flu i took him to the doctor only to find out by a stool sample that he had ingested a chemical found in pools that is potentially fatal if swallowed in large quantities i am warning you now that i have spoken with the owner and confirmed he had been adding chemicals right before lessons however he refused to take responsibility stay away from this place at all costs i did not get a refund nor did te owner offer to cover medical costs the most interesting thing about this issue is shortly after my son became ill i heard from someone at the front desk that said multiple instructors also were ill with identical symptoms and some even had left the school because they were worried about their health think very carefully before coming here you could save your child s life i personally switched to hubbard swim school and have seen much better results in a shorter time and of course the owner assured me nothing is added within two hours before lessons so the pool does not get shocked hope this review helped shame on the owners at gold medal for not taking safety in mind for these children first before attempting to make the pool look pretty 
this coffee is awful good thing there is no reason for me to ever go here again
probably the worst sushi in old town i ve lived across the street from pearl for years and every time i go because of convenience i regret it i ve even tried ordering takeout but they always seem to miss something in my order which means i have to wait another  minutes or come back
oh dos hippies how i wanted to love you sooo much i d been passing this place by due to the long lines around noon and just biding my time until i too would get to taste the deliciousness i should have waited longer i went in on a friday around and there was no line i was so excited i perused the simple menu and was delighted to find cactus tacos this is something i grew up eating we called it  nopales and i d never seen it on a taco menu so i ordered two cactus tacos with no cheese the very nice chick behind the counter said that the cactus was prepared fresh daily and mixed with feta cheese okay i m not lactose intolarant just watching calories so i said that would be fine just no extra cheese she suggested i get three tacos but i stuck with two glad i did i then paid for a can of diet pepsi  get fountain drinks please i waited less than minutes to pick up my tacos from the patio window in the back and sat down amongst a bunch of happily chewing people i was excited the size of the tacos was great i was really happy i only got two bc i would nt be able to fit in three i also noticed that there was shredded cheddar on them even though i d asked for no extra cheese i took off as much as i could and did nt think much about it as i picked up the first taco i thought  wow these seem cold omg these  are  cold who eats cold tacos  the nopales lrb prickly pear cactus rrb were ice cold ice cold the flour tortillas were also cold the only thing that was nt cold were the lukewarm pinto beans okay i m halfmexican and will eat a lot of things in a tortilla almost anything but i have never been served cold nopales okay i decided to give it a try because i m willing to try anything once the first bite was crunchy and my intial thought was holy crap they did nt clean the cactus of needles then i realized the crunchiness was merely from the  partiallycooked  rice that was in the taco i opened up both tacos scooped the uncooked rice out and finished them i wanted to like this place so badly why oh why could nt you have been amazing  i may be too forgiving but i m willing to go back and try one of their hot dogs but give me some time
been to this wendys a few times not the best customer service but its ok if ur really hungry i have not returned to this location since the redesign to the walmart in that complex lrb the reason is because they have a subway in walmart now rrb
you know i d hate to knock the service because the employees are genuinely nice but damn horrible car wash just went in today august th and got a hand wax and the prestige wash i specifically ask for no interior dressing and it s in there wax still left on the car in several places the bugs i asked to be removed lrb and would have even been willing to pay a couple bucks extra for some attention to detail rrb were still caked all over the front of the vehicle water spots all over granted it is degrees outside but this place will make you wish you had washed the car yourself i would definitely not recommend this establishment to anyone else i have tried it twice before this being the third time and i guess i have to learn the hard way the managerowner should be ashamed look at all the reviews for this place honestly everyone should be refunded at least half of their money for even giving this place the time of day i had nt had my car washed for about weeks and i wish i would have kept it like that as far as i can tell my car has more aesthetic damage to the paint after the wash than it did prior to the wash they do a half ass job of washing and then proceed to massage the remaining dirt into your paint job
 ya know i should have known better never settle for less cuz your in a hurry
i would like anyone who has gone to insight imaging for mammography in or and they were unable to find your films for comparison when you had your mammography done please contact me if you have been told that they lost your records or had nothing to compare them to or that they had sent previous records to your doctor but your doctor does nt have them thanks so much
dear jesse t thank you for your quick reply in response to your comment about the hotel room mixup i was aware that this was the reason the keys were nt working as i said previously my issue was the lack of concern and initiative on the part of the staff if you read closely i believe i said that having new room keys was nt a problem but the fact that no one made any effort to give us our room keys and instead we had to go to the front desk late at night after finding out ours no longer worked was an issue to me i will no longer be staying at your hotel this is simply advice so you might retain longterm customers in the future you have a nice hotel but with that comes clientele that have certain customer service expectations in order to help you to check the wifi situation i will tell you we were staying in a room on the first floor to the right of the lobby however i will not tell you what room to ensure the proper housekeeper is spoken to this is an overall problem and not the responsibility of one person trying to do their job in fact if you assign rooms to certain housekeepers this could in fact be part of the reason it is not a team effort to first clean rooms with a sign on the door no it was an overall issue with cleanliness my mother pointed out one afternoon that the cigarette butt she had seen the previous evening in the walkway to our room was still there we were all a bit disgusted when we came back hours later and it was still there even though there was a cleaning lady nearby perhaps instead of chastising individual employees for a single dirty room there should be an overall standard of cleanliness for the entire hotel by which all employees are judged lastly i understood the deal you were offering but it was a monday night and the room was free we were agitated and obviously not returning to your hotel even making a slight allowance such as how about if we still have plenty of rooms by tomorrow afternoon i ll give you the extra night would have perhaps made us reconsider our negative view on the service at your hotel instead the woman behind the desk very coldly and rudely informed us of the rules you just stated and then turned away my sister lives in scottsdale and used to recommend your hotel but after seeing the way her family was treated and knowing how many better options there are she told us she would never recommend the hotel again yes you may have lost one room for one night but you may have gained new visitors to your hotel i think a shrewd costbenefit analysis may have put up with a small loss for a big future gain again this is all just advice take it or do nt we most certainly wo nt be returning to check up on your progress
lousy customer service hector the barbackbusboy was the only one that cared about my service they didnt bring out bread with the meal the food was bland and overpriced even the hostess didnt care wow save your money go somewhere else
wow now you guys rename a new page the w scottsdale and call this one something different to hide your bad ratings shady my og review was for the scottsdale w and now it is for the living room and i see a scottsdale w related  hmm weird shady shady shady and guess what this w lrb not all rrb still sucks major donkey balls i am also going to repost this review on both pages as it is for the hotel itself lrb and yes i have stayed there rrb original review this w sucks so smug and unpleasant whether its the annoying people the overpriced everything or the horrible staff this place blows hard i have been to w s in sfhollywoodny and they all actually are pretty cool and i have enjoyed them you can totally tell that persians run this joint do nt get me wrong i love persian people but there is that certain breed of them that wear douchey designer glasses and are obsessed with shiny jewlery and their series and treat people like shit that is the vibe this place puts off like a sleezy wanna be vegas spot that is so far from cool that it is laughable do nt even waste your time but if you do make sure to pregame because that shit is expensive 
i was a regular here since they opened overall a satisfactory place but i would say in times out of the to ive been here there was something lacking i usually got shaken beef xtra sauce curry chicken and chk fried rice xtra sauce multiple times the shaken beef onions were raw and curry chk meat was dry i made a point next time to bring to their attention but never asked for anything free and always left a good tip after eating there that many times u would think they would know my order and get it right wrong the one time i actually complained about raw onions and wrong extra sauce on carry out lrb like i wouldnt notice rrb manager faith said she would give me a shaken beef on the house thank you faith for giving great customer service the next time i was in owner dennis told me manager faith would have to be there because she was paying for it thats not right she didnt take my order or undercook my food so why is she responsible  little did he know that if he offered to take care of my meal lrb rrb i was going to pay for it anyway because i appreciate great customer service but because of the way i was broomed like he didnt need my business i will not be back i have a small business in surprise and have told plenty of my customers about this place thats done i dont want anything free but i deserve an apology
cityscape continues to represent all that is wrong with phoenix artificial ignorant of its site and isolated from it s surroundings despite being promoted as the centerpiece of downtowns rerererevitalization the development has yet to deliver hopes of residential units have been delayed  if not dashed the anticipated grocery store lrb highend or otherwise rrb has yet to open highprofile local businesses have pulled out and national chains have reduced hours or laid off staff not only is cityscape blatantly anticity and antiurban  it does nt even compare well with its suburban competition from the inside there is no there there patriots square is still a concrete mess the exterior windows are still covered and the few businesses have minimal signage their glazed windows make it difficult to see what s inside lrb particularly on the upper levels rrb boosters of cityscape may like the convenience of the parking the sterility cleanliness the security lrb read homeless patrol rrb and the excitement that occurs during peak moments what they do nt comment on is the emptiness that pervades the development between these rare events they also seem to be immune to the banal architecture and it s isolation from the rest of downtown highlighted by the contemptuously blank walls facing large swathes of jefferson and washington sure cityscape may be better than  nothing but do we really want to set the bar so low  to be fair i do like a few of the tenants especially the newly opened arrogant butcher and even the franchised jimmy johns i m happy that downtown finally has a pharmacy however they are not enough indeed i wish that they were the exception that proves the rule and not the rule themselves these type of businesses should be the lures to get people excited and drawn downtown where they discover locally owner businesses and begin frequenting them instead customers of jimmy s get to see a competing chain  and arrogant butcher diners get a panoramic view of parking lots to make things worse for downtown as a whole the few business that have opened and several of the office tower tenants could have easily found space instead of using public funds lrb which now make up about half the project s funding rrb to lure business to cityscape the city could have helped these businesses settle in downtown s existing urban fabric imagine the arrogant butcher and cvs on the ground floor of the incredible luhr s complex or lucky strike reusing the under appreciated mcginnis building across from the duce on south central  the remaining stores and restraints could have easily fit in the empty store fronts of the collier center cronkite building or several other nearby buildings the office tenants could have stayed in the previous downtown locations or moved to the luhr s buildingor the former phelps dodge offices by going this route we now have more empty offices and store fronts downtown than ever before indeed cityscape is looking more and more like the collier center with lucky strike filling the role of hard rock  arrogant butcher playing kincaid s and banner health acting as bank of america phoenix needs to learn that while mixeduse is important a mixed used mega development will never be a substitute for the authentic diversity that grows out of several smallerscale densely organized projects cityscape is a paradox it was intended to be a bold new form of development downtown but ended up being a lesser facsimile of the nearby arizona and collier centers perhaps the biggest irony is that while it s name and marketing scream their urban ambitions cityscape is almost without a sense of urbanism
racist bigot owner racism or making fun against any group of people is unbelievable however mr wonderful wanda thinks it is ok look at the menu they have an item labeled redneck bendict i was there for breakfast recently because my girlfriend was hungry we noticed the offensive racist prejudicial verbiage and respectfully told the wife of the owner we found it offensive she said nothing initially later she apologized for her husband lrb the owner of wonderful wandas rrb my girl and i paid our bill provided a tip and left upon the next visit requested by my girlfriend we were abrupbly told to leave the restaurant by the owner because we were rude according to mr wonderful wanda we were dumbfounded he told me to take my yellow bitch and never come back i refrained from breaking his face and drove down the street to the good egg excellent food at the good egg by the way my girlfriend is asian lrb laotian rrb and she was very offended so if you are a proponent of bigots racists horrible service an outhouse bathroom nestled in the anals of the kitchen average food cramped surroundings and unattractive servers that never smile  please solicit wonderful wandas if not go somewhere else google redneck it is dorogatory racist and wrong please do not support such a pathetic establishment
i have eaten here before and been pleased this time however was nothing but disappointment our waitress messed up the order checked on us once and took forever getting change and to go boxes she was either fairly new or just not a good waitress the food was luke warm and best with my prime rib being tough and tasteless the side dishes looked like they had been prepared days before and left in a warming bin their consistency was that of mushy oatmeal the ribs were overcooked the shrimp was overcooked and the rest of the food was boring i am a very generous person but this night did not feel like the absolutely lousy service warranted a tip i did nt leave one while i was getting my car down the hill the waitress had the nerve to confront my family about why no tip was left very unprofessional it s gonna take more than some crappy  off coupon to get us to ever go back we never will i would avoid this place like the plague
a group of friends and i tried it out lrb was my second time eating here rrb last week and we all got sick we all had different things and the food was greasy and gross i do not recommend this place and i wo nt be back
last summer my wife and i adopted a kitten from arizona humane society everything was fine we took him for his shots and all looked good a couple months ago he started acting sick we took him to our normal vet and they put him on some antibotics a few days later he was no better i returned to my vet and they xrayed him and found his chest was filling up with fluid our vet said he had one of the incurable cat diseases and that he had it from birth we had to put him to sleep i will not get another pet from this place or support them financially because they do a poor job of testing the animals they put up for adoption it s sad enough to loose a pet but one so young and who we had taken into our hearts still hurts
somethings are just wrong imagine a college kids fridge with left over chinese and some tortillas i love chinese i love mexican cheese and general tso chicken ick
not good at all this place advertises itself as healthy mexican food and i ve been meaning to stop in for awhile they serve at a counter where you pick your entree i decided to go for the taco combo on soft corn tortillas one with shredded beef and the other steak he threw the tortillas on a grill which i presumed would make them hot but they were not scooped the beef in sauce out of a bin on one tortilla and pulled steak pieces out of another i also had a scoop of mexican rice and i chose the black beans the only thing served hot were the beans the next person behind the counter topped the meat with toppings of my choice  pico de gallo corn cilantro  and gave me a cup for my drink they have a separate area with toppings corn salsa hot sauce mild sauce jalapenos and olives the salsa tasted like tomato sauce and the hot sauce was barely hot i went to my table picked up the shredded beef taco and the tortilla broke apart in pieces they really should double the tortillas for tacos the beef was lukewarm the toppings cold and was nt very flavorful the steak on the other taco was cold dried out and very tough i could nt even pull it apart with my hands i took the steak out and just ate the tortilla with the rice beans corn and pico de gallo they were pretty busy here and maybe i ordered the wrong stuff but i do nt think i ll be back to try something else the food just was not good or fresh about for the taco combo plus a medium drink
well i was forced to return here to drop my bike off to be shipped to ironman wisconsin through tribike transport good i thought maybe they ll make it back into my good graces nope sure i dropped my bike off an hour before the deadline my fault i asked if they could do a quick look over if they have time before it s picked up and i got a straight up no we ca nt oookkaaaaay and then i got no good luck even though it was obvious i was dropping it off to go to wisconsin for an ironman geez it s kinda a big deal ya know  do nt they have a triathlon team  then when i picked it up i did nt even get a how did your race go  nothing i mean ca nt a girl brag a little  that was your last chance landis peace
terrible customer service you will wait in line for no less than hours just to be let down by the salesman saying that there is nothing that we can do the customer is certainly not  at this store they will not budge from policiy or procedure to satisfy the customer in the least bit i ve been a sprint costomer for well over years and my phone broke so i needed a new one before i left out of town for work my credit towards a new phone was coming in two weeks and they would not help me out at all or at least prorate the cost of a new phone for me they wanted me to pay full price lrb rrb for a new phone  i had to call sprint directly to get some sort of flexibility out of the horrible management team at this store do yourself a favor and flea from this place like a burning building if you can
 words do nt waste your time the menu limited food not flavorful workers ungrateful
okay so i do nt want to bring my year old into a sushi restaurant its saturday and i call for take out thinking we ve done ra and sushi so lets try bombers we brought home sashimi tataki and sushi its priced between ra and sushi but both my husband and i thought it was meh at best blech at worst maybe its a better experience if you re there and drinking but we were not impressed its not impeccable fish its just okay
i would not recommend this car wash to anyone that has either a tight budget or a good carwash in mind i d decided to give this car wash a shot after hearing good things about it and i was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons  for their most basic wash is fairly high especially considering that a number of other places do a better job for more competitive pricing  i was told that my wash would take fifteen minutes it took them an hour honestly i did nt mind the fact that it took them an hour the fact that they were dishonest about the estimated time is what bothered me  they did not wash my car roof when i took my car back to them to point this out they argued that they d tried to get the bird droppings off and failed upon hearing this i pulled over to their gas tanks and cleaned my roof myself most of it came off even without any soap so in short do nt trust these people in addition to doing terrible work they re also quite happy to lie to your face stay far far away
sorry to say i wanted to like this place great patio and curb appeal but its a jaguar body with a vw bug engine my wife and i were sat immediately as it was a tuesday night and not hopping a man showed up immediately and took our drink order and identified himself as joe the manager he quickly disappeared to never show up again he evidently did not let our waiter know nor did he care that we sat without our drinks i have to point out that our waiter was excellent but even he as tentative as he was could not save the operation from itself lrb forgot his name but he must have been great attitude rrb we sat next to the display kitchen where we watched countless dish sit at the window this place was not busy and they could not get the food out to customers in time seemed as if there were at minimum three managers on duty and they would sit by the window chat while the expiditor searched for the appropriate waiter with evident frustration my wife ordered the filet and i the steak tacos lrb note these too sat at the window less than feet from our table till i caught the expiditors eye and had him deliver these to us rrb filet was acceptable little overcooked but acceptable my steak taco s were a joke like someone else mentioned in a review they must think the customers are stupid my taco s were loaded with iceburg lettuce and maybe an ounce of steak in each might as well have been a vegitarian version gringo flavor there is no excuse for this operation to be so confused still i believe it opened in october note to tqla get it together you wont last long in gilbert you wont survive just on the bar crowd food must get better and be served hot competition is coming right down the street and this group will eat you alive from both perspectives ended with a quattro leche dessert no good either think cold wet bread might have been ok had it been warmed through
i knew i did nt want to eat there when my family said they wanted to took forever to get our meal and of us ordered medium rare when they came out the were well told the mgr and he didnt to a thing about it fries were cold
i can not for the life of me comprehend how or why this place consistently has one of the longest lines to get in damn near every weekend it s a pool hall and an average one at best where s the attraction  it s usually cramped and uncomfortable drinks were average and the music sucked
this was my wife s first visit to this facility and it is definitely going to be the last while the wait was not very long the doctor that saw her frankly in my opinion should be ashamed to have md after his name because of her complaint about dizziness he diagnosed her with an inner ear infection he prescribed a medicine that after three days was doing her absolutely no good she ended up going to her own physician who told her that the medicine prescribed would not cure the problem but instead only prolong it in addition this md pushed very hard on her abdomen and when she said it hurt he suggested that she needed to have her gall bladder removed this is the very first time we encountered a doctor trying to up sell on a medical procedure her own doctor told her that there was nothing wrong with her gall bladder and that it hurt because he pushed so hard and nothing else finally when she told him about cramps she was getting in her leg he completely ignored her as i said never ever again at this facility
above the door when you enter it says you will find truth inside and the truth is its awful at kazimierz made reservations for at peters food spot cowboy ciao also put down my creditcard to hold a spot for at kazimierz for nye dinner was great i dropped a grand on it lrb overpriced for atmosphere rrb walked into kazimierz where the owner peter and the bouncer treated us like we were here to wash the windows very very rude owner and bouncer they lost our name off the list then stuck us in a waiting area by the front and tried to pawn it off as our intended reserved private table no dice kaz we are off to another bar ps the comped champaign was flat big let down big attitude
allow me to be an asshole for a moment while i write this terrible review maybe its because it was monday and raining maybe it was because i was in the mood for humble pie and not mexican grill maybe its because restaurants in arizona do nt have the freshest sea food in the united states of america whatever it was i hated this place i have this habit of asking my server what their favorite thing on the menu is and usually i go with it i am adventurous i like surprises so homegirl suggested the nachos or the seared ahi tacos so what do i do  i ordered a taco plate since i like variety i mixed and matched and went with a fish  pork taco with black beans the ahi tasted wicked old and nasty fishy i almost spit it out but i am a lady and that is rude the pork was very undercooked i do nt know about you but i have absolutely no interest in catching trichinosis i can think of better ways to spend my day than with nausea diarrhea vomiting fatigue fever and abdominal discomfort sorry those are not things i am interested in thanks anyway though beans were served cold and i swear the rice they served was something out a box from the dollar store my dog could make better rice than that there was shit floating in my water and the limes i asked for were so dried out that not one drop of juice came out seriously  cut up some fresh ones its the little things that count service was slow but the chick was nice enough one of the girls i went with knew one of the managers who was supposed to hook us up with an employee discount but conveniently forgot about us at the end but what are you gonna do nothing is free anymore i dunno i just was nt impressed the only thing i dug about this joint were the tiles on the wall and im certainly not going to return to a place to stare at a wall next
sorry peter piper your pizza is outdated and made up of processed ingredients this is my first and last time ordering i ordered large topping w  wings  liter soda the wings were ok but that was nt the main focus it was the pizza which has no flavor and is bulky

my friend and i were looking for a late dinner delivery and decided on pita pit as it was already pm i called the number twice and it just rang and rang third time someone finally picked up and i could barely hear her because their rap music was playing so loud i ordered a philly and a caesar pita a side of hummus and pita lrb enough to feed people rrb and cokes the ordering itself took minutes because the women could nt hear me and did nt understand that i wanted pita with nothing on it to dip into the sides of hummus minutes later lrb my friends home is only miles away from pita pits location rrb a guy comes with our order i close the door and realize i did nt get any drinks but by then he d sped off i call back and explain that not only did we not get drinks but upon further inspection we got cookies instead of extra pita the guy had a thick mexican accent and did nt seem to understand what i was saying again there was music playing so loud in the background that i had to yell so he could hear me he tells me they did nt charge me for the drinks so basically why should i care lrb at a total of for two sandwiches they obviously charged me for it rrb i tell him that i d like the pita and drinks and he then mumbles shit while trying to find my order he says there s no drinks on the order lrb i have a copy of the order that has my drinks and pita scribbled at the botom rrb but he can see if they can get the driver to come back he says he ca nt and that s when i go crazy i work as a food delivery service dispatcher so i know that its almost mandatory to send a driver back if they have forgotten something i tell him this and he says no i then tell him when they do bring my order that i want my money back for the horrible f  cking service this man then tells me to watch my mouth and to not talk shit to him i repeat that i will be getting my money back and if they do nt come in a timely fashion that i ll drive down there and make a formal complaint minutes later no drinks no pita i call back and get a girl again i explain who talked to me last and she goes that little f  cker i know who that was i m again asked if i want them to bring our drinks lrb yes rrb and she puts the delivery man on he explains that no one told him to make his way back down and that he will and it will be thirty minutes i tell him we ll just come down cause that s too long to wait he then tells me it ll be more like and asks if i m sure i want him to come by with just drinks lrb yes rrb minutes later lrb midnight on the dot rrb i get my drinks and pita lrb pita to share between people rrb and he looked totally uninterested in apologizing for the hours of bull the food was good lrb who knows if they spit in anything because with the way they were acting its quite possible rrb but that part of the experience was totally trumped by the horrid customer service
i have been going to the openair saturday market for a while but have never gone into the store i have always had a pleasant time and the sellers are always friendly and helpful in contrast to the friendly merchants outside the grocery store people were not at least not to me and the person i was with answering a question seemed like a chore to the girl behind the counter then the cashier although superbly pleasant to the person checking out before us did not provide the same to us we are probably not the kind of customers they like or are used to  i ll probably continue to go to the openair saturday market but definitely skip the store
scale of  lrb single visit rrb na food  drinks  service atmosphere value hazelwoods had the major misfortune of treating a table full of yelpers like crap lrb not rudely just poorly rrb i was here for the uye book club  and it was fun and thought provoking the yelpers that came to this were also fun and interesting enter hazelwood because of course the world s energy must remain balanced we were left unattended for long stretches of time i had to actively wave her down to get anything at all the food took forever i wo nt go into the minute details but let it suffice to say that my jagerbomb orders were a mess and a half kym c never got her food  or even her water my seat was unable to see any tv so every time the bar erupted into cheers i had to turn and hope for a replay lrb usacanada gold medal match rrb in a sports bar there should not be a single seat that ca nt see a tv it s called planning add that it s not light rail accessible and i really ca nt come up with any way that i d end up here again
sucks
everything about this place is disgusting
we were referred to great spaces through ikea when we were looking to update our kitchen initially justin schmitt was very helpful with ideas and patient with our changes then things went wrong  a  day installation dragged out for weeks  our special order faucet was broken during teardown or rebuild  when they could nt find an exact replacement they installed a much lesser faucet and gave us a small credit off of the balance due the value of the new faucet  the credit equals about half of what our previous faucet the one they broke cost  their plumber damaged the reverseosmosis filtration system under our sink we had to call a specialist in to fix it great spaces did ultimately credit us for that bill but only after a hassle justin  david actually told us that they did us a favor by not charging us to hook it up in the first place somehow a system that hooks up to the water line and flows water does nt count as the plumbing that they quoted reinstalling even though it was in place when justin quoted doing it  they quoted removing our overrange wallmounted microwave and installing a provided vent hood in it s place aside from adding several days to the job we had to haggle about the install and the resulting installation left not only a bad drywall patch job but i had to relevel the hood as it was hung crooked  they quoted installing ikea countertops on our kitchen island and they told us that there would be a small seam down the middle what they did nt tell us though was that the seam would be wavy and uneven and that worse the ends of the tops would not match so each end of the island has steps sticking out where they do nt line up it looks like a wannabe handy man s first attempt at a discount home improvement job rather than the professional install we were paying for justin not only told me that this was ikea s quality standard and there s nothing more they would do about it but that he had personally worked it out for us to get a full refund on the counter tops from ikea as it turns out that was just a lie to get us to pay the final installment of their bill further the issue is nt with the counter tops  the issue is with their hackjob installation it s been less than weeks since they finished the install that began on may th i ve already had to replace of the drawer handles they installed because the screws were stripped out and readjust most of the large pull out drawers to stop rubbing  dragging if i have any other issues i definitely will not be expecting great spaces to resolve them  i do nt think they re capable
worst breakfast experience of my life i come from the restaurant industry and usually cut people a good deal of slack after my breakfast being prepared incorrectly times the owner refused to apologize and said that my breakfast only went back to the kitchen twice i will not be going back
the poor quality of the products alone makes this place not worth it processed cheese on a breakfast bagel  not sure what happened to this egg patty the bagels taste good but are chewy and too dry on the outside sure it s cheap food but you get what you pay for a slimy breakfast bagel
we have been coming here for years loved the food and the ambience until tonight this was suppose to be a special night out for our daughter before she headed off to college we decided to sit in the bar area bad idea if you want to be served food quickly we ordered our dinner at at our waitress came by to apologize for how long it was taking apparently there was a private party with people in the area next to us and the food was taking a while that was a little hard to believe as there was a family of sitting in the restaurant area who got bread and were served long before us and we did nt get any bread our food finally arrived at my daughter and i ordered the salmon my husbandthe steak the salmon was supposed to have a citrus marinade no citrus flavor was to be found and it was very dry my husband s steak was so over done and dry he did nt even want to bring the leftover home to our dog we expressed our disappointment to the waitresswho was very nice and apologized she mentioned the chef is new and we are not the first people to complain about the food we did get a small discount for the meal but unfortunately will not be back
we ordered the italian beef with giardiniera and were very disappointed we each took a couple of bites and ended up throwing the rest away and going elsewhere for dinner the giardiniera was nothing but diced jalapenos and zucchini we could nt taste anything but jalapenos we re big fans of spicy food but there s more to giariniera than jalapenos the meat was very tough and dry overall we were very very disappointed
shc has the best cleanest er but if you get submitted to the hospital it s the worst hospital ever i wo nt bore you with the many complaints i had during my stay but if you can avoid being submitted to this hospital do whatever you can going back when i was being taken to the er i would have taken a longer trip if that meant i could have stayed at a better hospital so just one of the bajillion complaints i have about this hospital is they are under staffed and the nurses are witches after my surgery i had to pee lrb sorry if that s tmi rrb but i could nt get to the bathroom on my own so i paged a nurse no one came around for an hour towards the end of that hour i was paging the nurses every two seconds still nada finally i grabbed my cell phone called and had them connect me with the hospital i spoke with a receptionist and had to ask her if someone would please come to my room to help me it was after that a nurse actually came to help me can you believe that  there are a lot of elderly people in this part of town too and they probably would have just been left there to crap all over themselves or been ignored if you have a grandparent or know an older person staying here get them transferred other issues in the eyes of someone on pain meds  they did nt toast my bagel and it made me cry through tears i said to my sister  they did nt toast my bagel and then i m pretty sure i through it on the floor but that parts a bit blurry  they did nt knock before barging into my room in the middle of the night which scared me and made me cry through tears i said  can you please knock  issues not related to pain meds  you have to share a room yuck my roommate was a farter  the nurses are evil they do nt pay attention to the needles and tubes inside of your skin when they go to take your blood pressure imagine having those ripped out of your arm bc the nurse is nt paying attention  in order to leave they make the head dr or nurse or something check you out we waited hours waiting for the nurse person while the nurses kept telling us to hold on it should be soon and then we found out it was nt necessary and they finally let us leave  the nurses argue see conversation below samantha  are you in pain  do you need more pain meds   yes  you must not be in pain if you re sleeping  i m not asleep  your eyes are closed  ummm i m responding are nt i  i m not asleep  well if you were in pain it would be impossible for you to lay here calmly  can you please stop arguing with me  i am in pain so please stop arguing with me 
i would never reccommend this location to anyone first i had to wait ten minutes to get to order my food when i get up i start my order then he went silent said im sorry what was that again so i went over half the order and he never replied back i said hello and no reply about mins later he wants me to announce my order again one car was in front of me place was not busy i worked in the food service for years thru college and never had something like this happen at my places if it did i would have been fired after i make the order and get to the window mins after i decided to go here and not wendys next door he tells the only car infront of me to pull forward well he only pulled so far forward or he would be in oncoming traffic but yet it wasnt far enough for my door car to get out and around when i told the guy that took my order i didnt have time to wait more mins and how long would my food take before i paid him he said should be ready in mins mins later the guy in front of me gets out of his car walks in and takes bag of food at the same time i turned and this guy gave me my food so for about mins took me for a order of two combos and they call it fast food the guy didnt even address the situation just said sorry for the delay i wrote churchs chicken website and never heard back i also called and they said the manager was not there he would call me back never heard back horrible store dont go with that service they will have to shut down unless they revamp the staff worst experience in my life
i m truly glad to see someone has had a better experience at al s than myself based on this latest review might i go back there now  absolutely the first day we have a blizzard in july in phoenix with degrees below zero wind chill lrb no offense to cookie who wrote that review is intended rrb
do nt waste your money this is the worst buffet that i ve ever had dining area is big and beautiful but the food court is very small and not many food for you to choose for my friend kept apologizing to me because he felt so bad taking me there
i m a very honest consumer and i just moved to a new apartment very close to this restaurant i wanted to give it a try and order some food to go we order some kung pao chicken chicken low mein and the house fried rice we go home and i open my fried rice all excited and it was chunks of steam rice with a few brown colors here and there of soy sauce it tasted it like some paste of sticky steam rice and soy sauce it was the worst fried rice i ever tasted in my life and i m an expert about fried rice because i order it everywhere i go i had really good ok and soso fried rice but this one was reaaaaaaaly bad i also make fried rice myself and i was like should i just fix it and try to cook the fried rice that i just ordered  but there was not even a way to fix it because it was just a ball of paste sticky steam rice i called them and ask them very in a very polite way what happened  they said well it must be the soy sauce that did nt go all the way into the steam rice  that made no sense they do nt know how to make fried rice at all i asked them if they could deliver something else since i paid for all the items like bucks and they said they only deliver orders over dollars i was like yeah and i just paid bucks forget it i told them that i was going to drive back all the way to their restaurant and exchange it for something else i exchanged it for the zzechuan chicken it was nt even that good not so bad but nothing amazing i hate to say this but i ll never ever go back here overall service good food really bad tasteless i do nt even think that the cooks are real cooks with experience in food
the restaurant here is horrible the food is okay nothing special but not awful however the service is probably the worst i have ever experienced i went with a group of coworkers and the waiter repeatedly screwed up he forgot our orders and had to come back and ask brought somebody the wrong drink and somebody else got the wrong entree and to top it off he charged us for more food than we actually ordered luckily one of my coworkers caught the mistake we talked to the manager and he gave us extra game cards which really did nt make up for the horrible service but at least it was something i do not recommend this place for food
oh dear american auto you should have treated me better i trusted them to replace my front windshield with the original glass that my toyota came with you promised you did but when it got dinged on the freeway one week after i just bought the windshield from you it was very questionable that you did in the first place how could i tell it was such poor quality glass that you installed for me  well for starters all the hits from rocks that i had gotten on my original windshield were just small circularlike marks but with yours they just became long streaks that ran across the car like bad panty hose when they got dinged twice i took the car back to this shop immediately after the marks and explained to them that although i understand it is not their fault that my car got dinged but it is very unusual that the marks would looks like that only poor quality glass would not be able to withstand the very small rock my car took i asked if there was anything they could possibly do for me any sort of warranty anything at all since i gave them just last week and this happened the body shop guy calls up the guy that installed my windshield i can totally hear both ends since his cell phone is so loud the installation guy basically said it s not their problem and too bad the body shop guy attempts to use some sort of material to make the crack look less intense i works for a while but after a week goes by it does nt look like he did anything at all they said that if i were to buy another windshield from them to replace this one they would take  off i m sorry but as good as that  bargain sounds it s not a good deal at all i m out for a crappy quality windshield that you put in my car in the first place you should replace that for free or better yet refund me maybe driving away in your bmw and thinking that i m not going to review your ripoff business was a huge mistake so sad how businesses think they can get away with installing shitty products and not think that you would notice it wow never thought i would curse on yelp but looks like it s a first now
do not get glass here i called this company a week in advance hoping they could fix my window the repair man came over and dropped my old broken window he made an effort to clean it up but when he left my dog managed to cut his foot on the shards of glass that was left out carpet even has blood stains anyways the repair man dropped another window in his truck so he told me he could nt install my new window today cuz that was the last one i asked if he could just come back to fix it because i was waiting for hours for him he did nt want to make the long drive i called the glas teks phone number hoping for some help or maybe a different repair man the only thing they said was to wait till the next day yeyy another night in the cold for me i called a different local company and it was cheaper dont go through glas tek
its official neiman marcus is in a horrible slump in men s fashion sure you can get a nice suit but where ca nt you they never have any decent designers no matter how many times you suggest it to the managers every walk into the men s section is a slap of midlife crisis in your face just nasty
i lost all interest in going here after a big cockroach crawled across our table a little before the nachos were delivered and yes we still ate after seeing that i left traumatized
wish i could give them a better rating my husband and i are big fans of kona grill  well not anymore after spending on dinner the only thing that was not bad was the drinks but how can you mess up beer from the tap  the service was okay our waiter kept our waters full so that was good the food  awful we first got the egg rolls which were over cooked and dry but ya know we are not too pick of eaters so we ate them then entrees were the worst part my husband got the  po boy and i got my normal the steak flatbread the po boy was made with soft shell crab or so it says  well what my husband got was not crab it was slimy raw and so gross my flatbread which i typically love was overcooked and just hard to eat  it was like chomping on cardboard we ate what we could and left  because my husband is not the type to send food back the next day i decided to call and talk to management about it seeing that not only was the food awful but my husband was up all night with a stomach ache  and this is a man who has a stomach of steel the manager on duty explained that new management is on board and they are trying to get business back  well serving what they did to us is doing opposite they offered us a free appetizer  well thanks  but that is not worth the we spent they should have offered us our meals over or a refund needless to say we will not be back  and i encourage anyone in the area to eat elsewhere like yard house or mellow mushroom
i wish this place had decent food i live in the neighborhood and would visit regularly if it did on the occasion i do stop in for a draft beer i always leave disappointed my new rule stop for a beer and the view but do not order food
just an okay evening
i got a groupon for mellow mushroom wanting to try it out after hearing good reviews of the pizza when we got there we were seated quickly and got asked by two different people if we wanted drinks after getting our drinks we ordered our food and that s where the good feelings quickly changed while the pizza itself was good the service was by far the worst i have ever experienced our waitress did nt return for over minutes between when she placed our order and brought the check not once did she check on us to make sure everything was good or to see if we needed anything i had to ask one of the busboys for a refill on my drink because the waitress never bothered to come by lrb or to the other two tables by us rrb i had high hopes for my big out but after this experience i wo nt be back perhaps just takeout if i m in the mood for the pizza
this would be the ideal stop if you were on a scavenger hunt because any and all pop culture trash has been stuck on the wall shelf or is hanging from the ceiling or parked outside omg hoarder heaven the food was okay yet i ate very skeptically half expecting a cockroach to climb onto the table i actually liked the hamburger there were wings too but i m not a fan of those  soaked in enough sauce i ll eat though there are skinny carrot sticks with thin and runny buttermilk dressing for dip on the side of each wing order there were families at the next table with a whiny child and dad yelling at her for most of our meal  how annoying was that it appeared there was only one restroom for everyone and we chose not to go there to wash our hands of all the wing grease and sauce
i had the most horrible shopping experience here today i went to go get a new pair of jeans and when i walked in the sales associate came up to me and asked if he could help he then proceeded to argue with me about what size i am he finally let me try on a size that is one size smaller than i wear i tried them on while the whole time he stood outside of the dressing room telling me about how everyone calls him the jean guy and that i should tell all my friends to come get their jeans from him after i tried on the jeans that were so tight i could barely breath he then told me that i could not try on a size larger i was so livid i threw the jeans down and walked out i will never go back and i will not be telling my friends about the jean guy 
shame on zipps for opposing a new z tejas at bethany home and th st afraid of a little competition
this place used to be one of my favorite places to eat i worked close by so it was convenient and the prices were all ways good even though its not the fanciest of places the food was always filling and yummy i recently moved and would still make the min drive to get it but this last time i went every thing seemed to taste different the jalapeno dipping sauce for the baby banditos which were a favorite of mine is completely different and not very tasty unfortunately i wont be making the trip again
i work and live in the area and thought this would be a great place to chill and enjoy a frozen treat now that its been open a few months i have to admit that i was wrong the yogurt itself is mediocre and a bit pricey but at least the place itself is very comfortable and inviting lrb and always clean rrb they have lost my business because the ownermanager is a very unpleasant gentleman who knows nothing about customer service he seems to delight in being mean to his young employees and then turns his bad attidude on his customers overall 
walked in as i needed a simple nail polish change which i figured i did nt have to do too much searching since it was so basic i think i got the owner lrb a woman rrb as she was the only one not wearing a white coat and had an air about her that she was the boss anyhow i asked how much a polish change was and i was told for my hands for my feet i thought that was a bit steep but it s been a while since i ve just gotten a polish change so i chalked it up to inflation i was seated quickly and she proceeds to take of my finger nail polish i say attempt cause apparently she was having a difficult time lrb i had good polish on and it was nt coming off as easily as she had hoped she gets frustrated after a few seconds and proceeds to take the drill out wth  so i tell her i have natural nails and do nt want my nails drilled if she needs me to take off the polish i will lrb cause she was obviously annoyed at the fact that it was nt coming right off rrb she says nothing and goes back to rubbing her cotton ball on them a few seconds pass lrb yes literally seconds rrb and she gets irritated again and reaches for her drill this time i told her firmly that i did nt want her to use the drill she kind of aggressivly pushed the drill away and proceeds to try and pick off the polish with her nails ok yes the polish was tougher than usual but honestly it was nt that serious i ve had other techs take it off wo getting their panties in a bunch and it was rather alarming that she was so ticked by it then as she s working away i start looking around and see they have a price chart on the table and also on the wall i scan the prices on the table which do nt mention the cost of a polish change so i look on the wall and see the polish change is cheaper than what she quoted me finding this a bit odd i ask her if her prices have changed and she says yes points to the one on her table and says they ve gone up so i compare the services she has listed on the table chart to those on the wall and they re exactly the same at this point i m feeling a bit scammed and annoyed but since i need to get this polish changed for a wedding i was attending shortly i figured i d just stick it out for the few extra bucks i had to pay she finishes up my hands and tells me to go sit in one of their pedicure seats to do the polish change on my toes i asked if i could leave my shoes on lrb i had sandals on rrb because i d need to leave quickly and i did nt want to ruin my hands or feet trying to put my sandals back on or dig through my purse she looks down at my feet and shakes her head yes lrb again looking irritated rrb so i get situated in the pedi chair i thought it was a nice touch for her to put a towel under my toes so that nothing gets wet when she doused the polish remover on my feet and all was good until i left the place and my toes were sticking to my shoes since the liquid soaked through anyways once i got back to the hotel and was getting ready for the wedding i attempted to take my shoes off only to find the polish remover actually bleached my shoes and my feet were stained from the color of my soles needless to say i do nt live in phoenix anymore so i never have to return but for those of you who do i hope i can help shed light on a place where you may or may not get good service and a nasty attitude to boot
this place serves some sort of food but it is not mexican please please avoid the grease bomb served here if you must go across the street to the in n out burger joint nassssttyyyy
i d hate to waste a star on this place i lived right outside of the french quarter in new orleans for months i remember the best of cajun food and this place was far from what i remember i m not big on seafood but everyone at our table ordered a seafood dish and all were not happy with their entree what did i order  i ordered a simple chicken po  boy sandwich how can a cajun restaurant get this wrong  this place did the chicken was placed on bread that was hard i expected the chicken to be smothered in bbq sauce wrong the sauce was on the side the lettuce on the side of dish that was to be used in the sandwich was a bit on the brown side the fries were cold yuck waitress was great she was the best part of this dining experience never again
update if you are a under the control of city property management and if you ever leave your requests to utilize the media center or the club house with anyone other than the assistant manager make sure you check on the status with them in person last week i left applications with vimbai lrb the one i praised as the only professional working the desk    rrb and the next day when i confirmed with vickielucky i didthe applications were stapled in the book  however the dates were never reserved for me kind of weird since she pretty much sits there doing nothing but homework once again this is not a property management company for properties that want work done help for their tenants or management of their properties i spoke with vickie regarding my use of the media center for last sundayinforming her that i would be using the grillbut still the propane tanks were empty we had to refill them ourselves plus the party from the friday before left trash cans full of garbage and trash on the inside tables and oddly enough after leaving the placein what i thought was a spotless conditioni received a call from the front desk at pm sunday because there were specks of what could have been tomato on the floor makes me wonder why they neglected to notice the overflowing trash cans and the trash on the tables just the day before  this management company is still discriminating  i wonder if they realize its against the law  update this is the second time utilizing the media center at the landmark towers which requires a deposit and the front desk lrb even after contacting the main property manager rrb still lacks the knowledge of accessing the ac but weird enough the ac kicked on right before pm lrb the media center closes at am rrb it was a hot box one so hot we had to leave the door propped open how funny they have two pool tables sets of billiards balls and only working cue stick the hoa costs for a bedroom unit is about a month and they ca nt keep the equipment up to date go figure if your looking for a great property management company one that will take care of your property and look after your tenants like it was their own keep on looking this company is not a great management company at all they currently manage the units i m residing at in central phoenix and they lack all the qualities you look for in a management company they have assistant managers in place that are so consumed with job security  that they poorly train their employeesi think on purpose the current manager at my unit has not shared the procedures for turning on the ac in the media room and summer is lurking around the corner lrb it costs deposit too rrb they cast judgement based on your cultural background or sexual preference  as one of my neighbors lrb he lives higher than the th floor too rrb was told he had to hand deliver his trash to the garbage receptacle outside the building she watched him do this daily until after the th time i watched him walk it down that was when i finally told him that each floor has trash chutes near the elevator when i brought this to the attention of her manager it was dismissed secondly in our ccr s it states that you can not give your fob to anyone not a relative or friend however she told my bathtub refinisher today that she was nt going to open the door for him lrb he had to make trips for his equipment rrb and that he should ask me for my fob this is the company that is supposed to be enforcing the rules and regulations lucky for me i read through the entire packet because she is already known for entrapping people  as just the other day she entrapped one of my neighbors for merely smoking a hookah in her unit another horrible thing about this company is the lack of follow through they will ignore the meat and potatoes of your email or written complaints and then act condescending towards you and your friends steer clear of this company i have included links to other complaints regarding the city property management company do nt get involved with them unless your ready for a barrage of complaints and law suits oh yeah did i mention that all your business will be shared with each other tenant  as they still think this is high school and they act like the cheer leading captain turned mean girl good luck httptinyurlco httptinyurlco httptinyurlco

ever heard the saying jack of all trades master of none its a donut shop its a deli its a cafe its a family restaurant its an asian fast food place well we found out differently we were looking for something different for lunch so turned to yelp and decided to try the ninja bowl then found there is no place with this name no street sign no door marker legend no mailbox nothing we had to do some hunting and asking lrb i hate asking rrb and found out the truth there are four names on yelp for the same address and same location rrb ninja bowl httpwwwyelpcombizninjabowlphoenix aka rrb rainbow donuts bakery  cafe httpwwwyelpcombizrainbowdonutsbakeryandcafephoenix aka rrb rainbow donuts  deli httpwwwyelpcombizrainbowdonutsanddeliphoenix aka rrb bobby c s cafe httpwwwyelpcombizbobbycscafephoenix ok it took a bit of hunting walking around the building times and we finally asked so found it now to ordering lunch i did nt even look at the menu because i ve read the yelp reviews of jesse and darren so think i m informed in a decisive sweep of confidence i ask for the chipotle bowl and get blank stares they do nt know what this is i finally look at the menu and its not there i order the closest thing the sizzling bowl it arrives and is just what i ordered a bowl of rice some chopped small chicken smothered in spicy sauce with a few jalapenos add a small drink and i m at with tax although plentiful it was just ok absent of any veggies but then again all of the bowls are just meat rice and sauce except the veggie bowl the girls from the office that i took here for lunch glared at me this is not the good glare either ps  a day later the charge showed up on my credit card online statement as bobby c s cafe
i was so infuriated last night i could nt even write this review apparently this has been in effect for a while but as a student that uses the student discount i am usually studying and not at the movie theater every night this also means my schedule is completely filled if i m not in classes gettin the academics learned i m working at the job i m thankful to have in this shithole economy this means when i can squeeze an hour or two into my hecticstressful schedule for a movie it may not be on a thursday if you re that desperate for money bigman corporation why do nt you put a donation box in front of the theater  what  you do nt think anyone would put donations in the box for amc  well that s probably because you already ass rape the public on ticket prices and now you re doing it without lube by limiting the student discount to only thursdays i agree with amanda b go to harkins long live the freedom for students to go to the movies whenever they damn well please and be allowed to save some coin off the ticket price and put toward the overpriced food at the concession stand or hell i may be a little crazy here but lets do the super saver cinema lrb dollar theater rrb on bell road and i yes they are nt a dollar theater any more they are a two dollar theater but at least they are nt punching me in the pocket book  repeatedly oh yeah and deer valley amc  your parking lot is major suckage
i am unfortunately writing with a horrendous review of youew of the food because i was not even able to eat due to the horrible greeting i was given by both the manager and district manager of your establishment let me set the scene for you i was supposed to eat dinner with my two children my parents and my brother and his wife they had all raved about how great sauce was we arrived and my parents immediately got in line and i sat down with my two boys ages three and five i figured by sitting down and occupying the children with toys they would be less likely to interrupt the other diners right away a rather surly un attractive manager got right in my face to tell me i was not allowed to sit down ok  she then went on to explain the rules of the restaurant  as she put it i totally understand trying to set up a restaurant  i worked in the restaurant industry for eight years  i have eaten all over the world  i get it what i do not get is being treated like i am at mcdonald s and i am thirteen years old i then spoke with the district manager and she was just as rude all in all pretty disappointing because we left sauce and went across the street to another establishment  now this morning i am sitting here craving pizza and i am going to have to go to oreganos unbelievable what poor service  twenty times worse than eating any where else in the valley too bad for both you and i because north used to be one of my favorite places in the valley and now i am a little tainted in my view of fox restaurants well  i hope that manager goes back to working at taco bell and sauce goes back to being an inviting place to eat
this review can not comment on the food at alexi s because frankly we left we patiently waited for over minutes for a waiter to ask us about drinks or bring a menu no dice they seemed understaffed and had a large group but that is no excuse for completely ignoring a table i was also shocked at the causal attire of some of the guests i realize its summer and all but the table next to us one gentleman was in a white tank top not my expectation for this type of restaurant so while we did nt dine at alexi s we did patron the owner s other restaurant and had a wonderful experience lrb as we always do rrb
the first time i went there and sat at the counter for minutes they just stared at me and would not come up and take my order the second time i went there i brought a young lady with me and we sat at a table while we were being served my date became upset because the owner or manager lrb an older man rrb was making loud racial jokes and kept looking over at us i ve never been back there again and when i mentioned it to a friend of mine he said he got the same treatment and will never go there again
this lenny s location is horrible the fries appeared to have been sitting in old grease or just old i asked if they were fresh and she indicated yes they were horrible will never eat at w glendale location again they are not like the other locations please mark my words they do nt even deserve star they did nt even get order correct to begin with had to return burger
i do not understand why people are saying this is the best carne asada they ve ever had this place is really horrible it was like having my old high school cafeteria making me tacos absolutely no flavor in the meat no flavor in condiments on taco or taco shell or sauce the amount of meat was very small the chips and salsa was like it was from taco bell or something the only flavorful thing i had there was the mexican bottled coke that was way overpriced even the ambiance was low grade uncomfortable chairs and no personality i am actually angry about this place getting good reviews it is soooo easy to take beef marinate it and grill it up and make it delicious maybe the people who think this is the best carne asada should go to the closest roach coach and get a real carne asada taco it would be cheaper and times better
cheeeeziest place to spend time along with eli s same people  but different names hang out at these places crappy drinks and the bar staff put other peoples drinks on your bill yikes one of the bands that plays there is good  but mainly too loud this place made me want to go back home lay on my sofa take my tv remote control and watch celebrity rehab the people who frequent this place are ummm ummmm wtf where in the world are they from  gross the food slides off the table either alive still or greasy and nasty my chin got  moisturized eating that crap i ordered a vodca cranberry and got a super red  carcinogentic something that looked like coolaid and tasted like rubbing alchohol and nail polish i think the word  eeeew is the best word to describe this low class bar and sorry i am jumping out on a limb here but the people are pretty darn ugly and drunk that i saw there i saw a woman s naked crotch in there and a guy rubbing himself in there hey do nt kill the messenger i m just sayin
been here twice  both times were horrible the front desk staff especially the receptionist is very rude  condescending the doctor is not the greatest the wait is extremely long  not worth the wait at all they do nt admit when they re wrong or apologize when they screwed up your order beware
the first time i had met ryan was at the east valley bridal show and i liked what i saw of his designs they seemed very creative and well priced not to mention i had off my order from a prize wheel when i was ready to start my invitations i called and left a message with the owner for ryan to call me back nothing a week later i called him back and he was out when he finally did get back to me i set a time that i was going to come in and discuss the design i was hoping to get upon meeting him he made me feel like he could practically design anything i wanted wrong first of all he gave me a day to expect a proof from him and nothing lrb noticing a pattern  rrb i had to call him and track down my proof when i finally did receive the proof it was a mess at this point i should have found another place to get my wedding invites but i wanted to give them another chance i responded with the changes i would like to make and told him that at this point i needed them to be done in a week and a half well what do you know no response when he finally did get back to me about days later his lame excuse was that he does nt check the email i sent it to everyday well then why would you only give that email as a contact for yourself  in the end i am not sure what his issue was delivering a simply designed invitation for my upcoming wedding in a reasonable amount of time i ended up going to a chain office supply store lrb against my own better judgment rrb and ended up with a custom designed invitation that is beautiful in less than a day i think it is time for this business to find a new head of the print shoppe lrb like ashlee  rrb rrb or cut that part of their business out all together
i do nt even know where to start i guess ill start by pointing out what i liked it s nice small and cozy the decor is not cheesy the service was mediocre oh and the prices they were fairly cheap four of us ate lrb no drinks rrb for about i would like to state that i did not have a bad experience with bad service or anything along those lines ok now that i ve said that i have nt the slightest of ideas why this place has a star rating if the rating was based solely on price and service then yes by all means this place deserves a star review i m starting to believe all the other reviews were from friends of the owner or got payed for their review we waited minutes to be seated our waitress was well average and our food came out fairly quick there was absolutely nothing special about any of the rolls we ordered they were all bland and extremely plain tasting there was no difference in taste from one roll to the other even the vegas roll was bland its a vegas roll i have never had a bad vegas roll my friend and i have never left a sushi roll uneaten well except from an allucaneat lrb and thats just because we could nt fit any more down our throat rrb we left sushi we were still hungry but it was just not worth the effort to chew something that tasted like paper as i ve said if the rating was only based on service and price yes i would give it a  but i do nt care how great the service is or how cheap the food is if it taste like well i do nt want to say crap because that has a distinct taste this was more along the lines of plain cardboard i recommend you go anywhere else tokyo loby yen sushi shoot go to sprouts and buy one of those little premade sushi boxes not worth the wait and i would probably not return even if it was free
while visiting from california we went to a few bars downtown and were pleased with all except acme this was the absolute worst bar i have ever been to it took forever to get a drink from the tool of a bartender then some nasty chick with std s written all over her was dancing on the bar next to our bottled beers my boyfriend and i decided to walk upstairs to get away from it all only to be stopped by what assumed to be a bouncer whom was sitting on a couch he told us females only upstairs though we saw males up there later to be told by the bartender you have to have a vagina or act like you have a vagina we left after one beer and went to saddleranch where we had an absolute blast
purses junk jewelry junk shoes junk i came here specifically looking for purses and what they had were either soccer mom or old granny purses i saw some purses that were a little better but they were overpriced i think even walmart has a better and nicer selection of jewelry and that is not saying very much shoe selection was shabby not a looker in sight
never got our food we had to tell the waitress we were leaving then the manager brought our food at least they did nt charge us
was not very impressed with our visit with one of the doctors at this clinic the front desk staff was friendly and welcoming but our experience with the doctor was nt great she did nt introduce herself when she came into the exam room and did nt ask my name no handshake nothing it seemed that she guessed at a diagnosis for our dog s injury did nt seem too interested in finding the real problem she suggested very pricey treatment for the guessed diagnosis went to a different vet today for a second opinion and the exam was much more thorough much more thorough the diagnosis today was completely different than the diagnosis given from desert hills and it was nt a guess the vet i went to for the second opinion spent enough time with my dog to make a proper diagnosis he also found a problem with my dog s hind leg  which was examined by the desert hills doctor who did nt mention any problem would nt recommend this place
oh this was not good a server brought bread to our table for three with a small dish of butter lrb  rrb we had no plates or silverware when i asked a waiter if we could have plates she said lrb with a straight face rrb we do nt have any plates we have large plates for the meal but no small plates if we get some i ll bring them to you i said do you have silverware  she said yes could we have some  oh ok sure the food  stay home make a bologna sandwich lrb on a plate rrb and enjoy yourself
i was visiting a friend and craving del taco as i have nt had it in forever we pulled up to the drive thru and no one said anything we thought they were closed because the parking lot was rather empty i told my friend just to say hello and see if anyone answered she did in no way rude at all just a simple hello girl came on and responded with major attitude yeah can you give me a minute  friend replied sorry but if you had said something so i knew you were even there i would have def given you a minute girl then said ok then now you can give me three minutes wow talk about shitty service i decided to take my business elsewhere i live on the east coast and love del taco so much but that girl made it so not worth it to me i mean i m from jersey and i have never experienced such ignorance really just disgusting
this was our first time at this restaurant we went later in the evening when the place was almost empty the food was ok nothing to get excited about we were disappointed in how long it took the waiter to get back to us to take our order we had to ask someone to go get him our waiter proceeded to sit down at the table next to us after we received our food and visited the entire time with what it seemed like old family friends sure he would get up now and then and refill our tea however we were unimpressed with this type of service he also had other tables besides ours to wait on we know all about his personal life when he is finishing up his schooling etc i guess we are spoiled by going to other places in town my husband said that with the way the economy is restaurants should be jumping to make sure the customers want to come back and eat at their establishment there are way to many good places to eat thank goodness we used a gift card that i received at christmas i ca nt imagine paying full price for the service we received we were disappointed but it would have been worse if we would have had to pay for the entire meal ourselves
went back today the casheir was rude and slow no name tag by the receipt said her name was rehana any way she sucked the food was sub parr and everything seemed to have a strong vinegar flavor
i am so appalled by this b and n i went in here to buy some gifts and had them gift wrapped with gift receipts the man who rung me up did nt do the gift receipts correct so the manager had to be called over the manager think his name was jeff was the rudest man i have encountered in so long he was so nasty to me and i was nothing but nice and patient he was mean to me for their mistakes i will not shop at this store anymore i told jeff that i did nt like how he was treating me and he still was rude shame on b and n to treat me that way
unfortunately i m still here  could nt wait to write this review bad service bad food small portions of over priced bad food in fact my wife s dish and my dish were so small that combined they would be a smaller lunch entre at most restaurants cafeteria style salad cafeteria scent in the air as you come into this pathetic establishment ordered lemonade  got crystal light if i could give it no stars i would
i recently dined here with some friends on a sunday and it will definitely be my last time the food took forever to got the drinks were mostly mixer i saw one previous comment on here that said they were virgin drinks that s a great description our waitress was a despondent little grouch who definitely had an expression on her face suggesting that she had somewhere better to be maybe she did i also do nt know why people keep saying great prices the margaritas are dollars the fast food chain chipotle is a better mexican food experience do not waste your money at cien agaves
unbelievable we stood here waiting for minutes to get to the counter while at the counter it took yet another minutes before we were given a rental car that we had already paid for and confirmed on line i can not understand how this avis rental car inside the airport is still in business it must only be in business because people coming from another location have never rented from avis rental car before
one star for lack of vendors i was really excited to hear that there would be a farmer s market but i m not sure they should call it that just yet it should be renamed to one farmer some hummus and some honey market aside from the great smells from the roast beef sammy s there was nothing there that interested me even the produce were lacking maybe apples a couple oranges you get the idea it took me a minute to see all that the market has to offer let s not advertise this until you get about vendors or so it was a huge disappointment
i did give this place a stars but very disappointed with my latest visit honestly i am very glad to see this store expands and getting lot more business since their expansion with cleaner interior and all but what happened to the quality  it seems they are putting less meat into the bowl these days and worst of all i found a hair in my pho today i understand with more people coming in you try to cut cost but at least keep it clean i am done with this place
so this is heartbreaking i ve been going to havana cafe for years and over looked a lot as far as decor and service but once the food goes so do i a friend who used to live here who was visiting suggested havana cafe for dinner since it was always great our food was not good it was ok at best and our service was lack luster  snotty really then they cleared our plates before we were done and started to vacuum while we were still eating if we were the only people keeping them there late which it was not late at all lrb and we were nt the only patrons there rrb i could understand but overall the service was poor right out the gate and our food was nt great so we will not be going back which breaks my heart since i ve had many good experiences in the past i always knew i was paying more but i figured it was worth it but i do nt think for people was worth that kind of poor service especially since so many places are closing up these days
so sad i have to give this local establishment star  but after attempts to enjoy a meal there i just ca nt do it captain we arrived for a late lunch at pm and were pleasantly surprised at happy hour in the middle of the day first off it smells like you just walked into the men s room in mexico when you first enter from the central avenue entrance  then it lingers making its way to the bar thinning out with each step until you get to a point where you just get used to it arriving at the bar my sister wanted to leave immediately but it was the only place big enough downtown phoenix to bring my bike inside so we toughed it outagain i torture myself only because i really want to give the downtown establishments a chance however the food killed it for me this time we ordered appetizers for the homemade salsa with chips and a side of sour cream should nt be that hard to do they won me half way with this because turns out the chips are homemadeand delicious but the salsa is pace picante if i d a known that i would have ordered something else the potato skins came out looking as if they were made previously then left sitting around for hours then recooked bacon and all they were dry and crumbly as heck and the ranch dressing was straight out of the bottle lrb the horribly tasting one rrb the salad was ok but the ranch made it worse my friend who was visiting from texas enjoyed her french toast so therein lies the star  breakfast at lunch time yay it looked okay nothing to rave about though since it had been almost years since we all seen each other  a shot was in order raspberry kamikazi s please what  you do nt know how to make a rasp kami  what a waste of a full bar luckily i knew the ingredients and the measurements  but funny thing is the bartender who said she did nt know how to make the drink kept insisting there was soda water even after explaining the recipe she added soda water  wtf  i have seen crowds waiting to see the murder mystery theater productions held there but i m not sure if i could stand the smell that long i have to regrettably say this will be my last attempt   
aw i ca nt vote zero stars  the service is the worst i ve ever had ever i asked for menus apparently not had to go physically get a menu from behind the bar asked to order and the waitress said she d be right back spent the next half hour trying to get her attention  no such luck when i finally got to order my food it was another half hour before i got to eat it i m sorry but when i go somewhere to eat i m hungry and i m not happy when i m hungry waiting over an hour to eat is just bad
terrible i brought my boyfriend here a while ago for a romantic date out i thought it would be great because they had vegetarian paella for me and plenty of fish and meat for him to try lrb he does nt normally get to do that too much since we go to mostly vegetarian places rrb we got an appetizer two entrees and some sangria and even with a gift card the bill was still over with tip now this would not have been an issue had the food been worth that however the food was terrible it was stuck in the s the beau s chicken looked like something you would get on an airplane and my paella could have been shown up by something in a box mushy rice with frozen veg the server also charged us for salads that she just brought out i do nt mind paying for a salad but at least ask me at one point in our meal my man got up and went to the restroom when he returned he told me that i had to go look at it it was awful it was worse than any drive bars i have been to the paint was falling off the walls one of the stalls did nt have a door and the other barely locked the toilets were filthy and the sink was disgusting if you charge  a plate you need to have the ambiance to back it up never go here
this place is always busy i do nt get it the burger is plain the fries are plain no pizazz no spice no unique flavors nada eating here is the theoretical equivalent of going to a dairy queen where the only thing on the menu is a vanilla cone
went here on  to find out they were taking a day weekend so i came back today the place was packed full of people wanting to returnexchange receivers as i was because i got fed up with not having the service being functional the only good things that actually came out of this minute wait was getting a brandnew cisco receiver which still didnt fix anything called em up and they refreshed the signal which helped for about minutes before screwing up some more now i have a scheduled technician visit tomorrow it ll probably either a crotchidy old man or a younger man telling me to quit complaining because there are less fortunate people who dont have cable even though i m paying dearly for my services once again i am very disappointed with cox communications wish me luck on the appointment  update  the cox tech lrb a stocky redheaded guy rrb finally got here an hour late and comes in with a hell of an attitude acting like he knew everything and the problem was my fault blaming the receiver not cox as well as being told on the phone that he would bring cords and a ladder upon getting here he said if it needed a new cord that i would have to schedule another time because he was on a schedule that didnt include that after all this bullcrap and proving the box was not entirely the problem he changed the head of one of the cords connected to my hd dvr it fixed the problem slightly so he went and changed the receiver and blamed the receiver for being glitchy new and giving off too much noise in the signal he finally got it working good enough he ran on out to his truck started to leave and i realized he left one of the other tv s and the modem still unplugged so i called him back in and upon repairing he growls and says god im soo stupid i left the other things unplugged i bet by now you think we probably just come in and fix one thing by breaking another well thats not how we work pfffftt could ve fooled me upon fixing this issue he runs back out to his truck and takes off and after getting a complaint from the watchers of two of the other tv s i call him back again and he came back in and fixed them also forgot to add the third time he came in he blundered through my house knocking things down including a onceexpensive camcorder but being the nice person i am im going to overlook it he also said the new cisco explorer hdc lrb that cox is giving everybody rrb he said there is a wellknown widescale issue with the recording and playback and that there should be a fix within a week sounds great cox giving out a box that they know is broken once again i am very displeased with their service customer service and technicians and i would most certainly not recommend cox to anyone
i ordered the gyro combo with fries gyro had a wierd taste to it that it almost tasting like clorox for some reason i dont know if the smell got into what the cook was making or if it was close to the grill whatever it was i did nt finish it and i m a big guy the fries are frozen no effort to even buy real potatoes peel and deep fry they were underdone as well for i guess i should not complain to much but that place but another place down the street for is fantastic and will always choose the other place at least i tried it for you so you do nt have to i m sure it s a family place and they are really nice as other reviewers have stated but this place will not last if they can get a gyro out in minutes flat with fries more effort is needed for fresh ingredients and fresh cut fries
this review is not for the shooting range but for the instructor rick barkett who conducted our ccw course a few months back the entire class of about people were in agreement when i say that this guy is a major fucking asshole he was clearly disgusted that so many people many of whom were nt very knowledgeable about firearms could be attending a class for a concealed carry permit now i would agree that some of them should know more about their pistols  revolvers before they try to carry them around in their back pockets but since we live in a country where we still have the right to bear arms and they were attending a class to follow legal protocol i d say that this guy should just shut the fuck up and teach his class without passing so much judgment on the students if nobody asked a question he had a smart ass remark about that if somebody asked a question he had an equally smart ass remark during the shooting portion of the training he was totally condescending towards everybody although he did shut the fuck up with me when he saw all of my bullseye shots there was one guy who actually wanted to slash his tires after the course but reconsidered because of all the surveillance cameras at the joint that would have been funny if i ever see his name again for a training class i ll be sure to skip it and attend elsewhere
this place is misleading in what type of facility is when you pull up there are listings on the sign mendy s place and children s emergency center oh they offer types of care options mendy s place for normal issues and children s emergency for emergencies the listings point to same place so ok they must be housed in same area wrong but you do nt know this until after your child is seen and they tell you the copay for an er visit they quote emtala as the reason for not telling you cost of servicesco pay upon entry even tho its clear your child is not suffering from an emergency situation oh and the receipt and paperwork you receive also does not reference an emergency facility but it is has been for years but if one s not been here before how would one know  the signs are misleading they hide behind emtala so they can see you and thus process larger claim if you re looking for an urgent type facility this is not it
the folks working at this place have that inner city charm except when they act like they were pulled off the streets unbathed and ready to make your sandwich you have to fight for the flea s attention span of the guy who s taking your order over his shouts to his friends outside the television and the other people working with him the cheesesteak was nt that bad although my cold fries were covered with lukewarm cheez wiz nasty this place is nothing like the location in phoenix it s like the diry little brother of the phoenix location thumbs down
went to frank  lupe s tonight went early to take advantage of happy hour of  off margs and apps i m sure i saw these same appetizers lrb mini tacos rrb at costco i think the guacamole dip was in the next refrigerated door at costco the place was empty on a friday happy hour evening i also asked for hotter salsa than what is offered with their chips and they put a commercial bottle of hot sauce on the table and not even the good stuff really  do they know how absolutely easy and quickly it is to make homemade salsa  mild medium hot  then the dinners came i ordered the stuffed pork sopaipillas and my companion ordered the cream chicken enchaladas the pork was in big chuncks that were sadly hard tasteless and disappointing i had to use a knife to cut into something that should have been falling apart when you touched it with your fork my companion usually cleans his plate and eats half of mine he ate maybe a  of his dish and would not eat the chunk of pork i gave him from my dish both dinners seemed like microwaved specials we also fought off the constant presence of flies through our entire time there when our waiter asked us if we needed anything else i let him know how bad the food was and told him about the fly situatiuon he addressed none of this and another waiter came over to give us our bill i could have told him that i found a rusty buick in my dinner and he would have not acknowledged my complaint or have done anything about it this used to be a special place but it is well below par in my opinion and that is a shame i hope they make an effort and take the steps to do better
after renting a car for per day for days  our actual bill ended up being lrb after adding taxes gps and a ton of taxes rrb as if this was nt a joke the fact that the gps auto locked requiring a pin number when we were in a precarious place where the gps was the most critical only made it worse because of our need to call the call center times to figure it out lrb pins kept not working rrb we were hours late in returning the car as a result the bill was increased by more when we went to talk to the manager to discuss the associate  was extremely informal  and after we stated we wanted to pay no more than what we initially agreed to pay  he called his supervisor and said we were nt buying his explanation and we wanted to pay the original amount unprofessional and a mess plus the taxes from the city are outrageous making it not worth renting a car at all based on other reviews my challenges are not rare seems like avis needs to work a little harder
how is this place in business  the only thing good i can say about it is it was soo bad it made us leave and we found an amazing place no names mentioned but you can read my reviews service was nonexistant and the place was not well kept at all we left after one short drink too much wrong to list just skip this one
i ve heard fantastic things about this place that it is a cozy and the sandwiches and salads are perfect for a ladies lunching type of afternoon my girlfriend and i decided to give it a whirl today and i wish i could have my back yes for lunch which was salad sandwich and diet cokes rip off we had the hob nob cob salad which was gross it was seriously a salad you could make better at home  spring lettuce a tiny sliver of avocado and some turkey meat and sprinkle of bacon drenched in ranch dressing i really should have taken it back because the amount of dressing made it unedible i could have rungout my salad then we split the vito sandwich lrb the italian one rrb  again it was falling apart and the lid on the balsamic jar must have fallen off as they were putting the dressing on our sandwich because it was soggy and dripping zero presentation the only good thing about this place is the ambience
this place is terrible the people who work there are rude and unattentive i am a marathon runner and have started using a brand of fuel that is sold at very few places and they have the best selection against every fiber of my being i had to give this place some additional business despite my terrible experiences purchasing accessories prior my mistake i rolled up to the shop after a long strenuous hill run and was in desperate need for some recovery fuel lrb within that critical minutes rrb low and behold i had just missed them since they closed at pm but one of the guys was there running a spin class outside and let me in  pretty nice i thought i popped in grabbed what i needed and headed up to the counter i apologized to the guy working in there saying i recognized they were closed and i really appreciated it not only do i get zero response but i get zero acknowledgment no eye contact no hi i ll be right with you not even a lady wait your turn nothing like i did nt exist so i patiently stood at the counter with my packets while the employee poked around the repair area avoiding me waiting for the customers ahead of me to shop around i could see there was zero chance he was going to talk to me much less ring me up while he waited for them to look at shirts shoes saddles you name it after minutes lrb no joke minutes rrb of standing around completely unacknowledged i threw the packets on the counter and walked out the spin class guy outside watched me leave empty handed who knows if he did the math on the lost sale because not only will i never purchase fuel from them again i will go elsewhere when i decide to buy a road bike i now order all of my fuel online so much for patronizing a local business
my friend and i were down in phoenix for a poetry show that night which ended about pm we had nt eaten anything since lunch and were on our way to the hotel we were staying at for the night just around the corner from this location we wanted to eat prior to checking in  so we stopped in about pm to grab dinner the restaurant was almost vacant there were maybe other people eating in the space and a rowdy group of about people at the bar the guests  or so we thought  at the bar were quite a distraction  yelling screaming and carrying on we know the restaurant must be closing soon so we quickly put in our orders  falafel pitas with greek fries  one of their specialties we quickly discovered that the rowdy bar crowd we were seated right in front of was not locals or a big group of friends watching the game but were offduty employees of the restaurant who were clearly intoxicated this could be deduced from them knowing all the staff that was working and who kept going back to the bar to hang out our food came out fairly quickly and looked and tasted alright right after we started eating an older blonde woman in all black came up to our table and stuck her face less than inches from our plates and began to examine our food she did nt touch it  just stared at it perplexed and then asked what did you order   we told her falafel pitas and greek fries she scowled and exclaimed that s a lot of cholesterol she then went to the table next to ours  who still had people eating at it  and asked if she could get them anything else  because she was a waitress i might add that our waitress was fairly polite and generally just looked like she did nt really want to be there while waiting for our bill  because at this point we really just wanted to leave and go to our hotel  the phone rang  the hostess told one of the bar crowd members that she had a call she ran to the hostess station to take it  immediately started using loud profanities and talking about how she did nt want to go to her babies daddy s house tonight this went on for several minutes at one point the manager came out and asked her to quiet down  she was nearly shouting  but did nt ask her to take the call elsewhere needless to say we paid quickly and ran out the door later that night we were both up vomiting  more than likely from food poisoning i will never go back to this restaurant ever again terrible experience
i really do nt like this terminal i use it often as a layover on the way from san francisco to minneapolis it s too hot and the domestic gates are too far which makes you always have to walk a mile to switch gates not even comparable to other major hubs like denver minneapolis atlanta etc
lets make this simple  if you can mess up a simple banana milk shake lrb something even i he who burns water can make rrb you deserve no stars and since yelp is kind enough to you and wont let me do that let me give you whats next your saving grace the lady at the counter was sweet and tried to do her best
this was the most horrible experience i have ever had in any establishment retail or otherwise i will never ever ever ever go there again not only was the owner horribly rude she was also a horrible cheat she was hired to do a few repairs and gave me a quote when i went to pick up the work lrb they never called me to tell me that anything was finished rrb she tells me that the most expensive piece could not be done then gives me the same amount due for the other pieces i confront her and she refuses to not scam me she covered the original receipt lrb i lost mine rrb and refuses to let me see it they are horrible horrible lying cheats and i urge no one to use their business
gross their tortilla soup tasted like vomit after two spoons full i proceeded to throw up in the bathroom never eating there again
we decided to hit up the wine down wednesday that was happenin at tastings courtesy of kyot here s what went wrong the event is from  so we arrived just a few minutes lrb maybe  rrb after so we could get a spot just in case it was hoppin we walked in and the hostess lrb she looks like she s possibly the manager or owner rrb asked if we were there for the event and then pointed us towards the back room where the event was being held we walked in and there were about tables and there were people at them all already talk about early bird gets the worm we had to wait for about  minutes for the waitress to finish with a table to find out if we could sit on the patio for the event she said yes and that she would be right out to help us in the meantime another woman and her friend also took up at a patio table nearby minutes later the hostessownermanager looking woman came out and asked if we had been helped yet we said no and she left only to return with a small happy hour flier menu which she just handed from a distance and did nt even come over to our table i know you re wondering why i would wait the minutes but i really wanted to see just how bad the service was going to be and frankly i just wanted some good wine it s been about minutes and the same woman comes back with full detailed menus and i asked if the happy hour flier was the deals for the event and she said yes and then asked if we were ready to order um you just gave us the menus seconds ago by now i m ready to just order and enjoy the meal deals from the event i look over the happy hour flier and i see some app deals they said there was a specialty appetizer menu not so much but whatever i can deal with that then i see the drink section the claim for the event was glasses of wine i was excited to try some nice new wines on the cheap but again not so much in reality it was glasses of house wine which only consisted of three different wines that were nt really what i was looking for by now the other women that were outside decided to leave having had enough of this shenanigans we decided lrb after minutes since we arrived rrb to go next door to sprouts get some apps and have our own wine down wednesday at home i bet there are plenty of people that will have good experiences here and continue to visit happily but this one experience has caused me to write them off for good lrb which i do nt usually do after one instance rrb i wish that i could actually review their wine and food but the service was so poor and substandard that it s not worth giving them my money i understand if the food is nt good at a restaurant  some are just better or more talented than others however any business can and should have good customer service i think this is where the cliched line of if i could give them less than star i would comes in oh yeah and i slapped down a you ve been yelped card as i left take that tastings
i like to describe this place as the italian version of pei wei only not as tasty i have been times now and never have i been like i m glad i ate that i heard from a ton of ppl that their mac and cheese was so good well despite that it was cold and the noodles were undercooked slightly crunchy when i got it it might have been decent bc the cheese sauce was flavorful i first went here with my old roommate when we had an intense craving for spaghetti with meatballs you would think a place called sauce would serve that but nope the pizza was soso but not worth the price and forget about that lame little roll they give you ya i d rather not hop over to olive and ivy next door and spend a few extra bucks on their pizza which is by far better
pretty bad i ordered broccoli noodles for take out which is pad see euw with your choice of meat i chose tofu and shrimp got back to my hotel room and realized i had broccoli tofu and shrimp basically in soy sauce with rice no noodles and bleh sauce
i got a pedicure here recently and will never go back again it only lasted a few days and it was painful after one day the polish started to discolor and within days it started peeling off in huge flakes i went in to tell them how unhappy i was and they said they can not make any guarantees and would not redo my nails for free i will not go back there again poor pedicure and very rude service
what a waste of timemoney the menu pictures of the food look delicious but what i got was completely different i wanted it to be tasty but i got some slapped together shrimp tacos with white rice  white rice and butter crunchy bleh i was expecting lots of shrimp for the expensive plate i bought i got tiny little shrimpies do nt deprive me of my shrimp i love shrimp anyway so bland no flavor so little food i am not one to eat a lot i just was expecting a bigger portion for what i paid for i feel like a jerk every time i rate a place low but the thing is when i dislike something the first thing that comes to my head is i gotta tell other yelp about my terrible experience
the high point of our meal was the cold mug that our beer came in worst food worst service and just plain ick not that clean here either the service was slow and inefficient with messed up orders and confusion the food was tasteless though hot with so many choices out there take my advice and skip this place your stomach will thank you later when you are not suffering like i did one star for the ice cold beer
i am as i write this having my wifes vehicles tire replaced it is the last tire that they will ever replace or repair for me if i can help it earlier this year i had sets of tires installed on two of my vehicles calls were never returned as promised both before and after i was going to have a third vehicle serviced but again they did not bother to call me so i went to walm art and they went under for the exact same set of tires and had the tires in stock as they said they would two days ago i had an employee tell me i was flat wrong about prices i got from walmart eirlier that day he then called them and asked about tires on the phone but when he misspoke and i tried to ask the walmart employee a question he muted the phone and told me i was not allowed to speak i turned ariound and walked out nobody followed me to apologize or anything so i went across the street and got the tire at walmart that i was promised at the price promised the worst part about buying sets of tires form discount is that after being a year customer and never having to worry about anything with discount they cheated me it s as much my fault as it is theirs though iassumed when i told them to give me full warranties lrb like i always do rrb i did not realize that they did nt but this morning when the tire started comming apart on it s own my wife was told she has no warranty lrb on a tire that is separating  rrb are you kidding  discount you got me i hope it was worth it because i will never use youe again and i will tell anyone who will listen not to darken your doors jim french new river az
bad quality ingredients i ordered a red curry beef and the beef was awful hard i tried to chew it for a minute and decided to give up
so i ve been going to this place for years not bc the food blows my mind but rather it hits the spot plus i love sitting on the patio drinking wine when the weather is nice with my best gal anyhow my other best gal my mom had never tried this spot i thought duck would be great for a quick casual lunch she s a vegetarian so we ordered the where s the beef sandwich to share it took about minutes to make the sandwich which feels like an eternity when your hungry when i glanced at the sandwich i thought perhaps they had added some portobello mushrooms to it turns out the dark brown layer was actually rotten avocado really  i mean come on avocado is like prime rib to vegetarians how can you f this up  it was truly nasty it got me to thinking if someone actually put this into the sandwich what else would their low standards allow them to place into an unsuspecting victims sammie it s not like they make them with blindfolds on i was really grossed out when i brought it to the manager s attention she did nt seem that bothered by it they remade half a sandwich for me and that was that it was annoying bc i left feeling that duck  decanter takes for granted the fact that loyal customers will stick with them no matter what well not this one plus that place needs a serious dusting yuck
the human race has jumped the shark
my wife and i were only in phoenix for a night and figured we would try some mexican food seeing as we had never been in the southwest before our st restaurant down the street never got around to serving us so we came to rosalita  s figuring it might have authentic mexican cuisine it was brutal the service was atrocious as one poor guy was working both the bar and the lounge area which had about tables full he was pleasant but completely overwhelmed the food itself tasted as if it had been left out all day and simply reheated the chips were stale and the salsa tasted suspiciously like the crappy ortega stuff you buy in the supermarket my shrimp dish was so disastrous that i only ate half of it because i was afraid it might make me sick the shrimp were overcooked to the point of turning into rubber and the sauce was nauseating the rice was overcooked and dry and the green salad of lettuce and carrots was steamed this was without a doubt the worst mexican i have ever eaten in my life my wife thought her tacos were bland but much more edible than my shrimp even though the cheese was not authentic or tasty at all
do nt do it do nt even think about moving here it s not safe it s not nice to look at parking sucks and the management is awful our laundry room flooded on several occasions and getting maintenance to come by was an absolute struggle the water was turned off at amam on different occasions without warning so when it was time for us to be up and showering for work we could nt even brush our teeth my car got towed in regular uncovered parking for having the tags two weeks expired one week from moving out a guy got pistol whipped by the dumpsters where everyone has to park i m pretty sure i ve made my point so i ll stop before a vein pops out of my head from having to think about this hellhole
i was not greeted until i was about to leave out of the store the lady lrb said she was the owner rrb at the register clearly saw me as i was looking at some tanks right by the register she said nothing until i was about to head out that s when she wanted to ask if i was looking for anything in particular i actually was nt i just wanted to see what they had to offer being that it was my first time in the boutique i asked if she was the owner and she proudly stated that she is and that she has another location as well even if i would have received good customer service this definitely is nt a store that i d be out on the prowl for the items seem a tad bit chintzy and out dated
we went to down under wines and bistro with anticipation for wine tasting and some good food i was new to down under and anxious to see what the fuss was all about it was a busy bustling funlooking wine restaurant with the aussie flare i anticipated yet i was not prepared for the lack of service lack of attentiveness confused staff and negligence i will say the wines were tasty and well worth drinking lrb yet they did not make the wines so i give them little credit for this rrb we ordered our two allotted appetizers the potstickers encouraged us as they were very tasty with just a touch of spice and tangy sauce not a fewd gasm moment but worth tasting again loving bruschetta we decided to brave the combo of four wild mushroom  goat cheese with hint of citrus this was unattractive bland soggy mushrooms with some slimy white substance that did nt resemble any goat cheese i know of artichoke hearts with lemon  parmesan cheese canned artichokes hint of teeny lemon and again unrecognizable bland white sauce smoked salmon lrb smoke was non  existent rrb mascarpone lrb decent not remarkable rrb the salmon was said to have the chef s special sauce it was so special we could nt find it nor taste it loving fig with prosciutto and brie i thought surely this one is going to rock the fig was a cheaters version that tasted like a sad fig jam we had barely a tiny piece of prosciutto the cheese they called brie  i ve no idea what it was  and it was again runny and bland this was disappointing along with the fact i filled mine and my companion s water glass all night there was a mixed drink shaker edging its way toward us with a white liquid oozing out that we had to point out lrb several servers went past it all evening rrb it was not appetizing nor acceptable our bartender would laugh these comments off the water pitchers were filled right in front of us and yet not one server noticed our glasses we had been rather hungry but after very poor service and disappointingly bland food we decided our leftover lamb shoulders at home surely would be better than what this attractive initially intriguing bistro had to offer we knew the service would be better i think it has potential and flare service can make or break a dining experience perhaps they need more servers or more training in the end the bartender tried to make up a bit by offering a taste of a big red that was from lodi winery resembling a lovely truchard it was pleasant but sadly did not leave us with a desire to return giving one star was being generous we were almost served the wrong thing several times the staff seemed very confused they were attentive to their regulars customer service means you treat a person so they cant wait to come back there are many more tasty intriguing restaurants of the valley i would rather feed my hunger and my soul
i was here with friends for drinks and dinner last thursday evening and i have to say that nothing about this restaurant was acceptable for any of us first we did nt have reservations and were greeted with slightly rude service by the host however i think she noticed that we were a little taken aback by the attitude and quickly changed her mood in the downstairs bar we ordered drinks while we waited for a table to open up for us the bartender made a mistake while preparing my friend s bloody mary accidentally dumping an enormous amount of tabasco in her drink however instead of simply making a new one he served it to her anyway lrb admitting his mistake while setting it down in front of her rrb and told her to let him know if she did nt like it and wanted a new one of course she tried it could nt drink it and had to ask for a new one after we got to our table upstairs and ordered our appetizers and meals things got worse it took well over half an hour to get our appetizers and when we did they were cold we were not sure that our oysters were supposed to be as cold as they were but the fact that they had congealed melted cheese seemed to indicate that they should haver at least been warm after we finally got our salads lrb about minutes after ordering rrb we were rushed through them before getting our meals just a couple minutes later none of us enjoyed our meals as we found them either burnt or bland even though we made a few complaints about our meal to the server when our check came we found that we had been charged for everything and were only offered a very pallid apology for the obvious problems with our meal this was not an inexpensive meal either so we will likely not be back
i had purchased the groupon for the phoenix location as a treat for my birthday trip to arizona i had heard great things about the experience so i was very much looking forward to treating myself however when i called to make an appointment the call center staff was rude and impatient once i informed them i had a groupon they told me i was unable to use it during the one day i had available in town when i asked if it was possible to make any sort of arrangement she cut me off and told me no and that if she even tried she would get in trouble she then asked me if i wanted to book the appointment and pay for it without the groupon  i understand her wanting to try to make the sale but i felt it somewhat inappropriate to ask someone who has already paid for a voucher lrb rrb to make an appointment with a payment of another plus tip needless to say the guest service is severely lacking and i do nt know that i d be willing to give drybar another chance
this has always been a favorite of ours for dinner before an event at gammage so this is nt the first time we have been here but it will be the last seriously while i have never been overly impressed with house of tricks my girlfriend has and the atmosphere is pretty nice for me the food has always been just ok not bad but not anything special in this city of really good restaurants the service in the past has always been pretty good but saturday night was a whole different story from the bottom to the top we had reservations for for a show at gammage plenty of time right  well it was nt we showed up and were seated about crowded  not really we spied about a half dozen empty tables there was a line at the hostess station and it was obvious it was a first night of work for someone or maybe a couple of their first nights it took almost minutes for them to seat parties even though there were a lot of empty tables so about minutes later a young woman approached us and said she was not our server but that she would bring us some water she asked if we were going to gammage and we said yes the server would be told this we were assured about we ordered a bottle of wine when our water arrived it showed up about upon opening the wine a server knocked my glass of water into my lap really not that big of a deal at the time as i was wearing black pants and accidents happen our actual server finally showed up and we told her we were now in a bit of a hurry since it was now about no problem we ordered three caesar salads and a bowl of soup and our entrees by the time the salads arrived at we knew we might be in trouble on time but the server told us that the kitchen knew that we needed to leave soon for the play soon rolled around and we knew there was no way for us to stay and eat when we informed the server she said our meals still were nt ready anyway she kept blaming the kitchen the manager lrb  rrb apologized and said he would comp the salads and cup of soup big of him the wine was a bottle of wine they paid for he should have comped it too really we were nt looking for anything free here but he made sure that we were nt ever coming back and he could have prevented that by making a gesture for the water in my lap and the overall bad service not only have they lost our patronage but we brought friends along from out of town who come into town for events at gammage and their feelings were the same to be honest there are just way too many good restaurants in town to be treated this way and just to be told they were sorry this place has a great atmosphere and decent food that s not enough anymore in this day and age someone mentioned in another review that house of tricks seems to be having some issues with service around this timeframe it is unfortunate that it happens to anyone but for us its unacceptable
whenever we ve gone there there s rarely anyone to help you the lady at the cutting table always seems overwhelmed too the checkout line is long and atrocious last night we went in so i could look for a pattern to make my son a christmas jacket out of velvet none of their books had patterns for special occasions for boys and of course there was no one to be found except a lady vacuuming who did nt look like she wanted to talk to anyone lrb or maybe she did nt speak english and that s why she did nt make eye contact rrb
this place is just plain rank we were seated late  the food came cold and late and the time between the first plate and the last plate brought to our table was over mins i do not care if they comped the appetizers or the last entree the place is a joke and some loser in the bathroom asked me hurry up while i was peeing in the urinal it almost got violent not only is the restaurant a loser the customers are also
came in with my dad during one sweltering august night lured in by the cute s ambience and by the nostalgia of going to the sugar bowl as a kid the people who worked there were simply rude barely acknowledging our presence when we ordered i saw that he scooped out of a container that said dreyer s if a sundae could be bland this was i know a lot of places used massproduced ice cream but i would go to sweet republic in a heartbeat over this place
this review is for a wallet zipper replacement after seeing so many positive reviews i headed over during my lunch hour the owner took a personal phone call and continued on the call the entire time i was there i briefly asked if he could replace the zipper he charged me during his conversation on the phone and told me to pick it up the next day fast forward to the next day there was a sign on the door that said closed and then go next door so i walked in to a barber shop the woman nearest the door interrupted a haircut and headed over with me i handed her my ticket she looked at it briefly and asked me for a description of the item she proceeded to dig through the back room came out holding a wallet nope that happened again then she called me back and asked me which of the purses and wallets on display was mine none of them then she noticed my wallet was in a huge pile of other items on the repair table still unrepaired awesome the next day i arrived to pick up my item it had been hurredly put together with a zipper that was inappropriate for the weight of the wallet was very hard to zipunzip there were plenty of gaps where it was nt sewn correctly and was nt the same color as the original brown zipper i explained the problems told him i would be happy to take it somewhere else if he would like to refund my money but he insisted he redo it i decided to give him a few days before heading back and they had someone new manning the front desk there are still gaps where the zipper is nt fully sewn to the edge of the wallet an added bonus of several layers of knotted upholstery thread on the wallet edge and a black zipper aesthetics aside from a purely utilitarian standpoint it fulfills its purpose
fyi this place is membership only as i was so rudely told upon entering the store i have driven past this store numerous times and today my husband and i attempted to check it out we walked in and behind me i hear the yells of hey hey i turn around and the girl at the counter asks do you have a membership  no i did nt know i needed one i replied this store is not open to the public ok  sorry the better thing to say would have been to ask if i would like to open a membership and not be so rude and turn away business here s a store i will not be giving my business to
awful they do nt accept coupons or honor adverted rates on their own building pushy to sell you things you do nt need by describing the horrific fantastical situations you will encounter if you drive off their lot without purchasing their repairs lrb and i only went in for an oil change on a haha rrb oh and you ll need a long shower and a tetanus shot after visiting their waiting room yuck
what are the meatballs made of  my husband and i decided it is mostly bread we were disappointed in the food and very disappointed in the price
staff is horrible i went not to get pain meds lrb most of the patients looked like tweakers rrb but to see if i needed an mri i arrived an hour early bc i hate being lost and late i was called maybe min after my appointment time and they took minutes to call me up to get a simple script for bloodwork if i had nt went up they would have never called me or called me an hr later the lady i was sitting next to said they usually never call the people up they have to ask them for the scripts bc they are too busy chatting amongst themselves i also left my military id there and they did nt even have the common courtesy to call me and tell me i left it behind when i called days later to see if they had it lrb they did rrb i asked if they could mail it since i live an hour away they acted as if i asked for crack cocaine and told me they could nt mail it to me after speaking to a higher up they said they could mail it but could nt tell me when i guess it was just too inconvenient and burdensome for them the place is also dirty and wreaks of bo also make sure you sign in on a seperate sheet of paper for parking they were too lazy to tell me this and i almost had to pay the measley bucks for parking until the parking attendant decided to let me off the hook
they wanted to charge me to pick a lock  eventually they went down to after letting them know there was no way i would pay that they said the service charge is still  after it looked like i was going to just pay the they came up with a  discount  it took them minutes to open the lock  the price should be around tops  these guys come across so greedy that they do nt think about how word of mouth can make a small company or break it
what the pho man  the food is bland it tastes like they cater to the elderly the prices are high for the type of food you are getting nobody should have to bay over for any type of pho i ve gone there x and i do nt know if it s just me but the hostess there just rubbed me the wrong way both times she was cracking jokes and making comments that were borderline inappropriate they focus more on decor and trying to entertain their patrons rather than focusing on what s really important the food you want a really good authentic bowl of pho  go to saigon pho on alma schoolknox it s not as ritzy and refined but the pho and other menu items there are less expensive tastes better and they serve you much larger portions eat at cyclo if you want to have a seemingly overattentive hostess bothering you while you try to eat lrb i say seemingly because while you may think she s overattentive in reality she has nt even done as much as refill your water glass rrb
firstly having visited several acura dealerships around the nation acura of tempe is by far the worst acura operation avoid at all costs the following is an explanation to why they can not be trusted i visited the service department for both an oil change and warranty service i was then told that the warranty service request would need to be reviewed by the manager lrb despite the fact that  over the telephone  i was told that the repair could be made rrb my service advisor told me that a loaner car would be available for the duration that my car would be in service and warranty repair i waited several lrb about rrb minutes for the service manager to appear seemingly unapologetic for the rather long delay the manager reviewed my warranty repair request the manager then stated that i would need to pay for a loaner car he then said that my warranty request would need to be reviewed by a certified specialist after feeling distrust for acura of tempe s operation i immediately departed that is when i discovered that acura of north scottsdale is by far the best acura dealership in the valley acura of north scottsdale performed all warranty and service work lrb the latter of which was at a lesser price than acura of tempe rrb moreover i was issued a loaner car at not cost lrb again unlike acura of tempe rrb
i just threw up a little hearing the name jack in the box hope you are ready for some food poisoning
we had a really bad experience the day after christmas we received a gift card and we were hoping to use it for brunch when we arrived every table that was not occupied was dirty lrb literately rrb so we sat at the counter after waiting mins we informed the manager still after more minutes of waiting no one came to take our order we eventually gave up and walked out the manager meekly uttered a sorry as we left
i had eaten at this garcia s a numerous amount of times with family friends co workers etc i wont be going back to this location after my last experience i visited this location a few weeks ago with some friends and my intermediate family which consists of myself my fiance and my month old daughter we went around pm so the lunch rush was gone after being told we couldnt be sat in a table we were seated in a half table half booth there were of us and the booth had a curve to it between my daughter in her stroller and our guests son s booster seat we were very uncomfortable needless to say i personally asked our waitress for a chair to sit on the opposite side of everyone so that we were not so crammed she got me a chair and i finished my lunch about minutes before i was getting ready to leave a different waiter tapped me on the shoulder and said um you are definitely in the way i was beyond mortified that an employee would ever treat a customer like that my group alone spent there for lunch that is the worst customer service i have ever received i wont just not be returning i now wont be recommending
avoid avoid avoid what is this place japanese  italian  do they know who they are  we ordered seaweed salad  i think my frys has better salad for  my daughter ordered california rolls  very average  the pad thai was as bland as i have ever had and the calamari was over fried and zero flavor  no wonder they offer sauce kids liked the cinnamon flavored bread so that accounts for one star
worst event i have ever been to totally beats the oktoberfest in tempe the lines are atrocious the drink booth is pretty much invisible with warm beverages trucks were closed lrb who knows why rrb good thing i left before i had to attempt the bathroom line also we were there early and it sucked that much take the kids though probably fun for them as long as you brought food for them
what a joke my girlfriend and i were rather hungry and we had a gift card for olive garden so we went here not only was the  host rather short and seemed to hate his job we sat and waited for a server we sat there waiting and waiting as a waiter repeatedly walked passed us asked the table next to us if they wanted dessert proceeded to drop off their bill took their payment without ever even acknowledging us i guess our cue that we should have left before we were ignored for over minutes sitting at the table was the couple speaking with a manager as we walked in they didnt seem very happy we drove the extra miles to the e cactus location where we had awesome service and the food was enjoyable so all in all do nt be surprised if you have a bad experience at this olive garden
why for the love of god do people take small children to an adult movie and why oh why does the theater staff allow this to happen  howeeeeeever we are bluntly told we ca nt take in our cold stone waffle cone ice creams because of a new outside food and drink policy but these three small children can run and cry and scream throughout the entire movie i hate you people i paid for my entry ticket for a soda and popcorn and you ruined my hopes of escaping from reality for not even two hours parents who poorly plan and ruin movie nights for other moviegoers can suck it hard and amc you get caught up in the crossfire for turning a blind eye i m done with you and i want my money back
just say no to macayo you may want to drive out of glendale for food mexican food
coming from vancouver and after seeing it on triple d we were eager to try it but sadly they were closed lrb i do nt mean closed for the day but closed for good everything was vacant weird that the website still lists them maybe a good time to change that
awful drinks the beer was extremely watered down and the mixed drinks were horrible not a place for a group get togethers for lunch before a game
this h  m has a great selection of clothes i ve been to this location times now and every single time i go the customer service is hideous i went shortly having a baby and it was a sunday lrb about a month ago rrb i did nt realize that it was pm lrb closing time rrb and a sales associate asked me is there anything i can help you with in your last few minutes  i had already been there for about minutes i m not one of those shoppers who wants to hang out after closing hours i wanted to at least try on the pieces i chose because of being months postpartum i was nt sure what might fit rushing to the fitting room a guy stops me and says the fitting rooms are closed then the actual guy working the fitting rooms says well how many items do you have to try on  if you go fast i ll let you try them on are you kidding me  meanwhile there are two other ladies right behind me wanting to finish shopping and buy their pieces as well as i m purchasing my pieces the girl ringing me up does nt even bother to say hello or acknowledge me at all so i go again today and not one person acknowledges my husband and i while we re shopping which is okay because i do nt like being bothered while i m shopping anyway we get to the guy ringing us up and he says not one word to us the whole time i finally said wow you people here are really friendly at this h  m and he says that s what everyone says about us and that scottsdale is so rude i tell him that i was being sarcastic rather than apologizing he says ooooohhhh and so does his coworker next to him they can care less and i want nothing to do with this h  m ever again
disgusting we just decided to pull over and rest for the night after an exhausting long trek from mid texas our room smells of stale cigarettes and dog there are left over dirty towels in the bathroom from whomever stayed here before us there s what seems to be mold on the shower walls and now i m fearing for my life laying on this bed wondering when they cleaned it last i am so uncomfortable and disgusted i want to scream but i m too exhausted to go and complain besides i highly doubt they have anything better i m assuming if they let one hotel room look and smell this bad then why would they care about any other room bottom note staying at la quinta is like staying in a crack motel
i went here on the last stop of a pub crawl which had been pretty seemless before going to ra everything had been prearranged  they knew that our group was coming and offered to provide us with happy hour prices during our visit however when we got there the people working at the time had no idea we were coming had no where to sit our big group together and were nt offering any drinkfood specials and on top of all of that everyone from the hostess to the waitress had a stank attitude about it really  turned off by their lack of organization and the fact that they had attitudes we left  all of us  and took our business to ztejas where they were more than happy to accommodate us i ve been to ra s ahwatukee location several times and while ra s sushi in general is not stellar the service is at least good i wo nt be visiting this tempe location ever again
i really wanted to like this place  close to home simple menu of burgers and fries nice look i even gave it a second chance but no more the first time we went the service was tepid at best the food was okay the second time i went the counter guy had his back turned to the counter and kept talking on the phone even though we were waiting to order he was surly and went outside and spit eeewww again the food was okay but the counter guy left such a bad impression i was kind of grossed out eating it it s a shame because it looks like someone spent some bucks setting this place up too bad the owner seems to be mia  i ca nt see this place staying around too much longer
i came here a few days ago with the wife we had gone to them when they were in buckeye and it was awesome our experience this time was less than stellar the dough tasted like playdough salty as hell undercooked and kinda slimysludgy in the middle the toppings lrb wife had cinnamon and i had green chili chicken rrb and the mild salsa were the only reasons i could eat a few bites i ended up scraping it off and throwing out the fry bread the price was about avg but still not worth the taste i dont think we will try it again sad day
i was expecting this place to be a nice resort the place is kind of newly established because it was really hard to find this place in the evening there are no signs if you come from the back and there is a lot of construction going on although they make an effort for it to look nice my room was facing a trailer park and some desolate houses it seems like it s at the edge of town not to mention there was a sign on my hotel door that said to use the double bolted lock at night the bed was okay the sheets could and blanket could have been more luxurious good thing i got free internet because i was there on business they put me in the building furthest from the lobby so it took about minutes to walk there i did nt get a sense of it being safe if i walked there at night they had no express checkout so i tried checking out using their television that also did nt work and when i called the front desk about three times nobody picked up i just left anyways because i did nt want to be late for my flight the only good thing is that they give free bottled water in the room but before you get excited it s just crappy cheap water nothing nice oh and there is a starbucks if you d like to walk all the way to the lobby again i was dissapointed and frankly i would rather stay somewhere else next time
tried to visit district as part of the urban wine walk it was only moderately busy in the bar and several other tables were participating in the uww however after waiting at a table for over minutes watching a waiter walk by us three times and see another waiter bus tables next to us without even a hello my group decided it was time to move on to find better service and an establishment interested in our business
i ve passed this place dozens of times i saw a groupon for it and i bought it i ordered the ahi dish when it was brought out i noticed mango all over it i told the waitress i was highly allergic to mango i did nt want to send back the whole dish so i kept the ahi and asked her to bring me new greens she had the audacity to charge me for a salad we even bought a bottle of wine and had our two kids with us we did nt just order which was what the groupon was for the food sucked too do nt waste your money it seems others with a groupon experiences the same type of awful service hmmm maybe the managerowner should have told their wait staff to be a little more pleasant to grouponers calling all grouponers who had a bad experience please take the time and post your horrific experience
this place is just plain nasty i tried it once and it was so bad that i took a couple bites and threw it out fast forward a year or so  i was in the hood in a hurry for lunch and craving japanese but needed something quick so thought i would give it another try nope bad idea got it to go went back to the office took a bite and in the trash it went again i lived in japan for years and travel there frequently still i do nt expect this to be up to the standards of what i could get there but i ve had school cafeteria japanese food that certainly beat this
so i went to mcdonalds last wednesday the drive thru was pretty busy so i decided to go inside yeah it s dinner time and it seemed like the crew was more focused on the drive thru and could care less about guests  the register when we finally got our order taken we had to wait and wait and wait the crew was still focused on the drive thru and guests in the dining room still had to wait to have their order taken  food handed out when we got home the fries were cold and very salty blah so on saturday i figured i would try them again i was certain it was their dinner time rush from my last visit this time i was smart and went to the drive thru i ordered double cheese burgers no pickles and french fries the burgers still had pickles on them  the fries were cold and salty again the store may look nice and refreshed but i wo nt be loving it at this places
had a male manicurist who did not speak an ounce of english i went in for for a simple manicure it usually takes half an hour this place took hours and the work was absolutely horrible the coat was uneven you could see my nail through some spots also the male attendant gave me a hand massage that nearly crushed my fingers i asked him to do it less firmly but he didnt understand me my skin turned blotchy red i would not recommend this place ever go somewhere where they understand english im sure service would have been better if they did not purposely put an inexperienced person to do my manicure they were not even busy when i went in but since i did not want the expensive pedicure as well they just pawned me off to the least experienced i was so upset about how long it took and the botched job that i paid without tip i will never go in there again and i very much recommend you never do as well
this is vietnamese food for north scottsdale white folks who have never had vietnamese food before it s a fast food style place that gives you food with very little flavor and tells you to start adding sriracha and oyster sauce util it starts to taste good really really bad
the wings are ok the server made some off comments to others in our party i will never go back after the lame apology from the manager
worst burritos i ve ever had not only was the service slow but the burrito had small ingredients mixed in that were nt even supposed to be there i got a california burrito asked for guacamole which they did not include and tucked into the fold of the awful tortilla was fried egg what the hell are these people doing  the whole thing was a runny mess of beans and almost no other ingredients the cashier was extremely rude the meat was subpar and i m pretty sure the chips were radioactive all in all i would nt recommend this place to anyone and if you re saying this is the best mexican place you clearly have nt been anywhere other than del taco or some other crap fast food chain
shocked with the customer service i m in from out of town and my friends took me to this place they told the employee working that they had screwed up their order twice before lrb forgot an order of cheese rrb the employee said she would comp an order of cheese lrb we ordered with our fries rrb then we get to the car and realize she left the cheese out we go back and she says she was sorry but could nt comp us the cheese why did nt she tell us this before we left  how deceitful we asked for the manager who huddled in the background during all this he finally came up and said he would take care of it hope the owners of this place hire new people with customer service skills  my friends are looking to find some other location to give their business to
the room was expensive especially considering the summer rates the waterpark experience was disappointing we could nt bring in juice for our kids only water bottles when my wife and i decided to get a cocktail it was for two and there was no trace of any alcohol i asked the bartender if i got a non alcoholic drink by mistake it s all regulated so you get oz in a tall drink for a drink i felt taken advantage the closing time on saturday is pm they tell you that you have full access to the waterpark on check in day but check in time is pm how does that work  for the cost of the room and drink service we should have stayed at a star resort we have stayed here before and had a better experience this will be the last time for this resort the hilton squaw peak is a much better option
i really do nt understand why all the great reviews about this place maybe it s because of it s location lrb being one of the few restaurants in litchfield park rrb or maybe it s the alcohol either way it s not that good being new to arizona we decided that on our anniversary we would try new restaurants the old pueblo cafe was our dinner choice poor choice to end a great day on this note we had a trio of tacos lrb beef chicken  fish rrb and a green chile beef chimichanga the chimi was mediocre the tacos were all bad the fish taco actually made us sick all were hard from being old tortillias absolutely this has been the second worst mexican food we have ever eaten also the food is really overpriced for the quality and quantity we wo nt be back and recommend that you do nt waste your time money or calories either
first you must understand that abf is not a full service moving company abf is a freight company that provides a freight trailer and ships your items packing loading and unloading services are contracted out to local moving firms all of which is coordinated by a company named movebuilder one moving company will pack and load your items at your current home then the items are transported to your new address where the unloading is performed by an entirely different moving company this makes it very difficult to keep your items organized other moving companies maintain the same crew from start to finish which goes much smoother the major problem i had was with the estimate a telephone interview is performed to generate an estimate i provided all the details requested and received an estimate of for everything lrb full packing loading transport unloading rrb at the time of loading the moving crew discovered that the trailer provided was not large enough to hold all of our items the representatives at movebuilder stated i would need an additional feet of space in one of their other trailers at a cost of  a  increase in price over the estimate i spoke at length with them about this and they offered no other options lrb eg split the cost subsidize a uhaul etc rrb when i asked about the gross inaccuracy of their estimate they stated that their estimates are usually very close and had no explanation for what happened in our case i would recommend avoiding this company unless you have a relatively small amount of stuff that you can easily pack  load yourself into a pod go with a traditional moving company if you need to pack  move a household

last time i go to this dunkin dounuts this is what i get going to a dunkin donuts in queen creek order was totally wrong i asked the lady to repeat my order there at the window they ran out of the croissant bread no problem then put it on a regular bread while waiting at window asked if my hot chocolate is the mint one she said no its the regular one told her i requested mint then i got my order and drove off once i got here at work they gave me the wrong sandwich i called the place and gave them heads up not pleased about this so basically i paid for a hot chocolate gave the sandwich to someone else ugh what gets me is that the person on the phone was oh well well let the people know to pay attention next time
my family and i ate lunch here for the first and last time the beans were greasy and the enchiladas were like soup the burros were alright but i ve had much better i hope that the ac was broken and that it s not always that hot inside the service was pretty bad to really slow i m giving them one star because the rice was good i d say find someplace else to eat
tried this place april th service was great portions not like typical sushi restrurants rice in sushi was very dry fish not fresh service good woke up the following morning with food poisioning i ordered a rainbow roll and seaweed salad thinking it was the rainbow roll that caused my illness it was all i ate all day avoid this place for sushi definately not fresh
this full service car wash is located on the ne corner of dysart and mcdowell you ca nt miss the giant car wash banners for a cheap exterior car wash why the onestar  i ve been here twice and that s it for me are the car amigos who pull your car up to the wash on some sort of commission or something  they will cut you off as you pull up to the wash from the vacuum area like you are fighting for who s next at a split drivethru line at mcdonald s what the hell is that about  the time i came here for an exterior wash lrb meaning you stay in your car while it goes thru the wash and drive away with a wet car rrb had to deal with aggressive car amigos cutting me off in line the first time i came here for a fullwash i sat there watching as the worker aggressively cut off another in my car they do nt spray scent in your car here you are given a choice of a scent pellet at the register and wait another  minutes for them to dry your car which was nt even that great of a job for the lrb ripoff rrb vip maybe i ll find a decent full service car wash someday in the meantime i ll just continue to use the selfservice car wash across the street at the circle k it s quick and actually costs less than the exterior wash at the full crappy autowash
run dont walk waste of time i started with a nice enough saleman  ron k however the day i was going to purchase a car the manager told me it would be at least a hour wait before i could meet with finace and this was after already waiting for a half an hour the next day i was left a vm from brad in finance requesting that i call him right away to discuss some great financing he found when i called him back he had me on speaker phone and harshly refused to give me any info over the phone he harshly stated it was against the law to release info to me over the phone because he couldnt confirm my identity when i pushed it and offered to provide pertinent info such as birthdate he then took me off speaker and stated he would call me later cause he had someone in the office he never called me back that night i went back and again was told again i would have to wait when i then attempted to leave the salesman  ron k tracked us down in the parking lot and stated that finace was ready for us as we walked into brads office it was quite obvious he was not ready nor did he care if we bought a vehicle or not brad proceeded to tell us that it is not customary for a salesman to walk clients into his office as i turned to walk out brad began cussing out the salesman he yelled you never fu walk customers into my office i then called one of the owners  frank who quite frankly seemed to care less and just made excuses for his finance guys poor behavior in fact he actually tried to blame the whole thing on the salesman  ron k which i felt was very unfair it seemed he was doing the best he could with what little he had discover hyundai was a complete waste of time and the dealership is highly dysfunctional top down
they were accommodating with our orders as all five of us had to hold various ingredients from the wrapssandwiches the staff was not rude but not particularly friendly either then we got the food aweful did nt they ever see that oldschool commercial about not drowning your food  all i could taste was the sauce i could nt taste the actual ingredients i did nt think they were particularly fresh plus not much ingredients other than the dressing it was nt particularly healthy or gourmet out of the of us we all said we would nt go back very expected for a casual chain restaurant
i could nt have been more disappointed with my first venture into a two hippies my husband and i rushed home to see who could hammer this place on yelp first lrb he beat me rrb i ordered a hot dog because i love hotdogs this one was large and cheap but the flavor was mostly salt and it looks boiled which did nothing to improve it the bun was excruciatingly hot and as soon as it cooled enough to eat was excruciatingly tough and chewy lrb either overly steamed or overly microwaved rrb hot dog alone would have earned stars but unfortunately i tried to share the hubby s tacos eeeewww the fish mush tacos were downright nasty seriously they were not just lacking good qualities they had a mushy texture and bad taste the pork in the pork tacos was fatty chewy and overly marinated the green beef was tolerable but nowhere near pleasant overall a bad food experience and i came home hungry enough to pig out on christmas cookies atmosphere is fine place is clean service quick and pleasant  but that does not make up for the food
is there a no star rating  minutes dollars car came out clean on the outside just as dirty on the inside when i asked them to clean the inside since i paid for it they did it pathetically again i just went home and cleaned it myself i also enjoyed the guy s swastika tat great place for the kids
prices are low but the service is aweful they put the wrong lug back on one of my tires that could have left me stranded and unable to fix a flat bc my lug wrench would nt fit it they are impossible to deal with to fix this issue since it was a while before i noticed the problem they are also very difficult to get an appointment with do nt waste your time and money here
i m a transplanted texas girl from austin i was craving a taste of home and saw reviews for this place the atmosphere is great the waitress was amusingly surly sadly the food was terrible i do nt understand actually having a disclaimer on your menu that you do nt season your meat  however that would explain the ridiculous amount of condiments at the table i ordered the chicken fried steak and was saaaaaadddly disappointed it is not authentic to not season this dish it literally tasted like a cube steak dipped in a flourwater paste then deep fried no selfrespecting texan would do this and you certainly would nt add pepporcini pepper sauce or cholula sauce to a real cfs the meat was not the only thing unseasoned the chicken tenders potatoes biscuits and pretty much everything else was tasteless and so bad i could nt eat it and i loooove anything fried so this is pretty bad we actually felt kind of bad for them when they saw how much food was on the table and we did nt want a take home box i advise they add salt  pepper at the least
this store drives me crazy i am all for supporting local businesses but not when the local businesses suck this store has the worst layout i have ever seen i can never find anything on multiple occasions i have had to ask a worker where something was only to find out they do nt carry it or the worker does nt even know on top of all that the prices are consistently the highest i have seen i do nt have the time or money to shop here
worst customer service and the manager was not so friendly it used to be better when boca was opened back then
donald s just reminded me i had not reviewed the village tavern yet eat at your own risk i can only tell you my experience and you do with it what you like i la la la loved the food here used to dine in regularly and happy hour often until dun dun dun dun one evening my girlfriends and i rendezvous at the tavern for a little happy hour it was not happy and we left in well under an hour just after being sat in the bar area we saw the biggest freakin rat it would have made ny proud we packed it in and disappeared into the night never to return lrb sad tale for a place i loved so much it s like breaking up with someone you still have feelings for but you know it s the right thing to do
went to this place for the st time cause of a groupon discount i had after the coupon i fed me and my wife and it only came to and to be honest the food was nt worth place is very darkseemed like a bunch of lights either not working and not turned on the biggest problem i had was the girl behind the counter obviously doesnt like her job she seemed very disinterested in taking our order and you could tell she didnt want to be here it really set the wrong mood in the beginning and from then on out it never got better they have a burger called the and its fresh patties seems like a big burger but was really slider thin non fresh patties on a burger it literally took me bites to finish this burger the fries were good but extremely cold i wish i had something good to say about this place cause i really wanted to like it but i just have nothing great to say
i understand that with fast food you ca nt be terribly picky however tonight they completely dropped the ball i ordered fish filet meals large i received medium drinks and some cheeseburgers ok you d think it s a simple mix up no i had to argue with employees to get my order right i left somewhat upset only to be even sooner angry i was  of the way through my fish filet when i found a black piece of plastic safety hazard i m sure i really enjoy mcdonald s from time to time but unfortunately they were unable to keep up their end of the deal  great fast food and service
i do nt reccomend them and they know why the way they treated my husband as a human being and an employee was inhumane and heartless
no i do nt think so i m in the service industry i get out of work and want to have a drink this means i m going to be arriving at your bar later in the evening we walked in at around we ordered two glasses of wine paid for them and plopped down on a couch to relax at exactly on the dot they turned off the music and turned up the lights one manager came over to ask if we were finished i looked at my  filled glass and said no another bartender comes over and asks if we were finished still no but he chose to stand there and watch us while we finished the last few sips aside from the weird ambiance lrb is it a lounge  a bar  a sports bar  rrb the way were treated was beyond rude and unacceptable i will never return and i will tell everyone i know not to come here you do not treat people lrb especially ones who work in the same industry rrb this way and not expect a backlash
i find the apology from the owner a little different than the email he actually sent me on march th i ll let you decide hi teddy rick s has sent you a message on yelp your review teddy i do appreciate your feedback however there are sides to every story yours ours and the truth yoli explained the situation to me as it escalated after she came out to talk to you and your friend i do agree that our server was inappropriate with the comment she made referring to you and your friend being loud and making a scene in public nothing to do with being gay how would she even know  yoli says that your friend repeatedly told her you waited mins not maybe the wait was to long for your taste since you were really hungry it was a beautiful morning and enjoying the patio and the beautiful garden it what people do possibly taking the other tables order was an oversight you stated that since you waited to long you were going to leave and not pay your bill for the coffee that teddy is theft and you would never do that if you where in a store and the line was too long so you just walk out with a drink right  the server more than wanted to accommodate you after you made a fuss including my wife regardless if there were tables or tables full learn to have patience yoli was busy in the kitchen helping make large togo orders many things you do nt know happen in a restaurant we both have family and friends that are part of the lgbt community and we nor our employees would ever discriminate against anyone the whole new level of nd class citizen was really amplified by your friend calling my wife a wetback which you failed to mention in your review he should be ashamed of his actions we care about and even love our customers which you could still be as we invite you and your friend back for breakfast or lunch and we both can make some apologies and have a better day please respond when you have had time to read this and maybe cool off thanks rick and yoli 
we usually do not have issues here and figured it was a safe bet for a quick decent dinner boy were we wrong the service was decent but our food took well over an hour to get to the table i should put a disclaimer here that we have a toddler and long waits can be difficult for us all when the food finally showed up my tritip was really fatty and tough my hubby s food was lukewarm the manager came by but only to tell us that they could nt find our landry s card in the system we were not expecting anything free but an apology for the wait would have been nice i will say that we will not be returning to any claim jumper restaurants landry s has ruined this place
the only reason they have my business is because i m along for the ride already ca nt say they have nt messed up my order in some sort of way those things including simple tasks like reading the order back checking for all the items  even correct greetings i know you can i would like you to and make your money
having spent a good chunk of my life in maui and oahu i know a thing or two about hawaiian food and this is not it this place is an epic failure a chemical warfare assault on your taste buds i ve never had hawaiian food taste like this or taste this bad in my life it was like the owner went to a hawaiian restaurant once and then said you know what i could make this and then set out to make everything from their alzheimer riddled memory banks typical plate lunch style foods should have a main dish served with two scoop rice scoop mac salad and this fit that requirement but execution was terrible at best i tried the bbq ribs which should have been moist sweet and savory and were instead oily and bland served with rice which was sahara dry and should have been a bit sticky and the mac salad which should have been creamy and slightly sweet and was instead inedible my partner had similar issues with their over fried mahi mahi plate and the strange and random array of sauces that accompanied her dish i m not sure anyone could convince me to try this place again as i ca nt imagine wanting to subject myself to this monstrosity
 words not good the mexican food here is as far from authentic as you can get plus it is overpriced i got the chicken tortilla soup to start off with and it was soooo bland and flavorless and loaded with tons of cheesy goop then i got a taco and tostada and both were of lower standards than taco bell lrb i would have preferred a taco bell taco rrb when i go to a mexican restaurant in arizona i expect a freshly fried taco shell not your store bought ortega brand taco shell and i expect shredded beef but at aunt chilada s you get the store bought shells and ground beef i wo nt return
i have frequented unlimited coffee for many years the coffee gelato and comfortable seating was great now the coffee shop allows no outside food lrb even a partially eaten hot dog rrb and has jacked up the prices for soft drinks to close to bucks and hounds people as they walk in to place an order i recently went to order coffee with a friend we had placed our order and then i was told my partially eaten hot dog in an enclosed container was not allowed we left and went to lux coffee and had an enjoyable time i even got to finish my hot dog unlimited coffee use to be a cool coffee shop
first step in buying a new motorcycle is a credit score report chris the loan manager took my app entered the info to his credit dept and it came back no score lrb in other words i dont exist rrb after asking them to see if it was a glitch it still came up empty we then tried using bmw s own financing dept to check my credit score after hour in the shop chris comes back to tell me that i dont qualify for the minimum credit requirement of pts this is a surprise to me first checks can not find any info on me second lrb this being the rd attempt by chris rrb i get turned down and sent packin i came home got a free credit check that uses all three major credit score companies  experion equifax and transunion  and all three of them far exceed the minimum expected by bmw long story short the loan manager is an incompetent hack and he lost a sale on a bike the store manager todd seemed like a nice guy to talk to but i wonder does he realize his crew is incompetent 
went for lunch with my wife who works in the area the place was loud  crowded we waited minutes to be seated and the service went downhill from there i ordered a beer server asked for my id which i handed him and he ran off with it lrb i assumed to check it rrb minutes later he returns with my id but not my beer i finally got my beer shortly after the food is overpriced and marginal at best it seems like it is a place to go to be seen as long as you do nt care about mediocre food at a biltmore district price when we were ready to leave we waited for the bill then waited some more then more waiting the group of next to us at the table was in the same boat  where is our server  our bill  i finally got up walked over to the manager  asked for our bill and the bill for the party next to us he of course apologized we paid which took the server way too long to process and left i will not be back  i doubt the party next to us will be either
weak drinks and overpriced bar food make this place very low on my radar however we went with a group of friends for the veteran s day deal where they provided a free meal to veterans i was meeting someone for lunch later so i only had a drink everyone else ordered a meal lrb including the veterans in our group rrb here we are days later and every single person that ate there all have flu symptoms i feel fine and coincidentally i did nt order anything to eat some line cook was probably sick and they would nt let him call out since they were busy for the holiday way to give some veterans the flu with their free meal applebee s
horrible customer service i was canceled on minutes before a yard design meeting that i took time away from my job to be home for i was told he just got out of a meeting and then he ll be out of town for a week  this is the same type of excuses i ve heard from previous contractors
food  star  are you kidding me  how does a place like this stay in business  maybe everyone goes there once as we did but never returns we ordered carne asada quesadilla tacos and margaritas the drinks were actually really good the food was significantly better at taco bell across the street and our bill was times the price i seriously want my money back i should have complained but i m sure they ll be out of business soon enough
have you people not gone to a good pho place  hands down the worst vermicelli dish i ever had and my friend was nt fond of his pho the egg roll tasted of mushy grease the pork lacked flavor the rice paper for the spring roll was still dehydrated and crunchy in spots i m not from arizona so i m not sure if this is the best your state has to offer which is indicated from the rest of the reviews i feel sorry and sad
if you want inattentive service and the worst wedge salad in arizona nimbus is open days a week very disappointed with this experience and the apathy shown towards us when we addressed our concerns they did at least comp the salad
i agree with the previous reviewer it seems like a great concept but not executed well it seemed barely surviving when i went in there with a few token scrawny pieces of organic produce but the rest was pretty much stuff i could find at any grocery store cans of coca cola  really 
service is always bad management not friendly
stopped by this morning for a turkey and swiss on a sunflower bagel i was terribly disappointed on the bagel being hard as a rock threw out the sandwhich do nt think i will be back anytime in the near future
sorry mark i have to mostly disagree with you on this one i do agree that they have great dogs so maybe that s why they do nt actually want to adopt them and i hate to be down on an organization who is trying to do a good thing but a couple a weeks ago a friend who volunteers for the rescue had taken one of the dogs out of the kennel he is staying in and brought him to the fat tire festival at tempe town lake i fell in love with the little guy his name is jalen and called my fiance to see if he d come meet him too he did he loved him so we decided to see if we could adopt him after filling out the online application lrb the only way to put in an application rrb which took over an hour we waited the three business days they gave as the time frame that it could take to get back to us three days passed nothing so i called and emailed them to see if they even received the application no response so i asked my friend to find out next time he went to volunteer if they had gotten it they told him that the website must be broken because they did not receive it so i asked him to see if they got the email or voicemail no  okaaaay what the hell  well my volunteer friend brought over jalen to our house to meet our other dogs and cat to see if he would even fit in here they all got along just fine seriously they all got along even with the cat robert calls me later when he gets back to the rescue and says they found my application but they still did nt call me back so we emailed them and called again finally one and a half weeks after we filled out the online application a woman calls me with a list of excuses of why jalen would not be a good fit she told me that the cat is a concern that the dog is terrified of cats lrb even though it says on his description on their website we have nt found anyone jalen does nt get along with  cats dogs humans  he s just so mildmannered rrb i told her he met my cat and they were indifferent to eachother there were other excuses she had it was like she was reading them off a list finally after being on the phone with her for a half an hour and it was obvious she did nt want to actually adopt the dog to anyone i told her i had to get back to work she then calls back ten minutes later saying that if we were okay with pottytraining jalen lrb apparently all of the other excuses she gave me were going to be disregarded now rrb that a volunteer could come over on saturday morning to asses the situation we said absolutely see you then a senior volunteer lrb with the adopting powers rrb came over this morning everyone got along great our pets are very loved and cared for but she had a problem with us keeping our dogs outside when it s nice out like today when we leave the house we do nt think they should be crated up when it s so nice out our dogs like to be outside in our big backyard able to run around and lay in the grasssun not in a little crate inside so she told us to keep the dogs inside when we leave the house for days and see how that goes and then call them back and they would come back over to reassess and she took jalen back to the kennel where he has been staying waiting for a good home needless to say we were pretty disappointed that they did nt adopt to us and completely disenchanted with the organization we ve adopted through a rescue before and did nt have any problems i d try valleydogsorg or wwwakitaadvocatescom of you re looking for another rescue
havana cafe refused my business today when i walked into their establishment wearing a trendy bluish turquoise singlet apparently this wannabe star cafe that resides in a plaza for god s sakes has a clothing rule that says men have to wear sleeves but women do not i challenged keith the waiterproprietor that my date was also wearing a similar sleeveless top and he proceeded to tell me that men are not allowed to wear sleeveless tops and that if i were to eat there i would have to wear one of his awful red hawaiian print polos with bamboo images on it that was two sizes too big wtf  so you d rather offend me and require me to wear some crap hawaiian shirt that i m swimming in  mind you it s degrees out in what world is this more appropriate attire than my tank and not outright sexual discrimination  for those of you who think this is a joke it actually happened
absolutely hands down the worst sushi i ve ever had i would nt even say the food was fishstick grade much less sushi grade the wasabi was bland my salmon roll was warm  fishy smelling and the order came out so fast i swear it had to have been premade if they offered me free sushi for life i still would never go back never yuck
on first appearance this hotel is your typical franchise hotel inside and out from the gold rating you would assume that the customer service would be outstanding and it is ive stayed one night and really enjoyed the clean room and free lrb continental buffet rrb breakfast so why am i giving them such a low rating  management is less to be desired the gm is the week link and the results will be the loss of their gold status too bad too because the rest of the staff rocks
very nice service here but the food was not good we had multiple items from the menu and none of it was good the decor is somewhat depressing all in all it made us wish we were eating chinese in san fran
i pulled into the vig on accident one day while meeting a friend for lunch across the street the building is very chic and the place looked exactly like a place i wanted to visit later so today my fianc and i went in for lunch let it first be mentioned that we checked the star rating here on yelp star too bad we did nt read the reviews because this place was not worth the effort the design of the restaurant is great i guess i should start by saying this is not a real restaurant this is more like a lounge with an extended menu ordered the hummus sliders satay and pad thai hummus was not good much better out of a jar at any supermarket sliders were okay a little greasy looking satay was cold not on purpose just not properly cooked or served the pad thai was a disaster normally we are intelligent enough to avoid ordering something like this in a mock fusion restaurant but the menu was so limited we did nt really have a choice the noodles were so overlooked they were mushed and the dish was over spiced probably to overcompensate for the poor quality we ordered the bread pudding to go for the record i love bread pudding any bread pudding pretty much this stuff was terrible i literally spit it into my kitchen sink beyond disappointed what a waste of potential now i have to look for someplace to deliver because i could nt eat anything at my lunch my fianc had a clemintine specialty cocktail they should be embarrassed to serve something like that
another yelp twilight zone episode my good friend and i look on yelp to find a new chinese restaurant to eat at and decide to try dragon palace based on these ratings but this place is nowhere near as good as it s rated here we were enthusiastic when we entered and felt like we walked into  the interior is very retro kitsch but looking at people s dishes on the way to our table i could see the food was not going to be anything special turns out dragon palace is a bottomrung chinese restaurant dirty plates rusty teapots subpar ingredients frozen vegetables canned mushrooms weak sauces and the cheapest quality of fatty gristly meats it was so bad i sent my dinner back and asked for a refund you d be better off looking in the phonebook for chinese restaurants closing your eyes putting your finger down on the page and going to whatever place your finger landed on
staff at door requested charge to enter lol no thanks we ve been before and overpaid for your soso drinks  it s your loss
please go somewhere else overpriced
i rely on yelp reviews more often than i take the initiative to write one that will no longer be the case like others we noticed how empty the place was at on a saturday night never a good sign and a head later we understood why linguine with clams not much flavor laughing bird shrimp risotto very bland and soupy orecchiette overpowered by salty local sausage special on the menu gnocchi with chorizo was just ok not the quality we expected caesar salad was good but pricey tiramisu was served in a chocolate cup unique and tasty service was slow other tables appeared to be hotel guests not locals
 met with a few friends who d already started drinking during happy hour lrb read p rrb and finished dinner before i arrived around p serendipitously found a great parking spot across the front entrance i knew i would nt enjoy my stay here when i was hit by such loud chattering as soon as i opened the front door that and the scent of rancid beer that greeted me were enough to make me want to bolt but i d already let my friends know i d arrived via text and yelp checkin found my friends at a fourtop sat down and proceeded to shout hellos  strike three i really dislike having to shout to a person who s sittingstanding right beside me to be heard what s even worse is having to nuzzle my ear to their mouth to understand what they re saying really made me wish i was at mellow four peaks already sipping on a cold pint of peach ale and waiting on dinner to arrive i sat at that table for twenty minutes watching at least three different servers pass by without stopping to ask if i needed anything thank goodness i brought my bottle of water with me or i would ve been really annoyed because not only were my head and ears aching from the noise but i was also hungry and very thirsty as well it was only around the minute mark while i and two other friends were standing by a landing of stairs did a server stop and ask if i had been helped by that time i d already made up my mind to leave and was already saying goodbye to my friends too bad i could nt get any love oz beer samplers are or lrb those designated with a plus sign rrb would ve been a fun way to taste my way through the menu while checking out just how well the servers know the beers they offer  i m a newbie to the world of beers but i already know i do nt like a lot of hops pints are each lrb boo rrb but per pitcher lrb awesome rrb and that s not even happy hour prices a pint of local brewery four peaks is  what  i expected to see a lot of ohso brewery beers but i only spotted two but i should nt have even bothered to study all of this since i never received service
cold food delivered an hour and min after we ordered it at least it was bland st and last order here
my husband and i thought we d be able to have a nice little dinner at a mexican restaurant but it turns out it s party central we saw girls walking in with slutty dresses and heels and saw people in the back partying if that s your thing go for it looking for douchebag central instead of a restaurant  drink away this is for you
i will not choose to go back to this place i had a martini it was ok other people had the suishi again they said it was  ok mostly the customer service here is awful do nt go in with a group they force everyone at a table to be one ticket they will not split a ticket will not i even talked to a manager and they refused to do this i felt like i was imposing on them for bringing them business do nt go here there are plenty of good suishi places around that will actually appreciate you business do nt do it
i lived down the street from carly s for years and only managed to go there once that was one salty miserable biddy at the bar and from what i could see that s the kind of trick they always like to hire i am not trying to have an adversarial relationship with someone who is bringing me drink and food place reeks of the famous phoenix snarkiness f that
extremely disappointed the morton s in sf has a great reputation so we figured we d take our friend from dc here have never been visited a mortons before this the steaks were mediocre ruth chris even pinnacle peak patio steaks tasted better our friend s steak that he ordered was rare lrb he ordered medium rrb and had to be taken back when it came back it was charred on the outside but still rare by that time my husband and i were  way done w  our meal our friend decided to switch the steak for another cut he was unfortunately facing the kitchen where he got bird s eye view of the chef s arguing and visibly upset by this steak situation they did bring out the new cut which was better cooked but our friend was questioning whether or not he should taste it when we had originally ordered he also preordered a dessert bc we were told it took  to prepare after he was done w  the steak they did bring out the dessert but after the issues w  the steaks he forgot he ordered it and no longer had an appetite for it this is the kicker rather than the waiter saying it was on the house as some form of compensatory effort he quickly took it back i know if i was the manager i would have tried to compensate for the whole situation i would have credited the customer with the bad experience not so here not only bad meal experience expensive but also poor managerial decision will never go back and do not recommend skip this place and go to another steakhouse you wo nt regret i
horrible waiter  rudest i have ever experienced food did come out way too fast  artichoke dip in minutes  have to agree with other reviewer that a lot of menu is microwaved but in my opinion our server daniel was what made the experience the worst
if i could put zero stars i would food is nice and all but service is most important i believe lisa g herself is the woman who asked me and my boss and my boss s boss to leave our table and meet elsewhere so she could seat more people in the restaurant that s nice thanks for nothing anyhow the bowl of balls were nothing to yelp about and i was quite disappointed that they carry the oddest soda flavors do nt ask what it is your server thinks you are a whack job for not know knowing what the beverage selection is i m a bit bitter maybe bc i suggested the restaurant to my bosses and then got treated like dirt it looks so cute from the outside lrb and really is in the inside rrb and since i live in the neighborhood i like to try out the new restaurants and bars anyhow lisa g and her staff can take the balls and shove it
notorious turned out to be true to its name leaving me woefully disappointed with the experience and a gift that kept on giving all night long so last night we went to the notorious pig a good sized group of to enjoy a dinner together after not seeing one another for a month we did spend a half hour waiting for our friends to arrive so the four of us sat around talking it took a while for the server to offer drinks but we were fairly distracted however when our friends arrived it took almost twenty minutes for their drink order to be taken our drinks were never refilled and we were minutes in after our other friends arrived before getting our food when our food finally arrived my plate was lukewarm at best like it had been sitting out for a while with such a limited menu i do nt understand why it took so long so the hotlinks were tasty but not warm the rib tips and shredded chicken breast were both lukewarm and dry i did not have the confidence that addressing the temperature of my meal would have been adequately resolved at this point the rest of the evening was a pleasant little dance of getting one last refill on my drink lrb we asked two other servers to help us out to no avail as our waiter did not check up on us rrb and getting our waiters attention to get the check it was when i looked in the main dining area and found our waiter watching the ufc fight with the other customers inside that i had my ah hah moment the waiter waitstaff kitchen staff were not serving or working they were watching tv with the rest of the customers inside when i mean watch i mean fully fixated on the tv and not doing any work for minutes little did i know that after the check the gift of my evening at notorious would come to its conclusion after our three hour experience i had an entire evening of experiences that have been burned into my mind notorious left me frustrated and literally sick well into the morning hours
so after the phoenix k we decided to check this new joint out btw my performance on the run was pretty pathetic anywho the restaurant was in this old shopping center the ones that have parking really close to the road you had to order at the counter and choose where ever you wanted to sit there was quite a big outside seating area in the back of the joint we started off with biscuits  gravy it was disgusting its like someone opened a can of gravy they probably serve at a nursing home and poured it on pretty sad looking biscuits for breakfast i ordered a breakfast burrito with six toppings on it  sausage cheddar cheese jalapenos ham onions and peppers even with all those toppings the burrito was quite small and pretty bland in taste the decor was pretty hippyish no surprise i liked it wo nt go back or recommend it to anyone
first some of my background  years as a waitress hostess catering captain catering business owner we arrived at pm on  the first words out of the hostessowner s mouth were do you have a reservation  not a good sign i snuck a peek at the reservation book and there were a handful before pm but no more i said that no we thought we were safe coming in at she gave us the stinkeye and proceeded to make a big deal about finding a table this while there were maybe tables occupied in the whole place we should have taken the opportunity to say thank you very much and turned around and walked away but we did not having been wanting to try this place for a long time we sat and were waited on by the hostess herself cordial enough but no offering of a wine list or anything clearly getting the bum s rush from the beginning we opted for a glass each of the house wine since no other options were given lrb generally we would order a bottle rrb the wine was horrible watered down and flavorless we ordered prime rib lrb traditional cut rrb for each salad bar was small but good and fresh meals were timed quickly after the salad was cleared prime rib was decent mine was not medium rare but more medium barely room temp i had the steamed veggies which were done fine husband had baked potato we were quickly offered coffee which we refused at this point we could nt get out of there quickly enough while the food was decent and the prices were reasonable it was the initial treatment and the feeling of needing to free up the table that will keep us from ever returning next time we will stay and have dinner at dick s hideaway where we had cocktails before venturing into feeney s
one star because zero is nt an option i hate picking people up or dropping them off here but far worse is having to fly to or from here wheelchair service is a joke it already is awful to need thus service they should make it easier and not make you feel like garbage for needing it then there s the restrooms both on the way out and on return they were worse than most gas stations i ve visited gross i would rather drive at least as far as a better airport
worst service ever slow would be a compliment and the managment does nt care oh and the food sucks and the coffee tastes like water avoid
i ve been a chipotle fan for years and have had consistent positive experiences at their restaurants unfortunately when i went to the new chipotle at the scottsdale pavilions today for lunch i was very disappointed by the terrible quality of my order i ordered online from my office lrb as i usually do to avoid the lunch line rrb the restaurant itself is very nice  smaller than most chipotles but the decor is very modern and pleasant i always order crunchy chicken tacos and the quality and consistency has generally been very good however that was not the case today the chicken was all dark meat instead of breast meat and was greasy and gristly my crunchy taco shells were soaked and soggy with grease by the time i got back to my office lrb less than minutes rrb i managed to stomach a few bites but i threw the rest away if this is chipotle s attempt to increase profits by marginalizing quality they ve lost me as a customer permanently charge me an extra and keep the quality
clarendon park apartments suck it charging me to clean my tub lrb pahleeze i make felix unger look like a slob rrb for a broken towel rack lrb which had been wobblly since day one and repaired several times rrb and a carpet cleaning charge on carpet that is years old and i know you replaced it after i moved out suck it you ll never get that money from me not funny people but hopefully useful and i tried oh i tried to be cool
on the way to this restaurant my year daughter had asked what notorious means i explained that it means something along the lines of being famous for being bad little did i know notorious pig would definitely live up to its name never again my boyfriend daughter and i were excited to discover a bbq joint near our house my daughter got the sliders and mashed potatoes with gravy the sliders lrb from the kid s menu rrb were inedible i almost got annoyed at my daughter for being too picky until i took a taste for myself the brisket slider tasted horrible  it was like chewing on burnt rubber the pork slider was way too spicy for a child the mashed potatoes were watery i ordered the pulled pork with a side of mashed and texas toast okay so first of all if i m going to a restaurant i expect the texas toast to taste better than those from the frozen food section in the supermarket uh yeah no the texas toast from this restaurant is just regular toasted white bread with no taste i had to put butter on it just so it would taste like something the pulled pork was the most bland bbq pork i have ever had in my life i left half of it on the plate even in my hungry state very disappointing one thing that was good was the cookie sundae they made the cookie fresh we all shared it and thought it was great but maybe that was because we were starving from having left behind half of our dinners do not waste your time or money on this place it is notoriously bad
i ve been a good customer at fletcher s and when my explorer was nt handling properly i took it in i told them that i was tight on funds and just wanted things made right as inexpensively as possible they told me i needed new struts all around and new control arms  i took it to a friend and he pointed out that the control arms are fine lrb he showed me how to tell rrb and he pointed out that the rear struts are strong lrb there was no excess rocking or bounce rrb i did some research and he was right i ordered the front struts and installed them myself for thanks fletcher s for your crap estimate i wo nt be back
i ordered the homemade turkey sandwich and i got lettuce tomatoes cheese and pulled turkey thrown in shabbily between two slices of bread the messiest and most unappealing looking sandwich i ever ate tasteless too do nt even bother eating here i m sure walmart which is at a walking distance from this place can make a better sandwich
so i m a business student and while i ve attended this school i ve discovered a formula asu  money hungry  bad service to student who pay thousands of dollars to go there ca nt wait to graduate
rudest server ever named sunny had to leave right after we ordered because we were a fraid she would spit in our food we told manager and he could care less  i have never experienced such an unprofessional establishment definately needs new management if there allow this from staff
i experienced some of the worst customer service here that i ve ever had in the restaurant industry the staff consisted of snotty teenage girls who were extremely rude to my mother when she simply asked them to pack the tomatoes for her sandwich separately and they did nt understand meanwhile the manager just stood there and stared into space as my exasperated mother attempted to communicate what she wanted to no avail we finally just gave up and went to the ray and th st franchise as we were walking out the door the girls started laughing and pointing at us i will never go there again
my husband and i have dined at pappadeaux in beaumont and austin tx and had fabulous experiences at both in fact our service was so fantastic in beaumont during the busy lunchtime rush that we still remember our watier by name lrb thanks trevor rrb all i can say is the phoenix location bears no resemblance to the places we visited in the lone star state having read some of the other reviews it seems everyone has had the same experience with respect to having to wait in line endlessly for a table even midweek we waited over half an hour for a table on a wednesday evening the bar was too packed to find a seat and no matter where we stood as we waited we seemed to be in someone s way and yes this place is extremely noisy we could nt hear ourselves think when we were finally seated in a drafty spot in the middle of the room i ended up putting earplugs in lrb i travel by air a lot so always have a pair handy in my handbag rrb even then the noise gave me a headache we found ourselves shouting across the table to each other to be heard and even the server had difficulty hearing us when she came to take our order  she had to stoop over and practically put her ear to our mouths we ordered some appetizers  a small salad and a cup of soup  which took over half an hour to arrive the waitress apologized profusely and seemed flustered and run off her feet  i felt kind of bad for her with the noise and high traffic it ca nt be a fun place to work the entrees came out not long after and my seafood mixed grill which i d enjoyed immensely in both other locations arrived at the table sizzling and white with grease the side of soggy steamed broccoli which i d specifically ordered plain was greasy to the touch and there was a huge pool of butter on the mashed potatoes  and an extra cup of butter on the side when i voiced my discontent the waitress assured us that the grilled fish had simply been lightly brushed in oil and that there was nothing on the broccoli lrb it was glistening  i ran my finger across it several times and i could have used it as hand lotion it was so heavily coated rrb she offered to take it back and make something different and the manager came to the table and said she understood we were nt happy  a good business move which i appreciate  but having invested so many hours in the experience already and having a headache from the noise we just wanted to get out of there they boxed the uneaten food which i put in the frig when i got home for my husband to eat i took it out the next day and about a quarter cup of oil had slid off the fish and congealed at the bottom of the styrofoam container lrb i m not exaggerating rrb i ran my finger across the broccoli again just to check that my original assessment had been correct crisco city i ended up tossing it  it was just too disgusting to eat the bill for hours of waiting deafening noise and greasy inedible food  not including the tip save yourself some time and money and go to mcdonald s instead it s faster and the fish sandwich is probably healthier and definitely cheaper
went here last friday night around pm food was great but employees were disgusting of course i expected teenagers to be working at a sub shop on a friday night but these teens were a different breed the kid taking our order yawned without covering his mouth while entering our order into the register he looked like he had nt showered in months had erratic facial hair and sat on an open trash can while taking the order all of the kids acted completely un interested in making sure we had what we needed they gave us someone else s sandwich and i would nt be surprised if he wrapped it back up and gave it to the correct person after i had already opened it and touched it as we left my dad lrb an older gentleman rrb decided to order a cookie i headed out the door to wait outside i watched as he paid and turned around to walk out the door the kids pointed and laughed behind his back while mocking him as he walked away it took everything inside of me not to walk back in and put them in their place these kids need a lesson in respect
i just moved from sf to scottsdale and went to this gym to check it out i met with a membership person by the name of khieser and all his only motive was to sell me a membership that day he was a used car sales person working in a gym i asked him to see if i could try the gym for a couple of days and he said no they do nt do that he lied later i checked on there website and they offer a day free pass anyways horrible customer service
the food drinks and service at the bar during happy hour on friday april th were horrible the supposed corporate trainer bartender made the worst drinks jampaced with iceyou only got about drinks out of the glass before it was empty the bar was filthy dirty and she did not clean up after customers and we waited a long time only to get cold food the place was not busy as it was only pm  absolutely no excuse if she is a corp trainer then they are in trouble
okay to quote the stones  you re not the only one with mixed emotions i am and will continue to be a loyal sw airlines customer i ve only traveled with them and i must say i dont have any complaints with the pilots sexy stews and the quality of their planes prices yada yada yada but lrb and this is an epic but like kim kardashian s or j lo s or kirstie alley s or well you get the picture rrb whoever the ambivalent imp who haphazardly handled this patrons luggage on my return trip from california is should be dragged out from his hiding place sealed inside the thunderdome and viciously torn to shreds by a mutant with retard strength  while i cackle from a platform with a silver lightning shaped streak in my jew fro and the sequins on my bedazzled tina turner outfit glimmer in the dusk of a day permeated with my vengeance  cough cough  ahem where was i oh yeah my huge beef with this airline is how careless the baggage handlers are i ve watched them unload peoples bags from their little carts they drive around the tarmac on and those guys act as if they re lobbing piles of garbage off a dump truck i have no had a vintage wwii rucksack my uncle gave me for christmas one year that i used to use for all my travels it was sturdy and had survived a fucking world war for christ sake well once the careless monkeys sw employs to handle their customers baggage got their mits on it it returned to me from the baggage carousel with two of its leather straps broken and some articles missing giant wtf moment for me minor incident for them no scratch that it isnt an incident if you cant even get an apology out of a single one of their employees needless to say nowadays i pack light enough to ensure i dont have to check my bags
the last time i rated a jersey mike s subs i gave  mike s a a high review for me and i would have recommended it to anyone thing have changed the tuna hoagie is crap do nt get it it is sloppy wet and soaks the roll they have apparently changed vendors for their meats the turkey is almost tasteless the meats for the italian sub are also not what they used to be we called the happy valley store to complain after we discovered the changes the  person in charge said that  corporate had changed the supplier for the tuna and they knew it was awful so why did nt you tell me before i bought the sandwich  if you know it s that bad why are you serving it  it looks like the local franchisee is looking to max out profits at the expense of quality jersey mike s is off my list check what they are putting in your sandwich before you get burned too
had lunch here with mom a few months ago  calamari app and a pie calamari was alright nothing to rave about and certainly not something i d order again plus the batter contained cornmeal lrb corn allergy rrb and i m not a fan of anything that contains cheap ingredients esp those that do great harm to people s health the pie was nt memorable at all  i can not even remember which one we had  it was that mediocre the first pie was charred all over why it was allowed to leave the kitchen and served on a table we ll never know i do give management some credit since they quickly replaced it with a betterlooking yet nonscintillating pie that had more dough than toppings strike three the noise level was ridiculously high and the restaurant was only at  capacity you wo nt find me dining here on a weekend night based on the terrible acoustics alone no you wo nt see me spending my money here again
called in for a to go order when we got there to pick up our food we waited for an hour to get our food i do nt care if the chicken is good it s not worth the wait
ate here twice and was just became more disappointed the first time i ate here was probably months ago an old guy served us he was okay there were no people inside even it s lunch time the food was ordinary but pricey like bucks a pho i would ve gone to saigon pho if i wanted cheaper or to unphogettable or chandler pho if i wanna pay extra but have decently flavored food the atmosphere is modern clean the second time i had to go and this lady server lrb i m assuming owner hear me out why rrb was extremely loud and annoying touching customers in unnecessary ways like patting the back while eating she was dancing and really was all over the place lrb i m thinking a bit drunk rrb anyway no i will not come back anymore i have no idea why people visit this place it s either they do nt know a much better viet cuisine or they have no choice
you can come here for happy hour drinks but do not under any circumstances eat dinner here
i took my grandkids there for the weekend of july the water slides and lazy river kept getting closed down for over a half hour at a time it wrecked the whole vacation for the kids i have been there a couple of times but will go somewhere else next summer
i hate giving it one star salsa taste like marinara i asked for the hottest salsa still tasted like marinara this is another mexican food for white people but what to you expect considering location  it s too expensive makes me want to open my own mexican food place i mean for a taco  the beans are good i hate the neon lights they hurt my eyes and make reading the menu a headache if you want better mexican food go to la piata
i hate to do drop this down to star but i just have to i took my parents and grandparents here for a special dinner and everyone loved the food until we saw a roach climbing the wall behind us while waiting for our bill it completely overshadowed what would have been a great evening we ended up waiting for our bill at the front of the restaurant and i discreetly let the server know what the issue was was they were super apologetic but that only goes so far honestly i wo nt be back luckily there s another location near by that i ve also been to that has just as good food lrb note menu s are not the same between locations which i find odd but interesting rrb
we should have read the yelp reviews before going to this place but after now bad experiences i feel the need to write a review do not go here the first time we went it was to get new tubes for my bike we even brought a tube in so we would get the correct size replacements this older man working at the counter was like a mrknowitall barely looking at the tire and spouting off what size he thought it was then he goes to the back and gets us the replacement tubes which we bought then brought home upon putting these tubes on my bike they were the wrong size so back we went to exchange them yet they apparently ran out of thorn resistant tubes for my schwinn so we bought the regular ones funny thing is this man told us that they are the only bike shop in phx to carry thorn resistant tubes for schwinn yet we were nt sure why they had none in stock a week later the tubes popped and we went back to get replacements again and again this useless man gave the wrong size we are bringing them back now and telling him we are never go back there again there are plenty of other better bike shops in phx and scottsdale i ll just find one with good ratings on yelp
bad experience here with a rude cashier my husband and i split our items into two orders to pay with two different cards and we were given a nasty attitude we wont be back to this costco
fool me once shame on you fool me other times because i tried to give your restaurant the benefit of the doubt and i will not return despite one experience with good service there have been six other times when i have had incredibly awful service that s not a good ratio and at this point i just ca nt justify coming back nor would i recommend rnr at all my most recent experience sealed the one star review first there was no one to greet us at the door and seat us we sat ourselves then we sat at a table for about minutes no waiter to be seen no one even came around to serve the other tables around us with patrons ah ha next we spot a waiter after inquiring with this individual as to where our waiter wasif they were closing or something lrb trying to give them benefit of the doubt rrb the waiter looked at us begrudgingly gave us a half eye roll and said i guess i can serve you well after that remark i just wanted to get up and walk out but i stayed lrb a decision that i now regret rrb only to experience more poor service we needed more drinks our waiter was nowhere to be found then we noticed all the waiters hanging out near the order input computers the restaurant was nt crowded and i know my order was nt being taken or put into the computer instead it looked like social hour unprofessional this is not the first time that i have experienced inattentive and nowheretobeseen service at rnr and i guess i should have known better i do nt even think my request to be seated so that i could have a waiter take my order was that outlandish i work very hard for my money to be able to enjoy some rnr on the weekends so with lots of other places lrb like az old town tavern mabel s on main firehouse pattie s the lodge geshiaagogo and the list could go on rrb where i can count on being served by an actual live body nonetheless who does nt even make me feel like they hate me just because i walked through the door there s no reason to come here it was especially awful to be treated so poorly when i m a giants fan and my team s flag is hanging out front of the establishment i m going to pass on anymore of this place s rnr as i m pretty sure it actually stands for really rude service
i am just graduated from asu and i have avoided mill avenue like the plague unless it was at night why would i pay alot of money just to park where my car is nt even watched just to get hassled by homeless and begged for spare change by drug addicts i feel like im in an episode of walking dead when i am on this street not only are there homeless and pieces of trash lingering and begging there is literally trash everywhere and everything is dirty if you are a guy the only store for you is urban outfitters so the shopping also sucks i have no problem making the drive to scottsdale where you do nt pay to park theres no homeless and the only drugs users than affect you are the roid monkies
ok this restaurant is under new ownership or it may be it used to be greek with delicious food now it has gyros which are nt right and it turned it to greasy burger joint i ordered a gyro in a pita and i had to put it together myself sauce on the side some kind of preformed meat that was supposed to be lamb tomatoes large chopped onions and no lettuce the pita was greasy from the grill it came with fries or soup i said i do nt want fries so they said i could have cream of spinach soup did nt want that either so my friend took it we got water never got them refilled finally asked for lemon and they refilled them we sat there for an hour and minutes without food if i had my own car i would have walked out we went there since a friend knew the cook well it was as greasy there as when he worked at where we live where i never ate anyway due to the smell of grease was totally disgusted and the dog will eat the rest tomorrow sorry but this place has changed everyone for the lunch crowd got served before we did the waitress came over and said the cook is doing it with love for you i said the heck with love give us hate and put some food on the table i wish it was like it was i hate to review places that i loved the last time i went there but and hour and minutes for a bad gyro was uncalled for and i saw that nobody has reviewed it since you want burgers and fries go to another place it will be cheaper
nicelooking building from the outside w  beautiful views of one of the manmade lakes nearby i really enjoyed the walks i took in the park that this branch is located in using the library though is another story in the times i ve visited this location was either closed or full of noisy children and preteens who ran in and out of its doors unattended and people of all ages who talked loudly on their cellphones the computer section was always crowded and i could never find a seat to use or an empty table void of backpacks and other items left there by their absentee owners i d say that for the most part this library looked and sounded more like a coffee shop lrb there s a section where you can purchase coffee and some pastries rrb than a quiet library where one may hope to do some productive work there was a goodsized selection of cds dvds and booksondvds which i used a couple of times that allowed you to place holds onsite and online and this service was fairly prompt at notifying me of the availability for pickup but i quit using the services when my hands and anything that the items touched started to smell of body odor from the previous users that handled them lrb i think that many of the handlers carried the items under their armpits as they walked back to the library which i m sure we ve all done before w  books and other items but think about it  we do live in the middle of the desert and bodies do get hot and sweaty rrb no matter how many times i wiped the items down w  sanitizing cloths and washed my hands w  soap and sanitized them the odor would nt disappear utterly disgusting and i m not exaggerating do nt believe me  pick up a dvd or book on your next visit and take a whiff do nt say i did nt warn you come for the relaxingenergizing walks and views around the lakes there s even a playground or two on the other end of the park for children to play in and many picnic areas w  grills and tables to use you can even go fishing lrb just do nt expect to eat what you catch though  the lakes are contaminated w  toxins and algae lrb there are signs rrb and i ve seen more than a few floaters and dead small animals bobbing in the water rrb if you plan to walk all of the paths make sure you have a friend or two accompanying you esp around sunset bec there s a specific location that only has one entry and exit which could become dangerous  if someone s stalking or following you w  malicious intent well you re sol i hope your experiences at this library turn out better than mine
i gave this place a nd shot a few months after our st experience service was terrible both times no music the movie outside was distracting because it was complete silence and this bright movie cocktails are very over priced especially for the amature mixologists i will not go back or suggest this place i am shocked they are still in business sad because it could be very cool
ok so i thought i would give this place a tryone more time since everyone raves about it i will not make that mistake again i should have just left it alone and stuck to my original opinion ok but nothing special now i must say my last experience was horrible to start the water tasted awful and the chips were cold and stale how can you mess up a cheese crisp well the tee pee did again cold my taco was made incorrectly and the chimi my friend got not so good i love good ol mexican food but this place has missed the mark thank god they have nostalgia working in there favor
i do nt even know where to begin we came in on wednesday and really enjoyed our food and service we enjoyed it so much that we decided to return last night lrb sunday rrb it was clearly busier than it had been during the day however the experience was not what we had hoped for we checked in with the hostesses and were told the wait would be  minutes we decided to put our name on the list and grab a drink at the bar they do nt have pagers so we wanted to stick near by in hopes a table would open up it took nearly minutes for the bartenders to notice us at the end of the bar waiting to order a drink i will say we all enjoyed our margaritas but the wait was a little much as we finished up our drinks we realized we had been waiting for minutes at this point checked with the hostess stand and they said another  minutes waiting waiting waiting another minutes went by and then we were seated we were surprised because we noticed multiple vacant tables where we were seated and wondered why we had not been seated sooner knowing we could have been in and out by this point we first thought perhaps they were all reserved  but we did not see anyone sit at any of these at any point we started off with the guacamole and then ordered our entrees our server returned quite some time after we had ordered our entrees and let us know one of the items we had ordered had been d for the night we wondered why it not only took him this long to let us know but why our entree orders were being put in after so much time had elapsed at this point there were three people at our table and one persons order came out first the server was apologetic but she finished her entire meal before mine and the other persons came out the timing could not have been more off the food was not as great as the first time and neither was our experience our server was kind but full of excuses two of us at the table work in a restaurant and understand things happen and problems do occur however we both felt it could have been handled much better we wo nt be rushing back here anytime soon if at all
i detest this store soooo much this is like a kmart and goodwill crashed and made a baby no the stuff is nt donated but the items are definitely bottom of the barrel quality bad lighting awful cramped spaces and a general aura of disorder and mess if you need cheap stuff or you need stuff now then yes it s good for that if you want something good something that ll last more than one or two days then this is not that
trying way too hard on aesthetics and not trying hard enough to book people in unoccupied rooms a terrible experience handled terribly with terrible followup earns this hotel an unapologetic terrible review if you have five minutes read on to enjoy a laugh at my expense because this was a nightmare stay three colleagues and i booked here for a valentine s day business trip i arrived later than they did so after a late dinner i had to find my room at am the property layout and room numbering is tricky and no map is provided lrb tip if you dare stay  bldg rd flr rrb i did nt have the hotel phone  so after wandering in the dark feeling unsafe i finally called my colleague to dial the front desk to guide me the hotel actually sent security to find me which was nice but the only compliment i ll be able to provide from here forward what ensued after was the worst hotel experience i have ever had ever a man in a black hoodie appears out of the darkness to help me find my room lrb not an ideal uniform choice rrb security escorts me to hallway leaves key does nt work call colleague to call front desk to send security back security returns and lets me into a room with someone sleeping in it i ll just pause to let that sink in initially security s key does nt work either and he comments that it s as if the privacy lock is engaged so he uses the master key to open the door and send the woman who is asleep in her bed into a terrified state of confusion and panic as strangers appear in her bedroom oops security backs out with no apology or explanation to her and shuts the door i m stunned security tells front desk via walkie talkie that the room is occupied a sheepish oh comes back after the situation is explained several times then we re given a new room number to try lrb try  rrb we head to the next room for our nd awkward breakin yes nd this time the latch lock keeps the door from fully opening but it s clearly occupied security mortified yells at walkie talkie man for sending us to occupied rooms we get a lame nonconfidenceinducing system went down for hrs excuse and are sent to the next option security goes into that room but comes back saying it s inappropriate he tries to quietly report this via walkie talkie but the front desk is nt getting it so he finally has to admit it has trash and um well toilet issues nice talkie squawks to try another we get to that door and now i m hanging back as the doors open but even i can readily see the air conditioner looks like it was sold for parts security reports that it s out of order he s mortified and apologizing it s not his fault but it does nt help we walk halls and ride elevators me lugging my luggage in an awkward mutual acknowledgement that whatever room we find is definitely costing me nothing finally an unoccupied suite amazing security disappears to check it out and is gone for quite a while i m wondering why but then he emerges and says he thinks it s ok lrb thinks  rrb i nervously enter and find this is actually a really great room big living room two bathrooms nice bedroom every light is on so i can see it s clean the tv is on too really loud that seems unnecessary since it s pushing am but i m grateful to have an unoccupied room so i say bye lrb do nt get excited there s more rrb security asks if i want the key now or in the morning i say now so he says he ll get it and put it on the table i say ok but after he leaves i realize that s weird because it means that he s just going to use his key to come in while i m sleeping flashes of the terrified woman from our first break in flood back oh heck no i turn off the blaring tv and sit in the bedroom to listen for his return and with tv off that s when i realize there is a dance party happening downstairs people laughing yelling music lrb  fml rrb i hear security return and drop the key on the table by the suite s front door i go lock up and do the mature thing  barricade the door with suitcases lrb i m blearyeyed and paranoid at this point and despite the noise going to crash in seconds rrb morning comes and i meet my colleagues for breakfast one has had no sleep because she was terrified that someone tried to break into her room lrb she was rm  and now i m wishing i had known so i could have just taken over her sofa rrb the only guy in our group lets us know that even men who wear pink shirts do not want to sleep in magenta rooms our other colleague is just listening intently while eating her oatmeal until she bites into a raw onion sigh the hotel did comp my room but unbelievably sent a snarky email after we checked out complaining about my colleague s room charges i think our bar tab got charged to the comped room really  a few drinks was the least this hotel could do
they bullshit you you know how they say you cant trust a mechanic well they said i needed dollars worth of repairs and didnt even perform all the services in the service i paid for lrb didnt check tire pressure etc rrb bunch of jerkoffs dont go there
this was our first and last time to liberty market we ordered the biscuits and gravy and a side of liberty potatoes it was a lot of food which my wife and i split we were impressed with the biscuits and gravy they were pretty good the liberty potatoes were very salty and greasy at the conclusion of eating the breakfast my wife took a look at her coke which came from the fountain more specifically she looked at the glass and there were bugs on the inside of the glass initially we thought that it was just a dirty glass we looked closer the bugs were alive and moving as we were examining the glass a waiter came by and asked if we had ants in our soda we looked closer and they were ants he apologized and took the glass and we saw him go over to the soda fountain to examine the soda nozzle i then took a closer look at the coke i was drinking ants yup they were in my glass too and i had already drank two glasses the waiter came back over and said that he was going to comp our meal i told him that it was in my glass too he apologized asked for the bill to go and comp our meal the problem was that while he was away another customer went to that same coke nozzle and filled up her glass he came back with the comp  ed meal we were disgusted a little queasy thanked him and left the problem was as we were discussing after we had left the restaurant the waiter seemed to already know what the problem was when he came up and asked if there was ants in the soda and the fact that even he found out that there were ants in our soda he did nothing to prevent the lady who filled up her drink from the same nozzle joe may be cool about insects crawling around on his food on the farm but they need to be kept out of the sugary soda
a little late to the party i was able to convince my father to get out of this house for what looked to be a great time and great food what a disaster the prior reviews are dead on we were so excited to savor the tastings of food trucks but obviously so was the entire population of scottsdale lines lasted for hours trucks ran out of food and everyone was grumpy not impressed
ok biltmore what is going on with your dwindling dining and shopping options lately  decided lrb mistakenly rrb to try this place but should have stuck to original plans of going to true food anyways the food and service really fell through here no water was offered no salt pepper no flavor nothing chipotle makes this place look authentic and star worthy the nachos had no toppings and the tacos no flavor just veggies on a tortilla after the food was thrown at us not even a chance to complain because we were nt even asked how it was the server dropped the check and did nt even offer to box what we did nt eat because obviously he knew what we were eating did nt satisfy yet did nt try to correct the situation i ll be spending my happy hours and lunches at true food stingray or hillstone while at the biltmore from now on fail
if you do nt mind waiting in line and then having car after car behind you go into the wash before you you ll be fine they appear to be group of unhappy workers that are actually trying to undermined the process and intentionally make customers mad unfortunately i have a prepaid card so i ve gotten to experience this a dozen times it s unpleasant to pay for a wash and always leave ticked off or to constantly tell them no others were here way before me fair is fair and their management needs to get out front and correct this problem
avoid at all costs i think their name is now xo nails they were unprofessional dirty and in then end i am not happy should of left before they started
so i m not trying to be funny when i say this but i wish i could have gave this place zero stars as far as the service it was nt that great but l i ll give them the benefit of the doubt since its new and they have teens working up front it was my first time going there so i wish she told me i could have a flavor crust she told the two people after me thou and one of them got there pizza before me not sure how that happen the pizza was nt good at all to be honest but large topping pizza you ca nt expect greatness but i do expect better then that now on to the philly cheesesteak hands down one of the worst cheesesteaks i ve had if not the worst i had the philly cheesesteak with grilled onions and cheese sauce there was not one good thing about it the bread was nasty and hard there was nt enough meat not sure if it was the cheese or the meat but it was was very salty its over priced also bucks for a in if was just want a cheap pizza and do nt care about taste i ll say got for it but do not waste your money on the philly cheesesteak
always a favorite spot last night the cantina laredo fajita s for four were charged as if for server could nt fix the bill then the meat was reheated cold meat since it was late it was a critically ill friends birthday  and i didnt not want to make a big deal  boycott
worst wendy s i ve ever been too went in over a year ago for breakfast special waited in line for minutes and then the order was all messed up long and short too many other good places out there do nt waste your time
as a vietnam combat veteran i went into this subway for my free sandwich on veterans day and ended up getting a ration of shi  i showed them my va photo id and they told me i could not get a free sandwich they said it was a for deal and i had to pay for one i told them that is not what subways corporate office said i have used this subway for several years but no more i will definitely tell all my former brothers in arms about this place i did get a sandwich at the subway on arizona ave just north of the target store without a big blast of grief this is where i will eat from now on
rancid smoked salmon ammoniated sea urchin and what seemed like a gallon of over reduced and scorched eel sauce on pretty much every roll ruined what i had heard from reliable sources was a good if not great restaurant i really want to try it again but i am honestly afraid to bummer
you ca nt put lipstick on a pig to make her pretty same goes for this walmart it might have been remodeled but the people they employ has not changed what a bunch of slackers my son and i stood at the bakery for a good mins while the ladies working there were looking through a book i said excuse me several times but was ignored we finally gave up went to the electronics department looking for printer ink and was completely ignored i was told by several associates they would be right back never came back made my way over to the clearance on christmas paper etc it was busy lrb duh rrb but there were associates pushing through people to stock merchandise on the shelves i get they need to restock but the shelves were full not to mention packed with people then they would sit there and huff and puff that they could nt get their job done finally get to the register lrb there were open the day after xmas rrb was able to pay fairly quickly considering the cashier was also a manager that was getting called away every seconds i hate this walmart and i would rather pay double somewhere else
less than zero  closes too early for a frequent traveler
never made it no signage no place to park too much of an effort went to cantina laredo on e frank lloyd wright blvd instead very good experience there
the last time i visited burke veterinary hospital was a few years ago but since i was reviewing vets i thought i would include this place anyways what stands out in my mind was the fact that the veterinarian seemed very aloof and almost arrogant that was enough to turn me away permanently
worst iced mocha i ve ever had about like a chocolate protein shake internet was down more than it was nt maybe i came on a bad day and maybe i picked a bad drink oh well just a starbucks wannabe shop for me
let me know when you people fix the goddamn airconditioning and i ll  consider  coming back for a second try it is an outrage that you dared to open this in augustseptember knew there was an ac problem lrb as evidenced by the comments of your staff when some in our party complained rrb and have still done nothing about it as of late september absolutely infuriating to walk into a place on a degree night only to find it feeling like inside i should ve listened to the game on the radio in my car when the waitress asked if there was anything else she could get for us i almost said yeah a shower 
ice cream was soft and not creamy like it used to be way over priced
i came to carolina s with high hopes i ve heard so much about the location downtown that when i heard there was a location in my area  i was stoked i ordered a burrito with beans cheese green chile and eggs i opened it to devour and the tortilla was so sopped with moisture that it completed fell apart i ate it as i could the potatoes tasted like the ones you get in the can the eggs were watery and the beans were nt there someone behind the counter charged me extra but failed to follow through i will say that their tortilla with butter is good  but what is nt good when drenched in butter for good tortillas go downtown to glendale and go to la purisima do nt waste your time with carolinas
i checked in here today and saw they had a coupon upon check in so i bought stuff and tried to pay for it and use the coupon the guy that checked us out said the coupon was bogus and that sports authority never put the coupon on he said that yelp put the coupon on the website without sports authority knowing seriously  crappy service and staff that clearly do nt know how to honor their own company coupons
i was not impressed mainly because the fruit toppings were lack luster what can i say  i m a topping snob the amount of variety does nt make up for the mediocrity of texture and flavor boo
greasy food meager side portions  freezing  over air conditioned environment and to top it all off rude employees you re lucky that we let you eat our food type of attitude no thanks there are just too many other burger places to choose from delux anyone  yum
no flavor and poor service would nt recommend
this place gets star because you ca nt give stars the appearance is nice at first glance but it is a hollow vision indeed the office staff smiles through their teeth they like you till it does nt get them anywhere the tenants are going downhill gangbangers lrb literally rrb actually live there the police are showing up there with more and more frequency and the  hot tub is little more than a hole in the ground lrb no actual heat rrb the saving grace is that the maintenance staff are actually genuinely nice people avoid it is going down hill quickly
with the internet as big as it is now how is gamestop still even in business  if you want to get ripped off on your tradespurchases on newused games then go ahead and come here it s scottsdale anything goes
this restaurant is not wheelchair accessible i have no idea how the food is because there are steps and no ramp
i do nt know what all the buzz is about with this place after seeing it on the news we gave it a try not impressed we tried the fish taco shrimp taco chicken taco and the quesadilla after all the reviews i d read i started to think we were in the wrong place whatever the lettucecabbage mix on the taco was was nasty and wilted the corn tortillas fell apart the flour tortillas were awesome though they screwed up our order served people that had just shown up and before people that were there before us wo nt be going there again
this has got to be the worst streets of ny in town i ordered mozzarella sticks and they not only looked disgusting but they tasted just as bad they were either extremely freezer burnt or the breading was not supposed to be on a mozzarella stick the pizza was jusok but not great the cheese ravioli with meat sauce looked like it had dog food for meat sauce i feel sick just thinking about what i just ate i think they just ruined streets of ny for me for life thanks a lot
although i am impressed with the herb store that is part of this establishment the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired let s start with the tables  chairs very tiny lrb like for children s tea parties rrb and rickety lrb although it adds to a sense of excitement and paranoia  to compliment the sense of inferiority they attempt to engender with their we will wait on you when we feel like it because we are more elightened about veganism than you treatment rrb a few of the items that interested my husband on the menu happened to be unavailable and apparently this is not ucommon at chakra according to some other reviews here i ordered the watermelon gespacho lrb sp  rrb which was very good their bread  toast is another matter it was very hard lrb think thin patio paver rrb although it was drenched in olive oil i broke the corner of my lower left tooth completely off lrb i think i must have swallowed it rrb when biting into it since i did nt realize it until about an hour after leaving the restaurant they would not refund the meal or offer to pay my resulting dental bill they have a very limited and uncooperative refund policy when it comes to having issues with their food i think the only way they would have refunded the meal was if i were accompanied by a camera team who filmed the entire meal and the broken tooth incident as well as a forensic team who could analyze the contents of my stomachbowels for the tooth chip and a cement engineer to test the hardness of their breadtoast versus that of my tooth which does nt seem cost effective at least i got my calcium when i swallowed my own tooth chip  i literally got my calcium if you have any old stale bread that you are considering throwing out or that has sat in the sun for a few days after accidentally being left on your back patio table following a meal outside by all means send it to chakra so they can then toast it then drizzle a little evoo on it and serve it to their customers  recycle people but do nt expect any sympathy or cooperation if you leave their restaurant with your smile looking like wilecoyote s after he accidentally missed the roadrunner and instead bit down on an acme metal plate
i wo nt eat bagels in phoenix so i am not here to review them i am only here to say that i had dinner there last night and the place is filthy the service awful at best the reuben sandwich small flat greasy not enough dressing the partitions between the booths are so high that you ca nt see a server and they ca nt see you i had to wave my napkin high over the wall to get noticed and it s not like there were any other customers to serve a complete waste of time and money
i swear the four assed monkey from south park is in charge of this place when you have customers in front of you waiting on a pizza that s been sitting here s a hint hang up the phone and deal with the people waiting to get their food we were there on the evening of may around pm first when we walked in there were two other customers sitting in the line waiting for someone to come to the counter and give them their food that took ten minutes then before the idiot behind the counter could tend to us she wandered off for another five minutes when she finally got back she took a phone call while running our card so we could get out of there this took a total of minutes that s madness the pizza is nt good enough to justify our wait wo nt be going back ppp should fire everyone who works here and start over bunch of half witted no whits
save your money and eat a hot dog while watching the game
fatty antibioticpumpedtokeepmealive stoodinmyownpoop  till  theyslaughteredme  feed lot  meat what is happening to this country s meat   sure on wing tuesdays they may be only each but the gristle fat and squish they call chicken is barely swallowable  beef ribs are little more than fat on a bone slathered with sweet sauce ick send it back  kitchen never on time when your server stops by to say your food is on its way that means at least more minutes  limited beer selection  bag salad mix sprinkled with bag shredded cheese and bag croutons ugh sure they sell their sauces in takehome bottles but if they re cutting corners so heavily on the meat just imagine what choices they re making in the sauces blech corporate quality gone amok
i had to take my mazda to this dealer after it broke down and my mechanic could nt access the car s computer that evening they called and told me about worth of repairs i needed to have done i surprised them by having my mechanic call to ask the details about the repairs it turns out none of these things were guaranteed to fix the car the car had started working on its own so i decided to pick it up and just pay the diagnostic fee i paid over the phone and they told me i could come by pm that night to pick it up  the service guys would still be there i got there at and no one was there i m sure others have had much worse experiences at car places than this but anyway there was really nothing positive about this place at all except there were free donuts in the office
you would think in north scottsdale an honest person could leave their sunglasses on the table by accident come back the next day they would have been saved by the waiter or the busboy not at salty s they are thieves not to mention the food is aweful and the staff could care less about service
this was the worst experience that i ve ever had with a refi run away as fast as you can we opted to not go with the va they offered us and wanted a conventional refi they tacked on fees that were in access of dollars at a rate and that is with excellent credit and they wo nt even give you true quotes unless you give them via credit card to start the process we ended up using dlj financial in california they were up front professional and did not require crazy fees our interest rate is way lower than what quicken quoted us and they responded to every email and phone call quickly i have no idea how they got rated  by jdpowers run away and use a different company
ate here once after hubby picked up different sandwiches and shakes sandwiches were good if you like your sandwich toasted this would be a good place to try but the shakes were bad really bad really really bad hubby noticed while waiting in line that a customer in the restaurant commented to a worker that she did not like her shake at all he did nt think anything about it maybe she just ordered a flavor she did nt like he brought the food home and we ate our sandwiches he tasted his shake first lrb oreo rrb and thought it had a strange flavor i thought maybe he did nt like it because of some innocuous reason lrb like they used an imitation brand instead of the actual oreo brand rrb i tasted his shake and agreed it was like an electrical taste like the shake had been forced through a burned out blender motor lrb i m not saying that s what happened but that s the best approximation of a taste description i could come up with definitely did not taste like any other food taste i could describe rrb still i thought it was maybe just the oreos lrb clearly i am biased against something so trashy rrb then i tasted my vanilla shake and it tasted like i just licked a burned out blender motor lrb again i ve never had to do that but that is the best approximation of taste that i can come up with rrb i love ice cream and i love shakes and never ever have i tasted anything like that in ice cream or shakes did not taste like a food item so maybe pot belly had just opened and maybe just maybe a blender motor had malfunctioned and we were willing to forgive if they would acknowledge an issue when my husband called to tell them lrb not to ask for a refund but merely to suggest that they should take a look at their equipment so nobody else has to suffer what we did rrb he could barely get a word in as the person on the phone was very quick to tell him how delicious and famous their shakes were hubby had the shakes frozen and was going to take them to a lab to get them tested i solved the problem by throwing them away and vowing never to go to pot belly again at any location
this review is exclusively for the t cook s lrb if it is part of t cook s rrb lounge area only as we did not stay in the hotel i do nt enjoy writing bad reviews however we feel that people need to hear about the experience we had here in summary we would not return due to their poor customer service and have shared the following experience w  our friends and family my husband thought it would be nice for us to go out and do something special before nye to help us decide if we should spend nye there he did a whole lot of internet research and found that according to the website the lounge area of this hotel had flamenco entertainment once a month he called to verify and to see if we needed reservations the woman who answered was quite nice he said and confirmed the start time of the entertainment how fun we thought we dressed for the occasion and were very excited to go to this lounge  we went wednesday december and arrived at pm the grounds are absolutely beautifulwe were even more excited as we were pointed towards the back area to the lounge first off we walked in there was no hostesshost no one to greet us  not knowing if we were in the right place we looked around and at that time a waitress lrb or maybe the bus girl  rrb practically ran past us clearly not wanting to be side tracked my husband asked her if this was the place where they had the flamenco entertainment and as she was walking awayrunning away she said that there was nt any flamenco there and pointed to the bar and told us to ask the bar supervisor my husband and i looked at each other wondering huh  so we both walked over to the bar where there was a bartender and one of the waitresses kathryn and i think another bar person we stood there waiting for them to agknowledge us which they did nt so after a few awkward seconds my husband asked them if this was the place etc truly we felt like we were interrupting their conversation  we felt at this point very unwelcome and it had nt even been minutes since we arrived we were pretty sure that we were in the wrong place and there s no flamenco entertainment here they all looked at each other to ask themselves is there flamenco entertainment here  one said no the other one had no idea and kathryn the waitress said that they did but that it would be outside all this while no one was speaking to us there were speaking amongst themselves we found this to be extremely rude impolite and uninviting i think my husband asked if food was served there kathryn at this point said yes and informed us that there was also a restaurant down the hall lrb tcooks rrb that served food we felt pretty uninvited there like she was shooing us away actually now that i think about it so we walked to tcooks and realized that we were nt in the mood for formal dining and returned grudgingly to the lounge we did nt get a  welcome back or any greeting that could turn the previous experience around but yet we decided to sit the waitress kathryn was dutifully pleasant while taking our order the hors dhoerves were good but i have to mention this when the bus girl  i did nt get her name served us the food not a word from her my husband politely said thank you as she served us the food and still not a word back from her she s the one that nearly ran us over  i noted her above all in all i m not sure what was going on w  their service staff i really feel they just did nt want to be there and secondly they have been inadequately trained in providing excellent customer service rude impolite unwelcoming and not knowledgeable about entertainment provided there definately not a place we will return tothat includes the resort we did not stay for the originally much anticipated flamenco entertainment which ended up being inside and not outside like were toldwe felt too unwelcomed
this place claims to be a punk rock bar it s not what i d consider a punk bar way to many rednecks this is not a cool place and the booking is god awful skip this place and head to the tt roadhouse hell even the rogue is better than this place
why offer reservations if you ca nt seat a party within minutes of their reservation time  at least the group that complained ahead of us was offered drinks all we got was are you sure  it should nt be but another or so minutes lrb we had offered to sit outside and there were a lot of empty tables outside shorthanded on a saturday night  rrb fortunately inca s peruvian restaurant in the same center saved the day lrb love the lomo saltado rrb
just had at souper salad last week and had bad experience i am a vegetarian and was horrified to find meat in my veggie soup i double checked and sign did say vegetarian i brought it to the notice of my server who did nothing but say i am not sure i didnt make it well now i know how they can afford a buffet by sacrificing on quality of food never gonna go there again
this location is closed drove by yesterday and there is a sign for station no 
avoid this place at all costs i wondered around this store tonight for minutes and not one employee could take the time to ask if i needed assistance i finally tracked down an employee and walked around back and forth looking confused just to see if she would ask if she could assist not a chance she went back to storing some blind hardward in one of the kitchen cupboard displays i finally approached her and asked a simple question  if they had an adapter for a range hood lrb since the range hoods were feet from where she was working i though just maybe she might know rrb i even showed her exactly what i needed from the display model she says i have no idea but if we do it would be over in venting i oh seems no one knows to which she snaps back in a snide rude and condesending manner i m sorry i do nt know this entire store wothless go elsewhere
i just recently moved here from texas and this is the first place i went to for an oil change the first time service was fine i expect people to attempt the upsale on items and they do that s their job however i expected the work to be done right for miles after the first change i ve had an oil leak the second miles the oil leak worsened and caused problems with my engine i went to them between that time and i was told oils full and no leaks were evident but the oil light kept coming on i checked myself and the leaks were both in evident spots with the oil filter being one later and a second opinion i m good to go i never comment on things like this but that shows me that they do nt care about taking care of your cars but more about the money spent upon visit
very dissapointing i went there last night with friends i waited for minutes without anyone seating us and then we waited another minutes at a table without anyone coming up to us even to give us menus we left i really hope this place gets their act together i live downtown and i want it to do well
way to go essence after a few awful experiences here you d think we would learn right  remember how i said i would never go back to eat here ever again  well this morning i did and i regret it long story short we stood in line ordered paid for two breakfast items and two iced soy lattes found a table and waited and waited and waited and waited as soon as i noticed a table of four who had come in significantly later than us being delivered food and enjoying their meal i was furious our drinks were gone and we had been sitting there for almost minutes my boyfriend went to the counter to ask them what was going on they did nt have our order surprised  i should nt have been essence and i just were nt meant to be it gets better we asked for the food to go since we live minutes away and we were sick of sitting there they brought out the food super fast which was a little concerning since our food had nt been made yet right  they were kind enough to load us up with some goodies but it did nt even matter because after our super short drive home we immediately opened our food from being super hungry and its was cold holy shit give me a break
after visiting this hip little place i ran away the sashimi was great but the slices were so big you literally had to cut them down to bit size pieces the rolls did nt even stay together  they were golf ball size in diameter to add insult i did nt even get everything i ordered i will never go back and i have no clue why everyone is giving them such high reviews
first the couple good parts the docs have always been nice and fairly competent unfortunately i ve had a different one every single time i ve been there so i do nt have any loyalty to them the technicians have been fine as well but the rest of the staff yikes they are incompetent and downright rude lrb they were talking crap about me other customers other employees in earshot of everyone rrb i tried explaining that the doctor told me i could go home call them and tell them the brand features etc i was already wearing and then they would finalize my prescription the lady i was passed off to then rrb pressured me to buy contacts from them rather than online and rrb when i refused proceeded to make it as difficult as possible for me to get contacts from anywhere else despite what the doc said she said that i had to come back for a trial pair because they did nt have any in stock lrb great rrb then i d have to come back a third time for a follow up ridiculous they did nt get the trials in for over a week i finally made it back in two weeks after that after more arguing i convinced them to let me have a follow up right there and then because i was already wearing the contacts i wanted and this time i brought the actual box and contact case with all the information so i did nt need the trial pair doc approved i grabbed my contacts lens rx and bounced i also needed new glasses but i was nt giving nationwide any more business so i went to a lenscrafters at lenscrafters they needed my eyeglass rx lrb nationwide had only given me a copy of the contact rx rrb so they called nationwide nationwide refused to turn over the prescription unless i faxed a release which of course took them a half hour the lady at lenscrafters was stunned she had never had to do that and did nt even have a release form because most places will just fax the prescription over no problem by the way you re not a nationwide chain so your name is stupid never again never again
service dept needs better management dropped of bike for saddle bag installation  waited days for update on it finally i called them after ride of about miles the bolts were loose overpriced bikes  poor service dept
the dr s seem okay but their billing department and office department is atrocious to say the least they will bill you for things that were already paid and then will continue to harass you to pay it and continue to increase it and add lots of on to it this is after you have already paid your bill in full during the appointment they will change the amounts and threaten and they will not discuss things reasonably they will just insist that you pay for their officeclerical errors read the reviews on other sites from past employees and you will hear the same thing from past employees as well as patients i would nt trust either location just based on their billing practices alone
unless you are a regular or look like your wallet is fat do nt expect the best service entrees cost about  bucks and anti pasta runs between  desserts are all bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar they also have a big cheese selection i made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door the waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal he did nt even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted the other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese lrb it comes with jelly s and such rrb my meal was good i had the duck she had the salmon which tasted very fishy not fresh at all the wine was bucks for a carafe lrb maybe if we would have got a dollar bottle we would have gotten better service rrb the dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce nothing too special overall the experience made the meal not worth the bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar if we dont want to give  do nt charge it plain and simple just a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing we mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager we received an apology but how bout comp our dessert or something hyatt gainey staff is also rude for the most part two thumbs way down
horrific service chimpanzees could make a sandwich and ring me up quicker
remind me never to drive thru here again if i checkin again  shoot me i m not a huge fan of sonic except i like their limeades and crushed ice i ve never been to this location before and i wo nt recommend it the service was fine the gentleman who took our order was patient and nice however whoever prepared the food did nt prepare it as we ordered it i asked for no mayo and got mayo that pretty much ruins the burger how can you take mayo off  yuck my daughter s chicken whatevers lrb bits  pieces  nuggets  rrb caused her to ask is this chicken  she s and not that picky so that must have been pretty bad i thought it interesting that the drive thru guy encouraged me to fill out the survey to be entered for a drawing for a free something or other why  because he did nt give my daughter any honey mustard sauce after he attentively asked how many packets she wanted i usually do nt fill out those surveys i may start now nice drivethru guy but absentminded lrb i suppose we all have those days rrb good slushes and limeade lrb this would be the only reason i d come back rrb bad food
much of their services do not provide any real relief to back pain the services involved a heat treatment with tens machine and then stretching by dr baca all of these things can be done at home and you save a copay he will try to get you on other services not needed to get more money into the practice he is one of very few that offer mui services but most insurance providers do not cover so proceed with caution as they will tell you its  covered the back office people are very non responsive atrocious in calling back when questions are asked for insurance coverage what they will tell you is that it is covered only to find out from your health care provider that triad never called bottomline do nt waste your timemoney on a service that does nothing when there are many more experienced chiroprators out there
rude management and office staff very slow response times from maintenance team lrb if they came at all rrb and ridiculous charges at moveout thankfully i was able to talk them out of the extra charges since they were based on nonsense the complete lack of help from the office staff leaky roof frequently shutoff water and bad termite problem made living here a total hassle the only redeeming quality was the lovely gainey neighborhood and close proximity to the hayden greenbelt no thanks never again and i do nt suggest you rent there either
saturday morning rush i m sure it happens every saturday as hordes of conventioneers grab breakfast before heading to the airport i understand a rush i am also a generally patient person lrb i am fine with waiting an hour or more for a table at good restaurants rrb but when there is a continuous line of people between the order station and the register half of whom already have their food and just want to hand over some money you call for a second cashier when you  are  the second cashier instead of walking out of the back looking around like punxsutawney phil on february and then crawling back into a hole you actually spend minutes clearing the line maybe dedicate someone to making all the coffee concoctions people order so you do nt have the one staffed register empty for minutes at a time it took me about minutes to get to the register by which time my bagel was getting cold i stood waiting for about minutes as employees dawdled at the prep station ignored the call for a second cashier plodded through coffee orders etc the last straw was when a woman from the back of the line came up and asked for two coffee cups and an approximation of the cost so she could just leave cash and the woman behind the counter lrb who was working on a fancy coffee order at the time rrb actually switched to the other register to ring her up i was done i picked up the register pen wrote nevermind on the order slip set my overpriced bagel and expensive orange juice on the counter and walked out lrb yeah einstein bros that was me rrb if you do nt want my money you are nt getting it instead i am at starbucks a couple blocks away my order  a bagel orange juice and a banana and all cost considerably less than what it would have at einstein bros
the chicken fingers are horrible the breading used is meant for egg rolls and such not to mention my extra soggie fries ewww
deceitful after visitng several tuxedo rental stores i chose carrillos because they offered great specials on prom tuxedo rentals i chose specific after six tuxedos and made sure my receipt was correct i placed two orders each on seperate dates they gave us generic jackets on both orders completely different to what was displayed and ordered
i just went by yesterday in hopes of finding the perfect little baby gift but the store looked closed permanently bummer
went here on an early sunday afternoon the place was empty but we were a large party of and got seated right away sadly we would ask for items and were told at least times sorry we re all out of how are you out of everything when you just opened and your restaurant is empty  my meal was ok the servers did not seem to know who ordered what and were giving people someone else s food someone ordered honey bbq wings and said that they tasted like they had been reheated if you had a dish that required a fork well you had to request silverware the servers just did not anticipate the guests needs and had to be prodded for everything i had to ask for a salad that i had ordered that never came out with my meal if i could give  stars i would will not be returning
i had previously been to switch and had a mediocre experience with their breakfast and cocktails this past saturday of my friends and i decided to give it a try before we passed judgement three of us order burgers medium rare with salad the burgers looked as though they were straight from package with grill lines already on them one of my friends picked up his burger to take a bite out of it and greased poured out of it the cesar dressing had to come from a bottle as the salad was definitely bag salad to add insult to injury our waiter was incompetent at best and had zero personality
i honestly do not know why this hotel has such a difficult time finding a decent restaurant the hotel is really a great boutique hotel but definitely go offpremises for food there s no need to regurgitate the other bad reviews but if you chose to go and actually have a nice time lrb in my experience that would be a in chance rrb then good for you but in an area where within a few mile radius you can eat infinitely better and for cheaper you might just be a nickenpoop and the restrooms have consistently been subpar just think if a restaurant ca nt keep a bathroom clean lrb which is very simple to do rrb what must their kitchen look like  but if you re in this for the weird status symbol stuff then go here and be seen it s one of the required spots for that sort of thing  at least once
this store is huge and has lots and lots of products i was happy to shop searching out their sale items until i was checking out they falsely advertise their sale items today i went to purchase their camp kids products that were on sale at  off as i was checking out they claimed that the paintable bobble heads were not included then they claimed the other camp kids products were not included as well all of the products that i had chosen was on the sale rack with the sale sign over it i specifically made sure i read the sale sign correctly and yet they refused to honor it i will never go back i do nt trust what they advertise if you choose to shop their better check your receipt
holy smokes the service is really slow if i had nt already paid i would have left almost missed my plane
could nt get to my regular salon lrb elite nails in gilbert rrb to get a fill lrb acrylic  pink and white rrb anyway this is on my way home and stopped in horrible job it was only a fill staff was not friendly tried to pay with a debit card and got shamed into paying cash lrb what i had rrb told the credit card charged them when i use my card a lesson learned but back to my regular place two thumbs down
the customer service is awful i would absolutely recommend going somewhere else for any and all prescription service i have had multiple problems here including them losing my refill i will never use any cvs location again and will recommend no one else use them either
sadly what i considered to be by far the best and most reliable bagel shop in the valley seems to just not care anymore the last several visits some bagels had the texture of not being boiled before they were baked the taste is now hitormiss as well the other day i was in the store and did nt recognize a single employee if they re having new people make the bagels they need to stop now several bialys were undercooked and oddtasting and again a few bagels were off in their texture as well as taste it s bad enough that business seems to have been nonexistent since the move to the new location you ca nt afford to screw up your main selling point i just ca nt recommend this place anymore for bagels
in our house this store is known as ghetto target my wife and i feel subservient to this store for geographic purposes we have come to know and ultimately endure our frequent shopping trips with continually lowered expectations of anything positive coming our way the checkout staff is to a person rude unprofessional and often seem just really really dumb my favorite story from ghetto target is a few months ago when i purchased some laundry detergent paper towels and a birthday card upon my exit a security guard followed me out of the store and asked to see my receipt for the purchase surprised i replied kindly no you ca nt but thanks for asking i kept walking to my car as the security guard ordered me to stop threatening to call police i calmly told him i was okay with his plan to call the cops got in my car and drove away with him standing in my rear view mirror looking like a complete idiot of course it s target so i still go back often maybe i ll get a tshirt that reads i survived ghetto target 
im from cali and this stuff they call thai food sucks
went for a pedicure and gel nails with one upgrade it was about  a bit pricey for the services the massage was also very light and very quick and probably does nt count as a massage the biggest downfall was that the tools and inside of the salon looked dirty i snapped a pic of the gel uv machine  super dirty on the outside and when i went to put my hand inside there was sticky stuff all over the inside of the machine i told the girl but she shrugged it off not clean  not cool
i hate to be the first bad review but my husband and i were really disappointed we got a slice of the hazelnut cake with mocha ganache filling and the old fashion vanilla bean cake both cakes were very dry and bland and lacked sweetness the icing was too sweet i do nt think i ll be back if i do i ll try something else like a cupcake or cookie as everyone else seemed to rave about
if you have nothing to really do and just want a basic lunch in a cozy environment i say go for it i dont know what the pie is so humble about its not that great with all the other choices for food in scottsdale i say look elsewhere for an interesting time
automatic  gratuity even increasing the credit card charge after the customer leaves is this true  httpwwwyelpcomtopicscottsdaleautomaticgratuityarewelegallyobligedtopayitifitsnotnotedonthemenu
overpriced nothing special or unique here better quality available at albertson s or safeway better pricing available at albertson s or safeway in another year or so the proliferation of yogurt  cupcake shops will end these franchises are a bad business investment the naive will soon learn to avoid fad businesses
gross the buffet was watery bland and lukewarm the only vegetables included potatoes and an occasional pea also two of the dishes tasted like velveeta definitely not worth
i used to come here all the time only because they dont have those brushes that beat your car up so i specifically asked them not to use the hand brush on the front of my car because they go so fast that the handle nicks the corners of my car so as i see my car going to the line up what do i see guys using brushes on my car so we confronted the lady and she proceeded to show us how soft the brush bristles are not my point but they were nice enough to comp us the wash then the guy wiping down our car was worthless from now on i m washing my car at home what happened los olivos 
you ll be disappointed very attractive restaurant belies terrible service and worse food preparation and presentation my advice  stay away there are lots better places in scottsdale and environs waiter started out by lauding the size of various salads entrees etc touted as very splitable we split the prawn risotto a dollop of risotto covered by prawns each that th prawn was an extra charge friends split the lasagne we all know what a slice of lasagne should look like the split portions were served in a cup the size of a small custard cup but each had a slice of bread attached to this sumptuous presentation the restaurant should have been embarrassed to have brought such a joke to the table a third friend sent her seared tuna entree back twice it was served ice cold each time they gave up and just took it off the bill the days of free dessert to atone for bad food and service are long gone this place is a culinary joke do nt waster your time and money you ll be disappointed
out of business
ummmm went in search for a hot dog today and stumbled apon two hippies food did not come out right and they dont accept anything but cash although the do have a convient little atm machine that charges like bucks to use  this place
strangest experience i ever in a restaurant should have had a clue when we walked up and doors were all wide open saving on ac second clue a sing stating we are having a soft opening lrb aka were going to screw everything up rrb they have been open a week already we got seated and they brought our drinks had to flag bus boy lrb aka superman he said rrb down to order appetizer got that it was very tasty but very skimpy ordered the roulade meat there could nt of been oz of meat on the plate finally ordered our meal i ordered the grilled chicken with peanut butter sauce pineapples and mushrooms served with vermicelli my wife ordered chicken pho supposed to be their specialty out came my soup for my entree it was tasty i got my chicken meal and it had rice on it i told them this is supposed to be vermicelli i was told it comes with either i was sure it did nt i asked for a menu and sure enough they gave me the wrong dish there was no pineapple mushrooms or peanut butter sauce it was a few pieces of dried out over cooked chicken i said to one of them this is not what i had ordered lrb superman rrb comes over to the table with a menu and says you ordered the roulade appetizer i said what does that have to do with my entree  he goes back up to the front counter to discuss it with the crowd of employees that were standing around finally a girl comes over and says we have two different chicken meals i said i know i pointed to this one finally server comes up and admits she put the wrong order in their excuse was we are having a soft opening just what i was afraid of i was getting full already so i told her there was nothing she could do she did nt act like she really did nt want to do anything i said just forget it i ate a few more bites of the salad and left pretty mush the entire meal my wives pho was flavorless broth with some pre cooked cut up chicken thrown in there no flavor at all a great big bowl with  noodles while we were eating a huge fly began buzzing around our table i told the bus boy and they finally closed the doors i was shocked when the bill came and my meal was still on there i was nt in the mood to argue the server apologized and said it was here first day it was like a gang of kids running the place all clueless it amazes me how someone can put thousands and thousands of dollars into a restaurant and have no clue what they are doing where the hell was the owner  good luck i give them months this place is a circus
update  if you have nt heard this place is now closed for business the clubhouse is hands down the worst music venue in arizona it is such a shame that some of the best groups book through here i m trying to figure out how the clubhouse gets them in the door in the first place i have literally skipped seeing bands that i love simply because they play here every time i cave and get a ticket for a band i think i ca nt miss i am beyond disappointed each time the sound is horrible as they have the bar located in the middle of the place so if you stand behind it to drink while you watch the show forget about hearing what the artists might be saying because all you hear are mumbled words not to mention if you are standing there trying to listen to the music all you truly here is the audience talking you have to stand dead center in front of the bar and stage in order to really enjoy the music but here it is in the dead of summer and you d think they would have an air conditioning system that actually worked  oh no it is a sauna in there and you are stuck in between hundreds of people all crammed in to this small space sweating smelling and sticking to the floor because it s like they never clean it the bar service is horrible to boot and way too expensive for such a dive seriously promoters should really think twice before booking a band at this hell hole i do nt like the bartenders attitudes but i will hand it to the security staff of all things they are the nicest bunch in there do not waste your money to see a band here maybe if people stop going they wo nt book as many great bands
delta airlines is one of the worst airlines out there my flight out of pvd was delayed sat on the runway for a good mins when we arrived in atl they forced all of the passengers to do planeside valet bc the overhead bins were smaller than normal so i had to wait another mins for my luggage these series of events caused me to miss my connecting flight to phx none of the delta representatives and managers cared there were no more flights out to phx that night and they were not willing to provide hotel accomodations andor a meal voucher so i was stuck in the atl airport overnight seriously one of the worst experiences ever and i fly a lot  if i could
run down so much tobacco smoke you can hardly breath walking down the hallways stains on the carpet and the chair no shampoo had to go across the street to the drug store to get some most hotels leave you a small bottle noisy there has to be something better than this place
terrible experience at rigatony s they made me feel like it was wrong of me to have an opinion on the food they served their food was nothing great customer service is absolutely horrendous would give stars if i could do not go to this restaurant there are plenty of better italian restaurants that will actually have delicious food and appreciate you treat you with the respect that you deserve your money should be spent on delicious food and quality service not at rigatony s
first a public service announcement tonkotsu  pork bone broth that is used as a ramen soup base tonkatsu  pork cutlet lrb breaded in panko rrb something you eat over rice thank you we now return to our regular opinionated review so you just saw tanpopo or ramen girl and wanted to try some ramen from a place that specializes in ramen to see what all the fuss was really about you come into this place order a bowl of miso ramen and patiently await your meal when the girl brings your ramen you close your eyes and imagine yourself in some quaint ramen shop somewhere in japan  bullet train in the distance enka playing from the shop s speakers you put the ramen broth to your lips and pppppppppppffffffffffffffffffffffftttttttttttttttt almost spit it all back into the bowl instantly you re back in tempe  light rail in the distance alternative rock blasting from the speakers the broth has not a molecule of miso flavor that your tongue can detect hell maruchan and top ramen have more flavor in their flavor packets than this sorry excuse for a broth anyway that s sorta what happened to me more or less came in with rather high expectations and had them shattered the moment i tasted the broth umm did i order the shoyu ramen by accident i wondered  if so miso silly if i did though there should be a stronger shoyu flavor the noodles themselves tasted ok there were some slices of char siu and they were passable  meaning they actually had a flavor that resembles char siu but still this place would nt even cut it as a hospital cafe in a bad part of tokyo reading some of the other reviews however i guess it can cut it in a strip mall in tempe on the south side of east university drive i d actually been here once before a while back and do nt even remember what i ordered  it was that good so i came back a second time just to make sure fool me once shame on you fool me twice miso stupid so i m still hoping for a real ramen place to open up in the valley someday yeah sure some japanese restaurants have ramen on their menu i mean an actual ramen shop that just serves ramen maybe yakisoba and udon as well but primarily ramen one can dream right 
the staff bait and switched me on the apartment they showed vs the one that was available for movein was told the mgr would contact me then lied about it pretending they did nt know what i was talking about when i brought it up was involved in too much else so dropped the issue but am paying the refurnished price or a nonrefurbished unit in addition though their online work ticket submission form allows a do not enter option they ignore it and will walk in on you lots of kids here but are pretty well behaved a few adults like to have skanky screaming matches in the wee hours
anyone staying at this hotel beware do not trust any information given by staff pertaining to metro rail schedules i gave the front desk four hours notice of my desire to see a late night movie i was assured that the light rail would operate until two am stupidly i believed that this person behaved in a professional manner and actually checked the light rail schedule wrong the light rail only ran until midnight i left a very polite detailed message for the manager did she bother to call me back and apologize on behalf of the hotel  no she then blamed her auditor she stated that she thought another manager had called me back here is a great professional idea for you if a guest leaves a voice mail in your personal mailbox it is your responsibility to call them back my personal safety was put at great risk with my assurance that i would have transportation after my movie concluded addendum i just got off the phone with a very concerned senior manager from the hyatt he is going to deeply investigate why i received such horrible customer service from his staff he is going to investigate why the on duty manager did not even bother to return my call he is very clear on the facts i appreciate his call and concern thank you
going to post every single day as a family man was disrespect and treated as garbage by management lrb tim rrb food came out min late in scottsdale and accused of being intoxicated after one budweiser and half a socki bomber charged us the full tab and when my daughter had a change of diaper a man in the bathroom was also rude and telling me to get outta the way while i was trying to but her diaper on while they have no family restrooms nor anything for her to lay on besides the floor will never go there again worst experience ever i hope the have cameras so i can pull the tape geezeee
my decided to go there in friday night the place was empty we arrived at and had to seat ourselves on the patio because the hostess was not there the waitresses outside who kept looking our way didnt bring us over a menu or take our drink orders until finally we got to order our drinks which never showed up finally at we decided to walk out with the economy how it is and with the amount of traffic there one would think they would be starving for our business that obviously wasnt the case
was hanging around desert ridge  decided to come here for lunch on a weekday i think this place used to be cadillac ranch but it seems all notorious did was put some red picnic plaid table clothes lrb which was all torn up where i was sitting rrb  a bottle of bbq sauce and open for biz what a waste of a nice restaurant space so we got the family platter that consisted of   rack of ribs lrb they said it was lion back ribs lrb aka babyback rrb but all we got was spareribs wtf rrb  pulled pork  brisket lrb bland  dry rrb  hot links lrb spicy  smokey  rrb  sides cole slaw lrb hard  under season rrb corn on the cob lrb soggy rrb  sweet potato fries lrb nothing special rrb i feel really bad for the one waitress running all over the place i did nt mind that she did nt have time to refill my drinks bc she was hostess waitress  cashier for the entire place even the cooks came out to help a little so sad
best margarita  whoa this place has a reputation that it does not deserve food is ordinary and inexpensive but the margaritas are overpriced and make no sense when the beer is so much cheaper here young stuck up millennial somethings hang out here and it is almost as if this place got transplanted off mill ave into scottsdale or maybe it s just the scottsdale asu kids that go here because they live close by in scottsdale with mommy and daddy can be loud with limited seating and parking is a pain here as well
ok i ve tried this place twice and i m not going back the food is food maybe i m just not the person for this place
well compared to everyone else i got a great person at the window she was not only kind and sweet but she made terrific conversation never met anyone as nice however the hot chocolate was terrible i mean bitter burnt gross and completely undrinkable how can you mess up hot chocolate  you have to try to get that wrong more over i asked for without whipped cream and got some anyways i hate that there was a particular reason i asked for without i would nt go out of my without reason also this is mainly a get your coffee and go type place only outdoor seating next to a large intersection not recommended for a relaxing place and my experience does nt mean all the batistas are as nice as this one individual seriously do nt bother with this place though the one on mill is far better
i do nt understand the reviews of the restaurant either we were on an off day or this restaurant wo nt last another days the food quality service management attentiveness was absolutley nonexistent some of the dishes could have been good if they were served hot and on time service was horrendously slow and several of the dishes were inedible the sea bass was extremely salty the moroccan chicken was cold and the medium rare lamb chops were well done we complained to the servers repeatedly and to the management with no positive results management appears brain dead they had two responses we re sorry to hear that and we re utilizing a new concept 
the good  the entree tasted good  the salsa was good the bad  went on a weeknight should have been no wait but waited at least minutes before someone even showed up to ask me how many people would be in my party this is of course in addition to someone standing behind the counter and completely ignoring me until somebody else showed up  waited over minutes to get drink orders  the chips were stale  the food was overpriced  the drinks were extremely overpriced  i got sick after eating there overall i d look elsewhere if you want good mexican food do nt waste your time with this place

no mas pollo went to this chuy s location for lunch today and it is closed note on the door regarding landlords rights never was a really happening location not sure what the other stores are up to but this location is done
i just would nt touch their food or drinks just to be safe
perhaps i ve ordered the wrong things or just have shown up on offdays during my  visits to oe but i ve left wholly unimpressed on every occasion the cheddar jalapeo biscuits and gravy were nt worth finishing  punctuated by the taste of raw flour in the dry particle boardlike consistency of the biscuits and the thin and relatively gravy topping them this was a let down since biscuits  gravy are one of my favorite dishes of all the country benedict was another dish i d ordered during a subsequent visit and also was let down by this comes with a cheddar jalapeo biscuit as well so i purposely ordered it to see if the same taste described above was present it was dry raw flour particle boardlike biscuit again to add to the frustration this country benedict was topped with two nearly solidyolked poached eggs i think anyone ordering eggs benedict expects yolks to spill out  drizzle  meld with the hollandaise sauce upon cutting into them these just sat there like soft boiled eggs cut in half covering the eggs was a hollandaise sauce that tasted highly acidic  more like a mustard or lemon bite to it than the smooth rich and decadent hollandaise i was accustomed to perhaps the hollandaise was  right according to oe standards but i did nt enjoy it in any way rounding this out was sausage patties which tasted fine and tater tots as my potato side i can deal with one miscue in an eggs benedict dish but three fullon miscues  eggs done wrong highly acidic hollandaise dryraw flour tasting bread  nope the pork and potato side should not be the highlight of a benedict ever i ate slightly more than half before i pushed my plate away and decided to speak to the manager about my meal and to express my disappointment he kindly removed the entree from my bill and i paid for my oe iced coffee and left about a  tip that oe ice coffee is the one redeeming factor  i do love that drink add consistently grungy dirty table tops and slow lrb but competent rrb service to the disappointing dishes i ve had on every visit and i simply have zero interest in returning i gave em or college tries to get it right but it s obvious that oe simply is nt the place for me
no surprise the place is gone
my god this walmart is like a place in the seventh level of hell there is no way to describe how horrible it feels to come here first off the customer service is awful the employees are dumb as dirt and half of them are clearly retarded or tweakers checkout is super slow and a lot of times they will not open a new line to speed things up second they are always out of different things in the grocery section and they are super slow to restock third the customers here are like a mutant breed from another world you get tweakers degenerates welfare queens and their worthless stoner baby daddies and every other low brow asshole from mesa on another note avoid coming here at night because they stack boxes everywhere to create a labyrinth to keep you trapped in their shithole grocery section the worst part is walmart will never need to change anything here because there will always be disgusting pieces of shit that will come here and spend spend spend avoid at all costs go to the one on southern and rural they are usually less crowded
i was there tonight i thought to myself when i saw it this place is really cute after being there one hour i went back to my car to get something only to find that my car was nt there they had towed it i parked in the back part of the lot and apparently it was not a spot however there were no signs or anything telling customers the tow truck kept making rounds to tow customers cars coach house must be getting a kick back for every car that is towed what a scam on top of all of this the manager is receiving my complaint with a cigarette handing from her mouth all she said was you have a good point what a poor display of customer service they want you to come in and spend money yet tow your car i have an idea einstein put cones or mark off the places customers are not allowed to park then you wo nt get reviews like this one good riddance i will never step foot in that place again
horrible customer service they are either not payig attention and rush or talking on their cell phones while doing your nails there are way better nail shops close by who actually care about the customer
wow what a letdown to start service was not very good nobody seemed to be in charge waiter was not attentive i ordered granola healthcakes with blueberries and strawberries my gosh could you be a little stingier with the fruit  they sprinkled the tiniest handful of fruit on top so little that there was nt nearly enough for a little fruit in every bite more of a suggestion of fruit than fruit itself the granola is obviously not made in house  it s very industrial  uniform uniformly tasteless nuggets the menu says pancakes are served with maple syrup and honey butter not so maple syrup is nt even available it s just pancake syrup ewww i suspect the honey butter likewise is nt real butter but probably margarine ewww breakfast potatoes allegedly made from fresh were just okay definitely will not return
i m hoping that someone at the health department reads this and is as alarmed as i am about what i witnessed at bluburger last night i was sitting at the bar and ordered a cheeseburger with no addons  so no lettuce tomato any of that jazz literally within three minutes of placing my order the bartender put a plate in front of me surprised by the speed but not thinking much of it i ate a couple of sweet potato fries then noticed that my burger was awfully dressed up i lifted the bun up with fingers i just wiped my runny nose with lrb i know i m totally gross but i thought it was my food rrb and saw that it was not what i ordered at the very same time the bartender came hurrying back saying she accidentally gave me someone else s order as she whisked it away i explained that she d have to make it over again because i already touched it and i have a cold she kind of laughed and brought the plate back to the kitchen window i watched while the cook did nothing more than put the big toothpick back into to bun and sent the contaminated plate out to the unsuspecting diner i do nt know if the bartender did nt tell the cook what i said about already touching it and having a cold or if neither of them cared what i do know however is that is really really gross and if i knew that i was eating someone else s snot germs i d barf so if you ate at bluburger last night and you develop a cold this weekend now you know why
after waiting for over an hour lrb also with little kids rrb i finally get my spicy chicken pasta and the noodles are hard this is nt what i would expect after waiting so long at this point i have no desire of waiting for them to bring me a new plate they did nt even offer to take it off the bill there are tons of places to choose in this area i m not sure i will ever go back
i m not sold i m not sure what the hype is and i do nt think i ever will and you know i am not going to apologize for it i ordered traditional buttermilk pancakes thought i d see how they would do a classic without much fuss well i got em they were fine but not spectacular the reason for the low stars was a lot due to the lack of spectacular but also due to the the sup par customer service our waitress was inconsistent another waitress was grumpy even though she was not our waitress i could feel her grumpy from afar she would walk by grumbling about how people were still walking in to eat at pm lrb they close at pm rrb but what topped it off for me was seeing her fill salt shakers one was a little too full so she put her fingers into the salt shaker grabbed some out of it and threw it on the floor without blinking i thought maybe it was just a thing she did but still filled other salt shakers without doing this  what bothered me is that i had to put salt on my hash browns it left a rather stale taste in my mouth her attitude tone and overall demeanor was just not welcoming wo nt be back for  beverage  plates of pancakes  plate of hash browns  side of bacon lrb for slices rrb
this place is a typical greasy spoon mostly previously frozen costco junk food yuk
breach of contract i contracted with az pro signs on  for a carbon fiber wrap of my rear bumper with a year warranty for vertical surfaces and year for horizontal surfaces i paid for this contract i took my car back to them in july with a defect in the rear bumper wrap i offered to pay jason p for the work jason said that he did not like the way i looked would take money for repair and did not want me to come back to his shop again another company reviewed the az pro signs work said it was substandard quality and would have to strip the entire rear bumper and start from scratch if i wanted a warranty because i no longer have a warranty from az pro signs i want a complete refund of to have the job done right by another shop
i do nt know where all those people who have given them  stars rating we went in there for the st time from san diego where they know how to make mexican food we waited mins before being waited on and served the food was less then mediocre at best and the service is below average st and last time there
this restaurant is out of business i was really disappointed
took forever to get a salad we think he forgot our chicken parmesan arrived obviously microwaved food was indelible we did not see a manager to express our displeasure
there was hair in the food not just but in the same bhel puri dish the whole experience was pretty bad there is no indication of how you order your food and when you finally figure it out the food does not taste good we checked sodas on the order sheet and when no sodas showed up we asked if we were supposed to go and find our own sodas from the front of the store and were told that that was the case also the guy at the counter is down right dismissive pani puri was ok papdi chaat  boring no flavor bhel puri  boring and no flavor before we found the hairs not worth the trip
cox is pitiful after the rd receiver broke and i went back down to get another one they actually blamed it s failure on me i think their equipment is absolute garbage and they will not give you a new unit but only beat up used refurbished crap that breaks also the user interface for the box is slow and always freezes try dish network or directv ps you should see what the installation guy did to my house i had to have them send another guy to come and fix the walls and redo all of the wiring lol good luck
even if you had reservations for a week in advance and your table is minutes late never ask for a single thing at binkleys the owner will cuss you out not serve you and kick you out while still making you pay for small plates of food last time i checked at the  star restaurants i have frequented in paris chicago dc dublin rome london new york san francisco los angeles barcelona and madrid this would be considered abusive and slanderous what a shame that a man has to treat customers like this you never know who you are serving and word of mouth spreads fast among high power doctors and business people mr binkley let me know when you get your michelin rating because i m sure that will never happen as superior customer service is a main requirement
if there was such a thing as zero stars  this place would be it a friend a i went for restaurant week and the food was nothing to ever go back to we had the crab cakes which i am surprised they can even get away with calling it that  more like fried crab and mayonnaise balls then we had both had a chili and coffee rubbed scallops they cut the scallops in half to make it look like more dunked them in a oil bath and then poured coffee grinds and chili paste all over mmm yummy the best part of the meal comes with the check they neglected to tell us that after a month of being in business they still have not connect their american express machine when we went to pay the server said ohh we ca nt take that yet to which my friend and i argued that we should have been notified ahead of time what if we have nothing else to pay with  the conversation gets so ridiculous that the manager comes over and tells us it s not his fault and there is nothing he can do so i will have to pay for the entire meal with cash or another credit card i told my servers to tell each table he said i m pretty sure that s not a good enough explanation i am sparing you tons of heated details the bottom line is i give this place months tops and it will be donzo
this is a very mixed review for me i had a great experience shopping at sleep america the salesman was low pressure and quite friendly i made a mattress selection and after the days i still had nt had a full nights sleep thankfully they offer a sleep guarantee and i was able to take the sleepless mattress back and go back to tempurpedic i now rest easily on my king size piece of heaven why only one star  i used their  financing for months option in which sleep america has an arrangement with citifinancial services i can only say this if you re not paying cash or using your own credit stay away citifinancial services will not send you contract documents and say that you got them the will hit you with fees and late fees even when you pay on their website before it s due and when you call to dispute it you get someone from a foreign country who does nt have a firm grasp of the english language therefore they do nt understand that if you make a payment before your due date that it is not late i m going to pay this off right now and be done with citifinancial for good at least i ll be able to sleep good at night knowing i did the right thing and that i got a great mattress for a fair price
awful why am i waiting minutes for a bagel everyone should cross the and got to big city bagels they have friendly fast service support local business owners einstein s made me wait minutes and then they gave me the wrong bagel i blame the owner
i m so frustrated with the horrible customer service at this location picture this customers in line behind me mr glen is a terrible representative of the us postal service his demeaning attitude not only to me but to several people there were several seniors inline that just accept his attitude he speaks in a down grading manner your not ready move over there til you are but sir i have a question mr glen mover over there lrb my question had to do with the boxes i was sending my sons in afghanistan rrb i will not allow anyone to treat me or anyone else like he just did not anymore he laks courtesy does nt say thank you come again nothing we support the post office wonder why post office s around the country may be closing it might have something to do with the attitude like mr glen and the like of him then the other teller also a man lrb didnt get his name as i was so frustrated rrb again while i m dealing with mr glen with or so customer s in line was playing around with a couple of boxes that a post office lady came up behind you and asked him if that what he was doing could wait till customers were gone all in all this locations needs major customer service help i ve come here often since it s close to my home i will return and repost and talk to others while in line
stale stale chips stale beer lrb clean the hoses rrb the salsa had a weird taste to it grilled chicken strips were rubbery the ranch was good it was that thousandcalorie restaurant ranch that you ca nt buy in stores i liked that
two hot girls walk up to the front door after a group of guys walk in the doorman says do you have a table  fuck you it s a w in scottsdale az are you serious  i would nt pay for a table in the w in nyc but you let a whole sausage party in  great door guys
yuk poor food and even worse service
i m usually a fan of cheesecake factory i ve been going since i was a kid it s usually consistent this trip however was very different appetizer lrb spinach artichoke cheese dip rrb was good my little ones grilled cheese was fine but our chicken chipotle pasta was terrible the flavor was fine but the pasta was nt even near cooked all the way after we sent it away the manager said that their pasta machine was acting up why are they making pasta if the cooker is broken  can they not make pasta in an old school pot with water  i did nt ask for anything else we ordered a key lime cheesecake to go and went home the cheesecake was the best part of our meal
guys what happened  i ordered a burger and fries for lunch yesterday and the burger was nt just bad it was disgusting the meat tasted off  i was kind of afraid that it was spoiled then it was raw inside and the bun had a rancid grease smell to it i m not sure if it was the oil that was brushed on the bun to grill it or if the grill was so dirty that the rancid smell transferred from grill to bun but either way it was just nasty i could only get through a couple bites of the burger before i tossed the enitre thing for lunch totally down the drain i was so disappointed the italian beef i had last time was just ok and after this burger experience i will most likely not be back
it sucks that yelp wo nt let me give this dump less than one star do not do not do not waste your time at this bar nobody goes to this bar there might be people there when a band plays but if there is no band the bar is a ghost town the bar could be cool but there are like owners who have no business running a bar go into the bar on a friday night and you will know what i mean the main owner must have deep pockets to keep funneling money into this waste zone give up and let somebody else make a good bar in that location stop over charging for drinks it does nt take a college grad to figure out lower drink prices and hot waitresses bring in paying customers
i found this place painfully disappointing i have heard others praise it but it so boring the food lacks imagination and complexity when we arrived the mood lighting was so low that we could not see the menus  we actually had to hold them up to catch the light  we joked about it at the time but it was very annoying i ordered a vegetarian burrito and found an abundance of beans and cheese accompanied by about tsp of avocado and a dash of salsa it was not in any way worth the money in addition my friend ordered surf and turf and got small shrimp and a small steak i mean really the guy paid for the meal they could have at least given measly shrimp on the positive side the building is pretty and they do give you a dessert if it s your birthday i m not usually very critical but this place needs an honest critique do nt go to this mucho over priced bistro 
yuck i have no idea why people go to this icky over priced chain restaurant
out of business not surprising they have been going down hill for years
customer service was horrible they lost a sale because the guy behind the counter was a dick
this place has actually been closed for a while it was nice while it lasted
the ideal customer for this store is someone who is heavily armed and who has the patience of ghandi you would need both to safely navigate the waters of this disastrous store this is the nearest grocer for downtown residents and it is sad that this store misses the mark by such a huge margin on any day the parking lot is covered in grease coffee and trash if by some miracle you are able to get inside without being hit up for money by tweakers then the heavens are smiling on you once inside the store your adventure is just starting the characters inside the store are the inspiration for the bar scene in star wars very random and sketchy as far as the contents of the store to be fair they have all the stuff you need and at a reasonable price point the huge problem here is everything else during peak hours they have very few lanes open that is a consistent failure with this store customer service is also dead here and they just do nt know how to take care of customers i feel as though the broken window theory is at play here it seems like because they do nt take care of the parking lot and other details the whole place goes to hell the store also has a serious shoplifting problem i m not sure if they just do nt staff the loss prevention unit or if they are inept but i have seen at least four episodes where a cashier is confronting a thief it makes for an unsafe situation for everyone they do have private security there and the guys seem really nice but clearly in over their heads at this point the store is so far gone they really need offduty police officers to make it safe it really seems like this store just does nt give a shit at each opportunity to impress the complete opposite happens this place is a huge safety problem and i would hate to have my sisters or mom go to this place it s really that shady see for yourself but be on your toes
i ve been to cyclo twice the first time was great the food and service was really good pretty reasonably priced really loved the fact that you could bring your own wine went back about a year later again food was great the garlic green beans as good as i remember pretty good service the owner was there again in another cute little dress lrb sorry but i notice that kind of shit rrb liked the check holders had customer graffiti all over them lrb more dumb shit i notice rrb finished the wine and meal hit up the bathroom before leaving only one and it was occupied fine it s a small place i understand wait a bit then our spiky haired waiter comes out he gives me a shifty look which i did nt understand i immediately get it once i make my way in and look at the toilet did nt even put the seat up piss everywhere i was so mad unfortunately the bill was paid and he was tipped by the time i came out f n disgusting i hate to judge the place by one waiter but feel like if they are gonna let this ahole work here ca nt help but think what else they might be letting slide sorry wo nt be back
am i the only one who was totally disappointed with this place  i am a huge frozen yogurt fan i ve been driving out to yogurtland in scottsdale for my fro yo but was excited about the new place lrb zen zen rrb opening up down the street tried it out tonight all i can say is yuck i guess i was spoiled with my yogurtland zen zen was clean yes but the selection was nothing like what was advertised on the website when i finally did decide on just plain chocolate and vanilla i was even more disappointed to find the frozen yogurt runny  not a consistency i m used it was way overpriced too i usually pack my cup at yogurtland and rarely break i spent tonight on just over half of a bowl needless to say i ll be making the drive out to yogurtland in the future lrb
food was excellent as was the service but as a couple we would never go there again because there were only two of us we were seat along a banco and had to endure every word spoken by our neighbors on both sides not a fun way to spend a  evening
this walmart is sad had a tire asst manager not return my tire caps and the scream at me had a cust rep call me a liar and i ve bought meat there twice and both times it was rancid never once did a manager return my calls after calling  wakmart avoid this store at all costs
dear macayo s i would like to thank you for renewing my hatred for your bland artery busting meximerican food i had nt experienced your brand of deep fried crap since i came of majority and stopped dined out with the family at restaurants that specialized in satisfying even the blandest of palettes i must say you continue to exceed my wildest expectations in that respect i had to continue looking down at my plate just to make sure the  calories i was consuming were more than just a mirage of mexican food i will admit that i have a long standing simmering hatred for you macayo s so maybe this biases my opinion a bit i ca nt in my right mind fathom why i thought you deserved a second chance last night i think it s testament to the fact that sometimes i make super stupid decisions on an empty stomach especially when i m hungry enough to eat the ass end out of week dead burro i suppose i was expecting something a bit more appetizing than that stretch of hyperbole how wrong i was your patio was the highlight of the evening it s backed up against a lake and there was a duck that watched me eat he had a shiny green head it was nice i made him my zen when all i wanted to do was lash out in frustration over the meal if i could offer a suggestion to benefit both the duck and myself perhaps you could pipe some music out onto the patio because listening to suzie and sally suburb bitch about their waistlines while committing refried sin was pretty grating the food however far outshone those cackling soccer moms in terms of annoyance i do nt know who you think you are macayo s but charging  bucks an entree at your establishment just about gave me a heart attack long before the lard had a chance to bully up on my arteries maybe it s because i think you have the street value of a gum job from a run down whore but i have to say that those prices were shocking i could travel the valley over and find better mexican food for much cheaper for that price i expect outstanding quality and taste or at least a hip see and be seen environment all you have is a duck working in your favor i do have a serious question for you though what s with smothering your entrees in cream cheese and trying to pass it off as baja sauce  it was the same jalapeno spread i get on my bagel in the morning but with even less heat and flavor i suggest renaming it manhattan sauce in honor of the bagel and schmear capital of the nation and i think it would be a touching homage to the pace picante new york city  commercials i also ca nt understand why the majority of your entrees offer either rice or beans but few have these in conjunction those are universal standards at a mexican food joint and the ultimate test of quality since they re comparable the valley over do they bring you shame  is that why you do nt want to offer them both  or are you just a cheap nickel and diming motherfucker macayo s  i m more apt to believe the latter because you charged me two bucks for guacamole without informing me that it cost extra then you delivered a pile of gelatinous green goop of questionable origin that had absolutely zero flavor by this point in the meal i really should nt have been surprised at how bland everything was because i was on to your ploy of substituting flavor for gobs of cream cheese and a heavy hand with the salt shaker but despite stiff competition from the bland pico de gallo and the puzzling baja sauce it was the shitamole took the grad prize of suckdom for the evening i have never tasted weaker guac you must have used some terrible avocados and whipped them with corn syrup or some other foodlike filler there was nt a zing of cilantro or lemon juice no hint of serrano spiciness not even the tang of some onion although i did see a couple soggy tomatoes bits added for color i do nt think i will ever be coming back macayo s it s not you it s i ca nt lie  even to spare your feelings it s you it s all you i m breaking up in a public setting because i m scared that you ll key my car while by back is turned or at the least smother it in cream cheese i know you re into that freaky shit wishing you deep fried broken dreams erica
this place was grosser than gross when we walked in the store had the most foul smell lrb cleaning products  fungi  mystery rrb which should have been an immediate reason to walk out but my mom and i got some yogurt anyway hoping it would redeem the trip it was not more than minutes after consuming the stuff that i was expelling it from my digestive system sorry for the graphic description but i figured it should be said i ll stick with mojo yogurt and never ever go back to orange leaf
we ate at rico s for dinner on sunday night by far the worst service we have ever had from the surly hostess to having to ask the waitress for our drink orders food service was extremely slow waitress even messed up the food order it was recommended by the concierge at the pointe hilton he should be ashamed for recommending it
this place is just aweful if you find yourself walking by and are tempted just keep walking it is simply not worth the trouble the manager could care less and was busy flirting with the cute girls the bartender was clueless dare i say stupid slow unorganized our food arrive minutes after we ordered and we were not the only ones i hope they reopen sam s cafe in its place in a few months i am sure stingray will not be there long
this place makes me hate mexican food everything is fried bland and gross do nt expect to leave without adding  calories to your daily diet i know that other people have raved about their beer happy hours this place is right off mill ave there are better happy hours and better beers all around mill this place is the mcdonald s in the ghetto version of a mexican restaurant
beware of the minute clinic paid copay and bought in over the counter drugs because they told me i had a bad head cold a week later and a visit to an actual doctor and they said i had a sinus infection ear infection and pink eye i told them about my minute clinic experience and they laughed and said they see people all the time getting awful care from clinics like this total waste of time and money
i d seriously rather have a big mac than this burger not worth it
had to stop here for connecting flight coming from cancun after customs u have to physically get ur luggage lrb the one u checkedin rrb from the carousel then check it again for your connecting flight the problem i encountered was going to security again to go to the gate for my connecting flight the security specifically shouted to everybody that we need to take out all liquid we brought and place it on top of our bags as it entered into the scanner this caused so much hassle because i didnt expect they demand such a thing i fly a lot and this was the first time they demand such of course since i didnt know the specific liquid lrb mouthwash rrb was at the bottom of my bag and i have to remove all my stuff out of the bag to get it urgghhhh
do not get nails done here service was horrible no music just a children s movie on because the nail techs niece was there i m from nyc and the nail ladies go out of they re way to pick up your purse and shoes since your hands have fresh polish on them did nt thank me for the tip did nt have black nail polish  who does nt have black nail polish  it had been missing for weeks she said hello buy a new one the nail tech was nasty and had way too much attitude like i was taking up her time quality me and my friends nails made it two days did nt even last a week horrible painting job i had to ask her a couple times to go back over spots she missed her foot massage was like a top of the foot rub that she kept doing over and over in the same direction pretty much just rubbing the lotion in price plus tip for all that mess i will never go back here and i hope you do nt either that would never fly in new york city oh well guess that s what you get for mall nails
after reading the great reviews about this place some friends and i decided to try it the food was awful i m not sure if it was an off night but no one at our table enjoyed anything we ordered we ordered the mac  cheese which was dry the steak sandwich had some weird sweet sauce on it the trilogy of bruschetta was really strange it was pieces of toast one had cream cheese and jelly on it  the roasted chicken sandwich tasted like fruit loops the only thing that was remotely edible was the simple salad on the flip side our server was really sweet the drinks were great and the atmosphere was nice i d come back but only for drinks avoid the menu
moved here  water mysteriously flowed through bedroom ceiling and came pouring out of master bath air vent no resolution they said rain goes weird places five maintenance men later guest bedroom wall and carpet soaked  garden level concrete not sealed no one even came out no maintenance  guest bath ceiling leaks two gallons of water a day  black green  mold seeping through the paint on the bathroom wall they said the water was coming from the upstairs bathtub but they had to order the silicone  my upstairs neighbors had to tell me what they told them drywall falling through open hole in ceiling  raul his crew broke a sprinkler line outside flooding my guest bedroom with six inches of mud andy mc companies scheduled this when he was out of town so there was no one to move anything i have rrms it is sunday this happened at friday morning it is eight maintenance staff later or more raul refused to give me his contractors license number as did andy hernandez i do not believe he has a license there were three guys who spoke only spanish bailing the water out of the outside ditch with a bucket one bucket i have picture of all of this and will upload after i clean up more sludge  office staff had not even been to my apartment by the time i drove home from work to see the mud office staff clears work orders once issued no follow through maggie told me to call terry he would help me with my insurance claim as my daughter shoes purses and dresser were damaged turns out terry is a she and out of the office until late next week leslie brice vp of residential has no idea what is going on over here
kinda gross that the cook had his hair loose also the nachos were nt all that flavorful def not worth
i had a friend in town and we were looking for a nearby pizza place for carryout i had nt ever been to hungry howies so decided to give this place a try and after the one time i think i m done the service was poor  a few high school aged kids that required me to repeat myself several times to get the order straight and took minutes to run a credit card through the register the pizza itself was terrible as well we opted for the original crust lrb they have flavors like parmasean cheese and garlic rrb it was a panstyle crust but was hard as a rock it might have required a trip to the dentist for a chipped tooth if i had tried any harder to bite into it if you re looking for carryout try rosatis
our visit sounded more like a visit to the emergency room there was plenty of sneezing wheezing itching and overall difficulty breathing the cause a clueless couple and their hairy cat a supervisor was called and we were told that we could leave the area but that a paying customer would not be asked to leave even if their cat was having a negative impact on other guests and employees pets are allowed personally if i knew that i had an item that was causing that much distress i would leave but i am of a different generation and it is not always about me so united  if i could give you negative stars to risk the well being of that many people i would
lots of hype for a burger smashed into its foil wrapper and drowned in ketchup  mustard fries are soggy and flavorless staff was very nice however
this place is not a star hotel as they try to state they are we paid a night expecting to have a nice experience at what is supposed to be a guest only water park the park was just like any other public water park there was absolutely no place to sit and the chairs if you could find one were cheap with cheap towels we never even made it to our room as we checked out as soon as we experienced the pool btw we found out that they constantly run special pricing cutting room rates to about a night this is why the water park is packed and for those of us that expect to receive star a night hotel service will be out of luck at this hotel might be worth it if you get one of their cheap deals
i m utterly terrified of this store i opt to drive a few miles to frys instead
if i could give this place zero stars i would i am going to california next weekend and was told to try roscoes chicken and waffles that sounded like a good idea to me and i thought i should try a chicken and waffles place here in phoenix and compare well i found off da hook and thought it sounded pretty good so off i went sadly i will never know if this place is good or not when i walked in the place was pretty full with a few people sitting on the little couch in front of the area where you pay i stood for a second then asked the people on the couch if they had ordered already this is when then wheels came off the guy sitting on the couch was rude when he told me they had already ordered i thought i would wait a sec for the guy standing at the register to finish before i went up to place my to go order when he left i walked up and waited for the person to come back and take my order as i stood there i looked around the place and saw a very large employee looking at me after a minute or so he walked over to me and said why dont you have a seat and someone will take your order i said no problem and mentioned it was a to go order he looked at me and very rudely said yah thats fine just sit down and we will be with you in a minute i then sat down and the asshole stepped behind me about a foot and started talking to the people sitting on the couch he sat there and very loudly started insulting me telling the people on the couch how stupid i was for standing in front of the register to place a to go order he was no more than a foot away from me while he was doing this this is nothing but disgusting behavior no way in hell am i every going to let anyone to treat me in this manor i stood up and walked out this guy is a pig and nothing but do not go to this place for anything or any reason on the way to this dump i drove by chikarib just down the street so i went there instead the people there were incredibly nice and bent over backwards to help me while i was there i ordered the chicken and waffles with onion rings and mac n cheese there food was fantastic if you want chicken this is the place to go not where the rude assholes work
the food was fair at best the variety of dishes left a lot to be desired the sushi was mediocre it s better at fry s the restrooms were unpleasant my year old was afraid to use the bathroom it was not worth driving over from surprise
really bad customer service grouchy employees we had a coupon for a discount on services and my husband had to argue with them in order for them to honor it i ve been in a couple of times and the older man who works there acted as if he was doing me a tremendous favor by waiting on me the lady who works there told me that the closest place to send fedex was at tatum and shea well there is a place right across the street on the nw corner of street and shea called ship and post lrb they handle both fedex and ups rrb my husband and i own our own business and we will be using ship and post from now on the fellow there is very friendly and efficient too bad ups store we were using you for most of our business needs

thou shalt not covet thy neighbors server i was so guilty of this as i sat there looking for my server i watched the super server who had what seemed like the entire restaurant as her station it seemed like every employee in the restaurant checked on me except my server if i waited for her to bring me some more iced tea i would still be looking no silerware no smile no how is your burger no thanks for coming in i felt like she was an exgirlfriend i ran into at some bar somewhere no eye contact minimal conversation every thing was just really tense food was a little disappointing the bun was soggy and the paddy just fell apart the presentation looked like it was a tossed hamburger everything just kind of landed on the plate on the plus side the ice was cold and i got billed the correct amount lrb eventually rrb do nt think i will be back
walked in took a while for them to get my order they did nt greet me they took forever to get the order ready and when they repeated the order back they got it wrong would not come back here again everyone spoke spanish no one spoke english really sucks

okay im pissed i have been going to the breakfast club for at least years and sometimes they are busy lrb more like almost all the time rrb and sometimes they are pretty fast about seating me i have always considered it my favorite breakfast spot in arizona lrb which isnt really saying much considering the selection rrb the food is good the service is generally fine and the prices are good but all of that changed this last sunday i got up decided i was craving chocolate chip pancakes lrb which they make quite nicely rrb and so i got dressed and got in the car called this place and attempted to place an order for pick up my house is about ten minutes from tbc so i figured perfect amount of time well it went down like this attempt  me hi id like to place a to go order please person okay hold on instead of putting me on hold the unbelievably incompetent girl just set the phone down and chit chatted and gossiped with her co worker and then proceeded to hang up on me five minutes later okaaaaay attempt  lrb at this point im not happy rrb me hello i am trying to place a to go order but last time instead of putting me on hold you just set the phone down and i had to listen to you talk for minutes before you hung up on me can you please let me place my order  person uh yeah hold on after which i am put the hell on hold again while dumb scottsdale server person  says like oh my gawd i cannnot waaaaittt to see this girl when she comes to pick up her food hahaha juicycouture edhardy blegh and then the phone is hung up attempt  i am raging hard at this point call call is rejected attempt  i am about to kill everyone on the road with my rage call call is rejected again at this point i am right around the corner from this establishment so i park march in to the to go counterbarista bar and immediately ask the man when it became their store policy to be so unbelievably rude and incompetent when dealing with customers he just looks at me like the dumb droid he is can barely even speak because honestly he just doesnt care i am so mad right now that i want to cry but instead i order my pancakes he gives me my soy latte for free to make up for my troubles i guess too bad it was the worst soy latte ive ever had in my life ever worse than starbucks all the other stupid waitresses are sneaking glances at me like im the crazy rabid monkey in the zoo and they arent quite sure what i may do all of this effectively ruined my day and after years i will not be returning to the breakfast club horrible service horrible human beings horrible experience they lost an otherwise very loyal customer that brought all their friends and out of towners absolutely awful oh and to top it off when i called later to speak to the manager it turns out she was one of the horribly rude phone girls and she wasnt even ashamed or apologetic for how dreadful they all were scottsdale forever proving the incompetence of its people
we went to the shimogamo for the first time on friday night a dour man who appeared to be the manager approached us and said we have no more space not a greeting not offer of a wait time not anything but no more space we left without having an food because we were definitely not welcome  more of an inconvenience the manager
delux is overrated i ve had a better burger at red robin seriously fez has better fez burgers and sweet potato fries i wo nt be back here it s just overrated and frankly boring my mom s burgers are better than this place
multiple issues from time of check in until check out i called to make the reservation i was considering a different hotel but chose the fiesta specifically because i was told breakfast was included with the room rate upon check in i was told breakfast was not included the front desk receptionist was rude and offputting i asked to speak to the manager she went behind a partition and came back out and told me that the manager said breakfast was nt included the manager would nt even come out to talk to me i got my key and went to my room i headed out about minutes later and had the shuttle driver drop me at my destination when my husband and i were ready to go back to the hotel we called for the van i got into the van but he wanted to stay a little bit longer at the bar so i asked the shuttle driver to drop me at the hotel then go back to the same corner to pick up my husband he said he would i texted this information to my husband assuming he would be back at the hotel within about an hour i was sitting in the lobby texting him and a large woman that i assume worked for the hotel came up to me aggressively and asked are we expecting any problems tonight  i was taken aback by her aggressive tone and stance i just said uh no and this scared me enough to head to my room and wait for my husband to get there i fell asleep within about minutes and woke in the morning to find that he was still not in the room i checked my phone and had missed calls and voicemails from him but my phone was on vibrate so i did nt hear it ring and it did nt wake me up apparently the driver never went back to get him so my husband ended up taking a cab to the hotel when he got to the hotel he asked for the room number and was told that it would nt be given to him the room was in my name and i was the one who checked in and had the room key my husband explained the situation and was still told that he could not have the room number i do understand the security reasons behind this and i respect that protocol however why would nt the hotel staff simply call my room to verify that my husband was allow to have access  or have the security person come to my room and knock on the door to ask me  i do not understand why they would nt do this especially given that the drive knew i was waiting for my husband and i gave no indication to the security guard that there was a safety or security issue end result is that they literally kicked him out of the hotel they would not give him my room number nor would they try to accommodate him other than calling him a cab the cab ride home cost us over simply infuriating i plan to post this review on many review sites and i will make sure word of mouth gets out as well about the unprofessional and aggressive attitude of the staff i m outraged we were treated like second class citizens something needs to change or i expect your resort will likely be closing soon
i ve been to cityscape three times in the past month and have yet to experience anything remotely worth praising the first time i went was with my girlfriend to check out the lucky strike bowling alley for the monthly mixer radiate phx i had already heard about the alley s dress code but i do nt wear baggy clothes sweat pants or sports logos so that was nt a big deal the problem we had was finding the entrance after parking in the underground garage we took the closest set of stairs up to the plazamallcourtyard we ended up on the north side facing washington just next to the new artbentpaperclip sculpture knowing in advanced that lucky strike was on the southwest corner we walked down st ave to where the cvs drug store is located we could clearly see the lucky strike signage but not the entrance in what was hilariously reminiscent of a scene from  this is spinal tap we spent the next minutes trying every door hallway elevator and stairwell trying to figure out how to get into the place turns out there is no way to enter the nd floor from jefferson whisky tango foxtrot  i m a big fan of architecture lrb no seriously last year i went to new york just to go on a walking tour with taliesin students i have dreams about calatrava s work i consider will bruder frank henry  michael p johnson my hometown heroes rrb so of course i started to really analyze cityscape after a few minutes i could see that place has no distinction and was not built to human scale its actually got less soul than tempe marketplace desert ridge and west gate this place is not designed to serve those who call downtown phoenix home its obviously designed to appeal to all of the suburbanites who think fauxdobes and tuscan mcmansions are awesome so many people assume that if you criticize cityscape you are somehow in favor of what was there before bullshit most sane people agree that patriot s square park lrb  rrb was a flop and eyesore the most often complaint is that is was a haven for the homeless so did cityscape somehow make all these homeless people have homes or better yet just disappear  no they simply displaced them into another area of town just like all gentrification does so do nt give them credit for making the place better especially when we lost a public park in the process back to the bowling alley we eventually made it up the escalator and entered lucky strike we entered what was mostly a hard rock hotel las vegas atmosphere that was filled with conventioneers lrb six sigma trainees specifically rrb the irony of original sheperd fairey prints hanging in a place that enforces a dress code did not escape us we met up with the rest of the radiate phx crowd in a private sectioned off area we were offered various appetizers to sample the chips and salsa were completely of the store bought variety this is arizona do nt do that shit the other appetizers were a joke typical sysco or shamrock foods frozen crap the beers on tap at our bar  bud bud light and stella have they never heard of the roosevelt  i just now realized how much i typed about my first visit which was actually the best time i had i ll spare you the other stories for another day
i purchase a groupon for for hours of window cleaning i called to schedule on  the girl that answered asked when i wanted the job done i said as long as it was before thanksgiving i was good that was days from now she said she did nt think she could get me in by then and asked when my groupon expired expiration is  she said she could get me in days before the expiration if i wanted to use my groupon she said as an alternative she could get me in at regular price less  if i did nt want the promo rate on my groupon she said she would even apply the i paid for the groupon to the regular price she wanted to charge wow what a scam i said maybe i should call groupon and tell them about this she said groupon is real good about giving refunds and maybe i should do that i have never seen a company put out and offer and so blatantly not honor it this company has zero integrity and does not deserve your business i am a huge supporter of small business as a small business owner myself and it was not an easy decision to write this negative review but what right is right and this whole interaction with this company was wrong please find someone else to clean your windows or power wash your home
horrible service and experience went to this edible arrangements to get my friend a birthday bouquet it says online and on their location s door that they close at pm on saturdays i arrived at pm to pick up my bouquet and the place was closed  door locked no one inside and no note on the door or on their phone recording explaining why needless to say i went to my friend s birthday event emptyhanded and will never return to this edible arrangements
its a mcdonalds
i ve had the worst experience at this wendy s i could do a long rant but i ll make this short rrb my year old was served a raw cheeseburger they walked this cow right through the damn kitchen rrb only one employee seemed to speak enough english for me to attempt to complain rrb the only thing i was given in compensation was a free kiddie frosty the manager lrb wherever they were hiding rrb did nt even come out to apologize the employees were too busy doing a chant for obama than to worry about actually doing there jobs while i do nt care who they wanted for president it s a bit disturbing that this was okay with management if my son gets sick i promise you that compensation will not be just a frosty i ve worked near here for over years and it used to be good but it has really gone downhill over the years
i visited the spa in september i went for the happy hour service which was a massage for do nt be fooled there was nothing happy about this visit this place must be hard up for money if you want them to use oil it was more if you want a scent added to the oil or generic lotion it was more if you want firm pressure it was more i m not kidding i m all too familiar with the addons these days i ve been to the airport and i m happy to pay for a seat that reclines lrb sarcasm rrb but seriously people this is a spa a place for relaxation and no stress to complete the afternoon the person at the checkout lrb catherine rrb was a total rag catherine why are you looking at me like i m white trash because i m tipping  on the price  oh you think i should tip on the regular price of even though this is a special i m sorry since when do you decide how well my treatment was performed and how much the tip should be  nice try just sliding it in there like i m not going to notice and one more thing paying with anything other than a credit card or making a purchase in the boutique will only prolong the checkout process i was paying with cash and nobody knew what to do it was like i gave them a travelers cheque or something the rest of the spa was nicely appointed in comfortable amenities equivalent to any star resort
walked and we were seated quickly hostess seemed a little put out as i looked around the restaurant i had not visited since the space was occupied by native new yorker we sat and sat for well over ten minutes with no further acknowledgement from the staff the place was not busy it was early in the evening after another ten minutes of waiting we walked out what a shame i guess it is spinatto s pizza for dinner instead
i give it zero stars my girlfriend gives it negative stars the service was the worst we have ever had in our history of eating the atmosphere is horrible we do enjoy other native new yorker restuants but this one is no good
i had never been to rainforest cafe and i m glad that i got to try it because i love trying things at least once  however this will also be my last time going there we ll start from the beginning the atmosphere was nice for the jungle but it was so loud that i could not hear my wife talking to me i felt that i had to scream at her to talk our waitress was nice but did nt check on us often we barely understood her either because she speak loud enough we got our drinks lrb ten mins later rrb and my iced tea was good but my wife s chocolate shake was gross too much chocolate syrup and it was expensive we sent it back so she could get water another mins later food delivery was quick and my burger was pretty good but it was plain and jeez so expensive for something so plain i got onion rings for an extra few dollars lrb they were okay but worth the extra few rrb my wife got an extra plate of fries and they were a few bucks but they did nt give her more than ten i like the atmosphere of the restaurant and the theme but they are completely over priced not worth it at all the food was mediocre but left me sick that night not as amazing as i thought it would be after seeing it many times in vegas
worst experience ever we came here for lunch on st patrick s day  had the unluck of the irish by having a clueless server it took minutes for our food to arrive given they were very busy she should have known after minutes that something was wrong we tried to be very patient and waited and waited and waited the table next to us were vacated and the next group came in and got their food while we were still being patient and was waiting for our food then the table to the other side of us was once again vacated and two men sat down at this time i decided to check my iphone as i had checked into yelp right after we placed our order and noticed that it had been more than minutes since meanwhile i was starting to really get hungry and started to get clammy shaky and started sweating i grabbed our server and told her that i was nt feeling too good because i was too hungry my sugar level was really low and asked for orange juice or a piece of bread she came back with a side order of fries to tide us over as the kitchen was still working on our order one of us told her to check and see that maybe our order was misplaced in the pipeline she said that she was really trying and that the kitchen was just too busy this was hard to fathom as the restaurant had a set menu of about items suddenly the table with the two men got served they ordered fish and chips and started eating and still no food for our table we had ordered two orders of fish and chips and salads how long does it take to prepare this  we once again asked the waitress where our food was and asked her how the the two men got served before us when they came way after we did same answer anyways the food finally came and we were starving we ate she brought us the bill no apologies no remorse etc we paid the bill in full even gave her a  tip i would be very skeptical about the skeptical chymist
oh my restaurant week this meal was a disaster terrible service totally non existent service no beverages offered and we had to ask for them there was a minute wait for a reserved table whilst empty tables needed to be cleared food incredibly lacking in flavor lobster was not served it was langoustine steaks mediochre to be kind excessively salty salad could not eat it pecan pie smothered in caramel sauce honestly good pie ruined one waiter hummed loudly for the entire evening he was nt part of the entertainment will never waste money there again so many great restaurants in town this is not one of them
i will never eat here again i do nt recommend any one eat here
horrible unpleasant staff food is bland and over cooked stay away
such a huge disappointment made lunch plans with a coworker today who suggested we try it out since we liked the grind lrb next door same owner rrb the place was empty at on a friday glad it was nt crowded but it could have been a sign of things to come we had a pleasant waiter who seemed excited to see us we started out by ordering the stuffed biscuit bites because the description seemed great chorizo manchengo cheese garlic cream sauce and herbs we were told it was taken off the menu because it did nt really taste very good so we decided to try the fried pickle chips instead i ordered a pulled pork sandwich with a side of chips and my friend ordered the pulled chicken and a side salad let s start with the fried pickle chips they were terribly sour dill slices cut way to thick with the batter sliding off each one just dreadful when the sandwiches arrived we were taken aback by how little meat was on each one at we could have used a few more ounces it was probably less than oz of meat the barbecue chicken was flavorless and oddly textured the pulled pork was slightly better but very bland they were both pretty dismal luckily our waiter brought over some madison s habenaero sauce by a local bottler it is very tangy mildly hot and a bit sweet if it were nt for this the sandwiches would have been left uneaten
guy in drive thru has indian accent from hell and they do nt carry ranch this jack sucks
we have been going to richardson s for years even before the fire we were looking forward to the reopening have been there several times since but last night s experience was horrible service was poor would nt recork wine we bought food marginal seemed to be understaffed manager said they went through a major house cleaning a month ago and new staff are not all trained so we wasted for people to train their staff  manager offered apology and suggested we come back in a couple of months fat chance
went to this place with a laptop of mine after it crashed and had troubles with my back up laptop there was some girl who worked there  plump and with black hair she was nt rude or unfriendly but she was nt friendly either kind of one of those people there for a paycheck  so she answers my questions and then i head out well a couple days later i went back because my back up crashed and some guy greeted me this time when just after she comes strolling out again just indifferent you would think that once a customer made it known that hey it s me from the other day how you doing the employee would somewhat match the enthusiasm guess not so then she just walks to the back and the other guy helped me he told me that the laptop would cost more to fix than it was worth so i left i went to u break we fix it and they quoted me at bucks to reinstall windows which is all it needed and i told that guy that but it still would cost me more than it was worth not just that these people wan bucks just to diagnose the problem and then if you choose to have it repaired the dollars goes toward the repair u break it we fix it will look at it for free if that is nt enough to sway your choice not sure what is for what would have cost me over dollars i got fixed for
this place is straight up creepy and run down last time i went all the gd insignia was gone and the menu seriously said restaurant name to be determined or something equally as ludicrous avoid at all costs the menu is subpar the service is crappy and the decor is about two decades out of date
i was thoroughly unimpressed with this venue for many reasons it took minutes to obtain a tasty beverage lrb beer rrb and about as long for glasses of water lrb the restaurant was not even  full rrb the waiter strolled by with his faux hawk to take our order about minutes later when the food finally came a member of our party found something mysterious in her burger we displayed mysterious item mentioned in  to said faux hawk and he appropriately took the plate away however did not omit the vulgar item from the bill until we explicitly asked bottom line the grilled salad i had was good but not good enough to warrant a second trip to cook n jacks or a recommendation to anyone
so disappointed i have eaten grimaldi s a few times and it has been amazing i just usually avoid it because i feel it is too expensive so today lrb new years rrb my favorite pizza place was closed so i decided to call grimaldi s since it is only a mile away from my house the pizza was done quite fast however it look completely disgusting the cheese looked like it was like wannabe feta idk what was going on the pizza literally was tasteless and i was nt going to smother it with parmesan cheese and crushes red peppers for taste i most likely will not come back shame shame shame
what happened to this place  the pizza used to be good but last few visits the crust was tasteless
i knew this place had poor reviews before yelp was even around but was in the area in search of food i improvised and went to one of the first places nearby i ordered a combo that was pieces of fish shrimp fries and a drink came out to just under for price comparison the same thing at long john silver would be  the shrimp were flat out awful they butterfly the shrimp to make it look bigger and then overload it with heavy batter before frying it i removed one of the shrimp from the breading and noticed it was probably times smaller than the amount of batter used they use realllllly small shrimp like  ct used in cheap shrimp cocktail platters at the grocery store the fries are below average if you are going to have chips in your name you need to have some of the best fries around they do not their fish was okay because it was nt overly greasy but again their breading is so thick and heavy it ruins it fried fish should have a light batter in fact nothing should ever be fried in the batter they use to top it off their fish is served in the most natural of shapes a square if i want awkward looking fish i ll head to the frozen section and get some fish sticks i saved the worst for part of the meal for last their signature sauce that stuff was awful it tasted like it was  water and  ketchup and  vinegar they do nt give you any tartar sauce no malt vinegar and nickel and dime you for sauces on the menu i figured some other staples for this type of meal would be included but i was wrong i did nt even get to drown the bad food in a decent sauce it was just more mediocrity on to the most obvious quirk about the place cash only if you are a cash only joint i assume you are trying to save the fees associated with accepting them and keeping your prices down then why is the food so expensive  it certainly is nt high quality it certainly is nt any good bad fish  bad shrimp  bad sauce  bad fries  star
i am writing corporate this is the worst kfc location ever if someone from corporate came to this location and tasted the garbage this location puts out it would be shut down
this michaels is the foundation of my theory that some chains stay in business despite the reality that shoppers loathe them because there s no adequate substitute it s the only source of craft supplies that s handy while running errands in central phoenix and it s near one of the movie theaters that serves real food so i shop here occasionally and i always leave crabby every section is tiny and understocked if something at another michaels catches your eye but you postpone buying it and you figure oh you ll pick it up at this one because you re here no you wo nt wood trim wood embellishments specific acrylic paint colors specific scrapbook paper designs the edgiest floral items forget it this michaels will not carry that the staff will explain with varying levels of chagrin that this is the smallest michaels in the region that much is obvious it s so small that it s impossible for two carts to pass in most aisles the major reason to set foot in this store is that you re desperate for tacky glue and ca nt face the chaos of walmart it has so far not found an excuse to stop carrying tacky glue there was also a moment of hope when the chain introduced martha stewart acrylic paints which are at least interesting colors but i d really like to know whose bright idea it was that chainwide acrylic paints should now be displayed entirely below knee level let me give you a hint gentlemen the tiny bottles of exotic colors are not bought by children nor is there a gigantic acrylicpainting movement among munchkins your acrylic paint buyers are adults which means we re mostly over feet tall and depending how the day went and how high of heels we re wearing our urge to indulge in a series of deep knee bends can vary a lot but it s rarely a matter of oh great i m going to michaels so i can skip the squats at the gym 
the service was slow server was nice but had trouble recommending anything we order the potato cakes as an appetizer very bland the server agreed we both ordered burgers on the sourdough bread it was mostly bread they did nt put the sauce on mine but did on his they said they would be medium well my husbands was medium rare while mine was well done the flavor was good considering the size one could get a better bigger burger cooked right at carl s jr the manager did come over and comped the appetizer when we mention that there was too much bread and not enough meat all she could say was they did nt center the burger right after showing her it could fit on one slice of bread cut in half she says yes that s just how we do it really  you ca nt just use a different size bread  or flatten the burger  oh hey how about not putting it on the menu not worth the money
this review is nt so much about the food as is it is about shady practices and lack of customer service being from nyc i m very biased when it comes to chinese food admittedly joyful is better than all the other chinese restaurants i ve tried here in the scottsdale the shady practices come in when i placed an order to go total seems there credit card swipe machine was broken and had to make an impression by hand ok no problem order was filled i signed the receipt for the two days later i go to my bank to withdraw money and check balances to my surprise joyful took the liberty of charging me i ll cut to the chase joyful denied charging me this amount even as i showed them my bank statement and had them speak to an associate from bofa days to clear up by stopping payment filling out reams of paper work etc a nightmare that could have been handled easily by joyful by looking at the factschecking them and refunding my they ve lost a customer unfortunate because it took me a year to find adequate chinese here in az the search begins anew
went there on a moderately light and hot weekend to get the kids something cool to drink and some ice cream they did nt have anything nor any dessert we did nt get anything to eat service was alright for the amount of time we were there being that this is a pretty busy marina i would think you would want to keep people out there and enjoying things it was not exactly cool inside the restaurant and no real drink specials other than on a few beers nothing to write home about here either i will not be driving out to eat here anytime soon nor feel like paying a fee at the gate to get in when i was already over at scorpion bay eating there and had to pay a separate so you restaurant managers and owners might want to think about comping that fee if people order a certain amount at the restaurant it would make it worth it to everyone and people would want to do it
this is the one of the most overrated place in town the vegetarian sandwhich is terrible i ve given it three chances i tried it while i was drunk i tried it for lunch on a weekday and on a weekend afternoon the bread is horrendous and the flavor combination is far too random people who do nt care about good bread might like it the bread is terrible it s like fat wonder bread i do like their drink specials i think they stay in business because u of a alums like to reminisce about their days in tucson
i preface this by stating i am half vietnamese and almost every weekend i have pho at my father s home nothing beats a homemade bowl of this beautiful broth and i must admit that because i am spoiled with authenticity i tend to be a harsher critic at the same time however i do give most vietnamese restaurants some slack if you want good pho do not go to dragonfly in tempe please please please their bowl of pho is incredibly small and they skimp majorly on the aromatics talk about a pho foul and what s with the shredded roastlike meat  oh no it s supposed to be circle wafers of rare beef instead visit the dragonfly in mesa that place rocks and they have other authentic soups that the tempe location does not have like the great soup mi  that s eggnoodlewonton heaven the egg rolls are not good at either location by the way if you know the difference between vietnamese egg rolls or chai gois and the fat cabbage filled chinese egg roll then you can imagine how disappointed i was when they brought me some egg roll hybrid with a gross sweet and sour sauce i m glad to see a vietnamese place on campus regardless and if others love it more power to them and i hope it keeps good little ethnic places like dragonfly open just know that there is way better out there
we love fat burger the food is miles better than innout and usually this is a really fun chain to eat at but we have completely given up on this location for one reason and one reason only the employees need customer service training one occasion we showed up minutes before the sign said they closed and they rushed to the door  told us they were closed next trip we walked in and the girl behind the counter who takes orders was sitting on the counter lrb no customers in store at the time rrb chatting with the cook and took her sweet ass time getting over to the cash wrap to take our order despite looking right at us when we walked in and when she finally saunter over she said not a word just stood there glaring at us waiting for us to say something normally this location lrb unless really busy rrb brings your food to your table when its ready on the last several trips despite being the only folks in the place the cook waves his spatula at you  says ready while same lazy cashier girl sits on her ass it s no wonder this location never has any customers any more we take the extra time  effort to go to the desert ridge location instead now i wonder why the management of this location has nt wised up yet clearly hisher business is suffering  its all due to the shitty attitude of the employees
this place blows and not in a good way thursday evening right before a baseball game there were people drinking and eating outside and insude the places was pretty busy how bad could it be  ugghh the server was wearing last years skinny shorts and was muffin topping out of them all over the place she never refilled water only came back after motioning to her recommended shit food i am a burger snob so i ask before i order if the burgers are good fresh not frozen can be cooked to med rare answers were yes they are excellent yes hand pattied and fresh yes but only to meduim so i get the burgers and frys the frys were good lrb got that out of the way rrb problems with the burger worst burger i have ever had fresh yesterday because it was a premade and cooked then placed in a juice of somesort regrilled on a flat op and burnt on one side only it had zero flavor and was  mushy  burnt was cooked all the way through like a freakin meatloaf it was so bad i added salt times and pepper times i still needed something to taste so i added the chili peppers from the pizza needless to say they took it off the bill the other items we had was a philly and there was about  the meat it should have pizza slice was day old and rubbery the drinks were served in cheap plastic cups like you get at a free drink special night in a nasty strip club or something they were waek as shit too blah i would have been happier with a drink and hot dog at the ball park
three strikes your out portlands an employee threw his dirty apron only a few feet from my plate as i sat at the bar i should have never came back the nd visit i arrived at and was told they were closing soon and couldn  st seat me as i go back into my car i saw two get seated i called and complained i was given a comp for two and went for lunch the fish we ordered was still frozen inside i will never step foot in portlands again lrb unless i have to pee during first friday rrb
tried to get my oil change and tires rotated on my truck here today but i decided against it because apparently one of their jacks is broken that means that they only have one jack which is being used all the time which means that its probably about to break as well it s definitely not going to be my truck that falls to the ground when this jack breaks i also went to another jiffy lube near by on apache and mcclintock same story
i was walking in old town waiting for my hair appointment later in the afternoon i was looking for the mandala tea room but found the picnic company first there were about police motorcycles out front and i figured they knew what was up food wise in the area i felt rushed from the second i walked in the door the employees looked like they were in a hurry and i felt pressured to order fast i quickly glanced at the menu not wanting to get a sandwich i decided on the sedona salad for the salad was slapped down on the pickup counter and when i got up there it was the most unappealing thrown together mess i ve ever seen at any establishment that calls itself a restaurant first it was extremely small second the spinach feta nuts and red onions were all just thrown on there as though it went through some fast food assembly line the vinaigrette tasted bottled i could have made a more presentable salad that tasted better with produce from fry s that cost me less than a dollar who knows how their sandwiches are i m sure they re decent considering all the cops in there i wo nt be back to find out i was so hungry after eating this sorry excuse for a salad i walked over to the mandala tea room and ate another meal ugh
almost as bad as oakland constant gate changes lrb and the terminals are not anywhere close to each other rrb we flew there headed to puerto vallarta and our gate changed twice  from b to a and then back to b fortunately there was a long layover on the way back it changed twice in b and then to a  we almost did nt make our flight security takes forever they pull over the single brown man to double check his bag they allow first class passengers to bypass the security line holding everyone else up then they allow people in wheelchairs to bypass the line lrb which is very understandable but why do they only have two xray lines open  rrb there are tons of grouchy older people there i like old people but the grouchentitlement level was comperable to dulles people are freaking rude it is not the friendliest airport anywhere  unless you compare it to oakland compared to oakland it s not so bad but i still wo nt be flying through phoenix again
worst food in and that includes food trucks and fast food it looked like an old place that had been around a long time and i usually have good luck with places like that  not htis time i had the samon fillet which was extremely dry and tasteless  i have had beef jerky with a higher moisture content  the best thing on my plate were the soggy unseasoned canned greenbeans my wife got the liver and onions and no one was able to eat two bites  dry gritty horrible one of my sons had the fried shrimp special and that was the only ok plate lrb and the only one in the family that actually finished his dinner rrb  it was just typical deep fried shrimp from a bag of frozen but at least it was not scr  wed up i noticed that there were many more people in the bar than the dining section so the drinks may be ok but i will never try the food again
never again the shipping is so overinflated it s offensive the owners only care about making a buck and not customer service there are better places here in arizona that actually care
this husband and wife team are expensive and conduct unnecessary procedures to run up your bill dr perez did such a horrible root canal job on one of my molars that i lost the tooth and now the bone wont heal therefore i can not get an implant it seemed every time i went in they would spend too much time measuring my gum line and not fixing the problem lrb s rrb dont waste your time or money on these socalled dentists
 zero stars  very disappointed in management yeah would have loved to try it even bought a living social coupon for it but the coupon expired today so i called and asked to speak to the manager to see if they would honor it the teenage sounding hostess who answered the phone says sorry the manager says we do nt honor expired coupons really it expires today and you ca nt honor this we ve never been there and it s already been paid for  so this foodie and her party of wo nt ever try it and will tell friends not to go there as well because of the printer it was hard to tell if it expired today or the th but regardless with the economy the way it is and restaurants sitting empty fuego tacos should have opened their arms to these hungry paying customers the coupon was only for with all of us wanting to drink margarita s and have appetizers and then some tacos tacos are each we would of had each plus at least one if not two margaritas per person at each plus some guacamole at let s do the math people eating tacos   drinking to margarita s  to and orders of guac  total wo tax and tip plus also some of the people wanted to buy a full size lunch and not tacos so add in another so basically because of your uneducated management style and practices fuego tacos lost more than plus tax and tip for lunch on a party of not too mention the whole one person scorned will tell at least people x  lrb which is a low estimate considering the internet and facebook rrb people will now know how cheap and stupid fuego tacos are no matter how good your tacos might have been hope your mod lrb manager on duty rrb feels proud ole  copying to yelp ps so now i see the same coupon deal being offered by yelp with their expiration lasting a whole year instead of the months my coupon had on it nice    now i know the management is inexperienced
food is subpar as is the service go farther west
word is if your over and especially gay stay out this place used to be a fun place to go to the top floor to chat with locals but now it s just another kiddy bar but at least you will see every style imaginable known to man from the long haired hippie looking guy to the flash gordon complete with leather vest and wavy hair to the girl with tubes sticking out of her head i even saw fake golden monkey fur they had a possy taking photos there for guests in a stage setting but the top was cornered off after waiting for about min in line to go to the men s bathroom a manager looking guy told the guy in front of me after this guy in front goes in post these signs on both doors it was a broken do not use sign the guy in front made this lame ass excuse that the bathrooms are in need of repair i thought hmmm very strange apparently they must have this as common practice after pm to just shut off access to bathrooms i am sorry homme you aint no hommie and you done me wrong lrb ps finally took a leak at the abandoned beefeaters down the street rrb
me hey can you help me with a piercing i got here a month ago  it seems to be irritated maybe the ring needs to be changed piercer you should stop picking it me i m not picking it piercer just keep using the salt soaks me i have been for a month and it s not working piercer just keep doing it and come back once it s not so irritated i will be the bad guy here and say that in my ten years of piercings i have never had an experience like this my friend and i went for the valentines day special which was two for one piercings everything went well the place was clean about a week after the piercings my friend said that hers was becoming really irritated so she changed the ring out and it healed fine mine was really irritated and a bubble formed on the side of my nose around the piercing after a month i went back for help because i had been using the salt soaks everyday and not picking it lrb because i m not rrb nothing was helping so in typical hipster fashion the piercer seemed to be placing the blame on me and offered no alternatives to help my situation he must have thought i was younger and did nt know what i was talking about i had it pierced in feb and finally took it out a couple of weeks ago and it healed nicely after i googled what to do and found lot s of different remedies i just could nt believe i paid for this piercing next time i get a piercing i will go to club tattoo corporate chain but at least i get treated like a human being
this restaurant is so close to home i thought i d give it another chance had not been there in years now i remember why the service was surly my husband said something to the manager and now we both have stomach cramps i wonder if he did something to our food  the pina colada was watered down and tasted bitter the fish tacos were ok but the roasted corn that came with it was odd i do nt think i ll be going back any time soon
i had a chance to read the second lrb and only other rrb review for this office that came about a year after mine my review probably sounds pretty shocking because the experience was shocking i describe in very accurate detail the specifics of what was dirty and what was handled unprofessionally i did not exaggerate anything lrb though i fully admit my use of humor undermines the seriousness of my observations rrb i m not complaining that there was nt bottled water service or tvs i think that s pretty clear in my review i m pointing out that i think lrb and i m sure many others would agree rrb that when you go to an office where people stick their hands and instruments into your mouth you do nt want to look around and see grime on the floors counters and walls or rust on the sink fixtures i am not a medical professional but anyone who has even been to a doctor has seen basic protocol when handling a patient lrb ie watching them open a clean pack of tools watching them wash their hands in front of you before touching you rrb and they simply did not follow it here the review is not judgmental  it was fair and honest i pointed out the good lrb what little there was of it rrb and the bad the doctor and all his techs and receptionist were beyond nice and i said as much but that s hardly the most important thing here to this day i regret not walking out after the xrays were taken i do hope that the office was just in some sort of odd transitional phase and that by the time the other reviewer got there things had changed i really do but after what i went through i m not willing to give them a second chance their lack of professionalism and protocol put me in danger and that s unacceptable and not just for me that s unacceptable for anyone  the office does pro bono work for the homeless or kids in cps that s great they deserve professional care just as much as i do
yuck vegetarians be warned ordered their vegetarian bangkok noodles with tofu and found breaded chicken in my dish twice lost my appetite for pei wei
not sure what you did but stop it the tahini sauce tastes like buttermilk the pita which used to be thick like a pancake is now as thin as a crepe i do nt know if you have new owners new cooks but knock it off and return to normal you ve lost a customer
we ordered chicken parmesan for wife and daughter our first night in phoenix the chicken was raw seriously  due to poor lighting they ate some of it before realizing the chicken was raw i am not taking slightly undercooked i m saying raw we notified the manager and she was apologetic and gave us comp cards for next time are u kidding  no way at w going back there wife and daughter got sick the next day stay away
being a dairy queen fan for many years i was surprised by the lessthanpleasant service received at this dairy queen not once but twice i was even more shocked to find out that the illmannered employee was that of the female owner she should pass her dairy queen crown down to someone who actually likes people this type of person should definitely not be in the service industry please pass on this dairy queen
the surliness and thievery committed by the phoenix based tsa employees really ruin phx sky harbor from being a traveler friendly airport this is also the same airport that kills drunk housewives i use this airport weekly and have had numerous gear stolen by tsa employees at checkpoint c stolen items include portable hard drives laptop batteries usb drives and an lcd projector
this used to be my favorite place to get some beer or whatever my kitchen was lacking i am now changing my opinion starting with the fact that they are very overpriced in a college town i spend on two packs well the worst part was that one of the packs was stale skunk whatever you want to call it but gross i drank one and thought something was weird well after one sip of the second beer i knew it was nasty so the next day i went back hoping to simply exchange the sixer for one that was fresh the man working gave me strange looks and never apologized he said well that s the born on date ok i understand that but what i am saying is that i drank this beer and it tasted like dirt granted it s the same brand of beer i always drink and i ve shopped at t s many many times i did not appreciate his unwillingness to help me after i spent enough money to justify going to a happy hour on beer i would hope that a customer service oriented person would at least say that s weird man i m sorry  let me get you a different one needless to say but i will anyways  i left the remaining beers on his counter and will not return
rudest staff ever my girlfriend made reservations for saturday night via opentable when we arrived the hostess argued with her saying she could nt have made reservations as she had the tables blocked until that morning and that she was the one who opened them back up so there was no way we could have had reservations when my friend dumbfoundedly replied that she was sure she made reservations and attempted to pull them up on her iphone the hostess turned her computer monitor around and pointed and said my tables are all blocked and you are not here i was shocked in what society did this sort of attitude become acceptable  what happened to i m sorry m  am i do nt know what happened but your reservation is not appearing in our system unfortunately we are booked solid so it could take an hour or so for a table things can and do happen that is ok but this sort of rudeness is simply intolerable i suppose it is best we were nt able to eat there if the front people are this rude imagine the rest of the staff no food is good enough to be treated like this
i hate this place and i do nt like to use the word hate it s a crime what they charge for pizza in comparison to what you get it s awful and they should be ashamed to serve it many of the games were not working the place was disgustingly dirty and the staff all seemed like they hated the place as much as i do whenever one of my kids gets invited to a birthday party at chuck e cheese s i cringe i d rather shoot myself in the foot with a than go back to this ripoff
yet another disappointing asian establishment in az i know lees is a chain and maybe i just happened to be the unlucky customer but geeeeez skimped on my meat and veggies was only enough to fill half the sandwich i ordered the grilled pork sandwich and also the bbq pork both were dry meat was tough no flavor sandwich was dry and the pickled carrots and radish tasted funny sad night lrb went home and made salad rolls instead
this place is what gives mexican food a bad name the stuff tasted like it came out of a cafeteria after it was reheated i had to go to a tacobell afterwards just to wash the taste out of my mouth with all the wonderful mexican food places in town i dont know how this one stays in business
omg i went in to this burger king thinking i was going to enjoy a quick bite instead i was ripped off i had chosen my meal from the menu and ordered it silly me i thought the price on the menu board was the price i would be charged no apparently you need to specify what size meal you want or the employees of this place are instructed to automatically charge you for the biggest size they offer outrageous stay away from any and all burger king s especially this one
you ll either love this place or hate it i must say this was the worst chinese food i ve had since eating at some place in gallup new mexico back in actually that place was the absolute worst but i m sure there are some tasty dishes this place must have because they were very busy during monday lunch when you walk in this place the first thing you ll notice is the smell of grease then you look around and the atmosphere is dark drab and plastic there is no ambiance then while you are being attended to you ll find the staff not very friendly the none really want to be there and last but not least you ll wonder why you ordered the food you did i got the egg foo young now some of you are wondering how can i criticize a chinese restaurant when i m not even ordering real chinese food all i can say is you might be right but really this dish is so easy to get right that i m amazed at how much they got it wrong the egg patties were drowning in a totally flavorless brown sauce plus they were slightly burned to a crisp so essentially you were eating deep fried charcoal in a tasteless gravy oh and you get a golf ball sized dish of mediocre rice too like i said i ve heard some people love this place i do nt know why but i do have an idea why this place is still in business location location location yes it is centrally located to the dui court and grand jury building right next door that means tons of new people walk past this establishment on a daily basis then there is the towering monstrosities of maricopa country judicial pride just around the corner where hundreds of people work plead or visit for jury duty and where is the only chinese restaurant within any walking distance  you got it sing high my advice do nt go here for the food and do nt go here for the historical significance it s not worth it save that craving for chinese food for something better heck even panda express would do
on our date night my wife and i decided to stop here for dinner before a movie at desert ridge we were greeted right away lrb the place was pretty empty at pm on a saturday rrb and seated at the back corner table we had plenty of time to look at the menu as our waitress seated a table two up from us took their drink order stopped by the table next to ours to check on them looked at us walked back to the front of the restaurant then came back to see if we d been helped uh no the person that seated us apparently had nt told her we were seated  even though it was her section and she saw us when checking on the other customers she did apologize but i did nt buy it there s a difference between trying to pass the buck and blame someone else vs actually being sorry about letting you sit there ok over that let s order couple beers and a couple of signature sandwiches lrb pulled pork with the blue cheese cole slaw not on the sandwich for one rrb for our sides hq lrb that s the wife rrb got the macncheese and i asked her choice between fries and mashed potatoes fries were good she said done got the beers i d swear the beer was flat maybe an old keg it happens after that the food came out quick the pulledpork sandwich had zero sauce literally just bun and pulled pork ok we ll add our own from the bottle on the table lrb i m thinking honey bears where it s got bbq sauce with the meat rrb the sandwich was average at best no taste the sauce not being mixed with the meat just had nothing to it and the blue cheese cole slaw that was on the side again absolutely no taste bland now the fries the menu said russett fries i guess i m picturing steaklike fries nope just plain ol fies and these were not actually cooked all the way not good to summarize flat beer bland bbq sandwich bland blue cheese cole slaw and undercooked fries safe to say it s not a place we ll go to again
service so unspeakably bad that i will yelp about it instead stopped for a drink before the symphony it was a little busy but nothing out of the ordinary there were a few empty tables though most were dirty waited for at least minutes before a server passed by and said she would be back shortly shortly turned into unacceptably long so my husband went to the bar to order there the bartender walked by him several times and again would not acknowledge him much less take his order keep in mind he was not rushing to make drinks he was cleaning up i find it hard to believe we re invisible maybe just undesirable  regardless we left and went elsewhere
 do nt go here it simply is nt worth it and i am not just talking about the food the food is meh at best  nothing special at all we tried it for breakfast and we had the ham and cheese omelet and the kids french toast was nt horrible but was nt great either why the star  because they do nt validate parking which means when your total breakfast tab is less than bucks you are going to pay bucks for parking unless you are lucky enough to get a spot with a meter right in front of the restaurant oh and there are no signs that tell you they do nt valiate parking  you just get to learn it the hard way or read this  and simply skip this place trust me you are nt missing anything  there are plenty of other great places within a block radius to go to breakfast
i do nt like the pizza hear and if you go for lunch there are no specials by the slice the ranch tastes bottled and tastes gross the ingredients are not fresh but rather canned lrb also gross rrb the chicken wings were not that great either the atmosphere was nice for a casual place with a couple of flat screen tv s on the wall i will not be going back to this place so hopefully they get better soon since barro s pizza is going in the area soon
terrible service we made a reservation and ended up seated at a bar forget enjoying the company of our out of town guests because we could nt ear each other so they thought they could buy us off with a complimentary glass of champagne i guess i m fickle  wanting to be seated at a table when i make reservations
this was so poorly organized it was hard to believe we were in line minutes just to get to park the foo lines were all a one hour wait i would never go again
i went here tonight since i was seeing a movie and thought it would be nice to grab something close to the theaters i ordered a slice of pizza and my husband ordered a calzone  they brought my pizza out minutes before my husbands food was done so of course my pizza was cold by the time i started eating the waitresses were nice enough but clearly need some training on top of my pizza being cold it kind of tasted like puke we will not be coming back i m disappointed i was so hoping to like this place since i come to the amc by it so often do yourself a favor and skip this place pita jungle is a few stores down and has much better food lrb i even like their pita pizzas better rrb
i loved chuy s their baja tacos will always be a fond memory for me this location is closed and probably will be forever they were nt playing by the rules go across the street for some good eats
the service was extremely pleasant but the rest of the meal was terrible my husband and i went for lunch today first we ordered a salad to share which amounted to about  cup of lettuce with a slice of cucumber and a slice of tomato next i had the lunch special which was which consisted of a very small cup of watery chicken soup and  cuban sandwich both the soup and the sandwich were a big disappointment my husband ordered some sort of over cooked meat dish it was watery and tasteless this came with black beans and rice i m at a loss for words on how to describe them but yuck his entree was for lunch the only thing good things was the flan and the cuban coffee my suggestion is to only go there for dessert
here is my saga of the christmas tree i had an eye out for christmas trees since ours finally fell apart last year after years of faithful service i went to paddock s after spotting a great sale in october after what seemed like hours of debating with myself i bought a  foot tree unfortunately i did nt open it until thanksgiving when i found that it looked as though it might have been a return there were no directions or packaging and the pieces of the tree were not fastened with the ties in the box undaunted we put up the tree and found the entire thing to be poorly made could this be the same one i picked out at the store  the branches did nt sit correctly and there were big holes where it was easy to see the middle rod the tips kept falling off frankly it looked like a charlie brown tree  a really expensive charlie brown tree i bundled it back up and dragged it back to paddocks i wanted to get a larger fuller tree and was willing to spend more money i was directed to the manager who investigated my purchase he said that i had bought an as is tree and it could not be returned this thing cost a lot money even on sale i swear no one told me it was an as is tree i would nt have bought an as is tree  i would nt have bought a tree that looked so different from the one on display  and i would nt have spent a lot of money on an as is tree i dragged the tree back home and looked at it again figuring that i could try to live with it i could nt i went shopping again and found lots of places with expensive crummy trees know where i found a beautiful reasonably priced tree among a big selection of gorgeous trees  sears i did nt even know that sears was still in business however the service was good the tree was packaged perfectly and there were directions and extra bulbs and best of all it s gorgeous do not buy a tree at paddock s
i have been going to dog parks for over ten years my five year old daughter was literally standing next to me not on the ground interacting with any dogs did not have a toy in her hand had no treats and was attacked by a boxerpit mix she received many stitches to her face the owner made no attempt to help us
talk about bad mexican food stale grocery store taco shells boiled shredded beef and the blandest refried beans you ve ever had the salsa is decent but that s about it wo nt be going back
still closed
i ve gotten sick from this food a few times the worst food option in park central
waited minutes in the terminal section with no service there were other patrons that were waiting on checks etc i dont know why i stayed so long but it wont happen again
what a dump my recent experience at the marquee theatre was essentially like every other reviewers  slow security with bad attitudes  take my shoes off  really   weak overpriced drinks  dirty nasty venue  rude ass police outside  just plain trashy in the immortal words of danny glover i m getting to old for this h  t 
the original owners from sorrento italy do not own the place now the prices and new menu may be cheaper but the quality of their food has deteriorated along with the service the blonde server is the owners daughter and had to ask the cook in the back what beef carpacio is it used to be on their menu the garlic in the bolognase was too strong the caprese had mozzarella that could have been bought at your local grocery store it was not fresh nor were the tomatoes the new owners might have the recipes but lack the basic knowledge of italian cuisine and customer service they are coasting on the reviews from the past owners
i m with the reviewer from  i ve been shopping at be since i was a kid in the s and after yesterday i m done i went in on saturday and spent a couple hours purchasing over of clothes turns out one of the shirts i bought had huge holes down the middle of the back unsewable and totally unwearable i went back sunday to see if i could return it for store credit and to trade in several bags of my old clothing long story short  one of the managers gave me a really hard time about returning the shirt as it had been half off and she treated me like a total jerk for asking her to work with me and acted like she was doing me the biggest favor in the world by accepting the return she was pretty snotty and rude then when it was my turn to trade a nice guy began helping me and had accepted a couple of my things and things seemed fine said manager showed up elbowed the guy out of the way and began going through my items herself she purchased one item out of several large bags and sent me on my way it was an incredible blatant fu to me for forcing her hand when it came to my return what grade are we in again  i am still amazed that this even happened what a great manager i bet her employees really enjoy working for her it s too bad i found lots of clothes i loved but i ll stick to other businesses like my sister s closet and whatnot where the employees are nice and do nt sell clothes that ca nt be worn
worst customer service ever the place was pretty much empty we arrived around pm there was only other occupied tables in the whole place our waitress took an hour to give us our drinks our first set of drinks was the chilled green tea which we had to send back because it had the most strong burnt taste she never checked up on us never gave us refills when she came for our menu we waited about min and then another hour before we got the bill we wanted to order more but decided to leave before it hit around dinner time not to mention it was definatley not worth the of sushi we spent here the food was good but not great we had better quality else where also their happy hour is only  pm on sundays will never return my actual review would be zero stars
this the second time at this place in years i went for lunch and here is my review service fast food i had a gyro meal plus taxes around a bit too high for lunch gyro was sort of too dry and salty i asked the lady and i think she was the owner for a side of the gyro sauce and she was sort of rude she said the gyro already has sauce i told her i know is just sort of too dry and she said well is cents do you want it or not  in my head i was like really  i m your guest and you are treating me like that i was like no thanks then when i was eating i asked a hispanic girl if they charge for the hot sauce she said we have tabasco why do nt you ask at the counter overall i do nt think i will ever go back restaurant owners and workers tend to forget little things like that attention to details or small things that will make someone never go back again that s me and i also work in a huge office nearby i sent an email to all my coworkers wich are like workers about my bad experience overall i ll never go back
really bad opt for paradise cafe  bakery
we out the other night with my girlfriend and was craving a good burger since this place is right next to where i live we walked over could nt walk out fast enough if you are in the mood for a bland burger this is your place and if you are looking for a place where the decor is as annoying as the bad service this is definately your place  update  so after writing this i received an email from a person claiming to be the owner of the restaurant they said they were sorry for the bad experience and would like for me to come back all the while informing me that they had a hard time believing that the burger was just as i said bland lrb rule  in business your clients perception is their reality rrb after a few emails this person asked for my mailing address and again asked me to come back sometime to this day i have not received whatever it may be that i was suppose to receive by mail i would encourage anyone who chooses to go to blu burger to just look for another spot in my opinion your will be better spent elsewhere
monday morning am i came to recycle a toner cartridge and buy a custom rubber stamp the sales associate in printing standard reply was i do nt know to virtually all of my questions no help at all  i gave up i had to use the men s room and it had a filthy toilet urinal that was near overflowed broken faucet handle paper towel and toilet paper rolls sitting on top of things instead of in the dispensers and a dead cockroach to top it off i do nt need to come back to this store the manager needs to take a little pride
if you are looking for a store to waste a whole lot of time in this is it this has to be the worst home depot store i have ever been in the service is awful the so called experts have to directed me to the wrong aisle on many occasions they used to walk with you and at least show you were a product is now they tell you what aisle something is in but sometimes they do nt really know last weekend i was in there looking for something and it took minutes to even find someone to help me it s like they scatter when they see a customer there was not one person in hardware and i could not find a single person in lumbar another customer asked me if he is supposed to cut his own wood i finally found a customer service rep and he directed me to the wrong row i found him again and he once again gave a place to go to find a product he just stood there not doing anything eventually i dumped the few things i had and left what a mockery of customer service ace is the place to go
we chose bourbon steak for restaurant week and were sadly disappointed we were seated in the bar not the actual restaurant as apparently they did not want to offend regular clientele with the servings several couples were all seated together along a wall with the restaurant week menus the server came and told us he recommended a kobe steak interesting as it was the most expensive item we were given a salad that honestly had bites the portions were small and the food was so average will never be back
great service waitress was very nice the chiefs interacted but the food was terrible i sent the spicy tuna role back because it tasted old the rest of the food had bad flavor they need to get some senior sushi chiefs before you go these guys are not good i love sushi and i have eaten a lot of it all over the world including japan this place you would be better off going to the grocery store
went for a special occasion and let them know in advance asked for a nice table we were put in a corner in a cold area was so cold my shoulders hurt and feet were like ice when i asked to move they were reluctant even though the place was far from full they did move us however next to a drafty door the waiter comes out overly friendly with phoney smile as others on the staff the truffel soup was like a bowl of salt water the pasta dish was cheap dumplings with frozen peas and mexican shrimps chopped up so small and yes a lot of salt the salmon was bland but the mashed cauliflower under it was salty and not cooked all the way the broclii was burned we left half of our meals on our plates and no one asked why  the service was horrible we constantly had to ask the bus person to find us the waiter way way overpriced and an added  service charge for poor service they never said thanks good bye or come again i read so much good about the farms that i really wanted to go but it is a never again does not deserve a nd chance for and did not eat and beverages also my stomach was very uncomforatable from so much salt i felt very nausiated
i was on a mission to find a birthday present for my mom so i gave steinmart a shot tucked away in the center by bamboo club and chili s it does nt look too bad from the outside i walked in took about paces and was overcome with an overwhelming sense of depression i spotted some jeggings and muumuus on racks that were awkwardly high for the place this store is not wellplanned as claustrophobia sank in i glanced around for home wares and spotted a tiny little section by the main entrance they had a couple grill racks and some tacky kitschy knickknacks i think not i hightailed it out of there increasingly relieved as i made progress toward my car
worse food and service i ve ever experienced extremely rude people work here they were busy and a nasty waitress added drinks we never even ordered then was rude when we questioned her she removed the drinks then was a complete bitch i suggest you pay as you order for drinks or really check your bill before you pay
ok conspire normally has some of the best chai in town but i feel they may be falling fast i ordered a hot soy chai this morning and recieved a cup that contained none of my order it was tepid at best made with whole milk and had no chai flavor at all in leiu of the chai they had flavored my beverage with about a gallon of honey not to mention it rook the girl about  hrs to complete my two drink order now the owner who is normally there makes a delicious chai but what ive learned is not to bother if there is anyone else behind the counter apperantly they have zero consistancy
alright this is the last time i am gonna give this place a chance i have attempted to try every type of food they have here to see exactly what the hype is all about and why oregano s is always at least a min wait to be seated this last time i went i vowed to order one of the salads and their traditional pepperoni pizza because these are the items i have heard so much about from other people i tasted some of the picasso salad and a regular garden salad yes both were large but all that came to mind while eating them was meh the ranch dressing that came with my garden salad tasted straight out of the bottle and the picasso salad was nothing impressive i swear there was more tortilla strips in that salad then lettuce do nt get me wrong i love tortilla strips but they are supposed to accent the salad not act as the entire salad now on to the pizza i had tried their picasso pizza before and was not impressed i figured i ordered wrong so i decided to get a simple slice of pepperoni pizza this time around nothing impressive to be honest too much cheese that was melted but not gooey almost like it had been sitting the marinara sauce was nothing special and it really did nt have any flavor and the thin crust was almost non existent it tasted like i was eating just a big blob of cheese plus there was a small hair on it oh and i did nt even mention that for salads and lunch special pizza slices we waited about minutes  i just do nt get what the hype is about with this place maybe people in az do nt know good pizza  if ya want good pizza head to nello s or sal s gilbert pizza skip oregano s unless your tastebuds are severely lacking you are in for a letdown
the first time we went to bill johnson s we informed the restaurant of my food allergy the server told me that my salad had no onions in it while i was eating my salad i started tasting onions when i asked the server why there were small pieces of onion in my salad she said she thought she had picked them out then i found out that the wonderful homemade salad dressing also had chopped onions in it what the hell  dinner was a special night so i waited for my family to finish their meals and we left later that evening i had to deal with the consequences of ingesting raw onions this is a reason why i do nt like to dine out and i ask about the foods that i order when we do dine out we could hear the server talking to someone behind the wall about a customer who might complain i spoke with a rep from bill johnsons and he assured me that he would contact management at this location and would make sure that all the staff we made aware that food allergies are a serious issue and that if a customer has a special request that it is to be taken seriously he also offered me a gift certificate to come back and give them another try please note on previous occasions i have developed serious reactions to raw onions and have required hospitalization that have lasted as long as days i m not just someone who wants to complain and get a free meal and for the record i was nt even offered a comp on my meal nor was the manager ever informed moving on we went back last night with my sister and it was a complete let down our server brought us two cups of tortilla soup with cheese sprinkled on top the soup was barely warm and when we informed the server she said that she gave us the last of the soup which was scraped from the container that had been removed from the warming unit and was sitting on the counter she said that she thought it had nt been sitting for too long so she figured that it still warm enough wth  you can make folks sick by not having foods at their proper temperatures the rest of the meal was okay nothing to write home about and just meh sorry bill johnson s you just lost us i would have given you at least a star but my poor stomach is still suffering from last night s vomit session
suck lrb ssuuukkkk rrb an intransitive verb indicating a negative state of affairs synonymous with blow and bite to be really really crappy
 why am i here  was the only thing i could think of while standing on the handicap ramp in a very crowded very poorly chosen location i ve thought about the positives expansive craft beer selection relatively quick service considering the space constraints and crowd size live music and lots of guest brewers coming in lrb shoutout to four peaks rrb but after considering all of these positives i was still standing on a ramp with a brewdog ipa lrb which is amazing rrb in hand questioning why in the world they would put this great of a concept in this terrible of a location i ca nt help but to think that world of beer inc saw an opportunity to capitalize on the craft beer culture that has been pioneered by the likes of the roosevelt tavern four peaks papago brewing and taste of tops lrb among others rrb and forced their corporate concept on to mill ave in to whatever space they could find it should be noted that this floridabased company is being run by the former management of outback steakhouse at least i hope the franchisee is a local and has better bona fides than the corporate outback crew if you really are in to craft beer support your local proprietors
i have never flown us airways since they became us airways i did however fly america west and was happy with them nearly every time i flew with them i have to write this review as i had an awful experience with them yesterday i was scheduled at am out of phoenix and arriving back here in sf at am in enough time for work at am i arrive and proceed to the e checkin the computer starts having issues and so i try to get the attendants attention and i failed knowing i did nt have a lot of time before we depart i decided to to to the counter checkin i waited minutes before getting to the counter only to be told that i was no longer on this flight bc it was less than minutes before departure what  i have a carry on annnnnd that computer right there lrb pointing at it rrb has something wrong with it and that is why i came through your line it was minutes to departure and she refused to check me in again i only had a carry on it did nt matter to her that i had to be at work at am arriving in sf later than am was not an option for me she hastily said you can try and get through security and see if maybe they ll let you on the flight that is all i will do for you i finally get through security and get to the gate at exactly am one minute to spare begging the customer services reps to let me on the flight or i was going to lose my job they of course told me no the flight was delayed hours and i was late anyway ahhhhh thankfully the flight attendant had a lot of personality and was very accommodating to me even if i was hours late for work i wish i had the name of that lady in the phoenix airport downstairs at the check in desk i mean when i pointed to the computer that was giving me problems there was a tech guy working on it and she saw him even seeing him she still would nt accommodate me in any way and was rude about it poor customer service i wo nt be flying this airline again i can tell you that i was not only blown away by their complete lack of care for me and the issues i was having with their echeckin computer but also the lack of social skills one needs when working in customer service eye contact
i just had my car in for a auto accident during the visit the shop broke the ignition on the car they are taking no responsibility and said it was already broken they had the car for a week if it was already broken how were they able to stop and start the car that whole week the repairs are going to run more than and they will not even help pay for half do nt take your car here it was their location on cave creek and hatcher
they make their pancakes with peanut oil which makes me sad because i m allergic to peanuts so yeah until they use something else i literally ca nt eat pancakes here
learned a lesson on my recent visit ask and confirm the price before having the service done or you ll end up with all sorts of extras here and there that they tacked onto your bill after all of these years of coming to nail depot i wo nt come back here again this is a very dishonest and desperate way to suck an extra from a regular customer sad there are nail salons on every street corner i m sure i wo nt have problems finding a new place to spend my dollars for nail service
hmmmm think i would rather suck down your colonoscopy bag  if you are truly looking for a unique dining experience accompanied with old world business cards and lifeless animals then you will need to try out texaz grill all for yourself if you are looking for good food solid service and a nice atmosphere then you probably want to avoid this strip mall hangout at all costs if you love lowquality food poor service and a revolting atmosphere then you need to steer your lifted f right on over to texaz grill wow from the moment we walked in i knew we were in for trouble i just did nt think it could be as bad as it actually was this is one establishment that will leave you wondering whether the city of phoenix mandates any sort of cleanliness or health standards this place is dirty vile unkempt and this is way before we even met our server or received our food just pm on a thursday night but you would have thought this place was closing up shop for the night or permanently lrb which would nt be a bad thing rrb guests are sparse and the few who do remain look like they have chain smoked all of taste buds right out of their mouths the servers give you the impression they are not working for tips and really make no attempt at ensuring a pleasant guest experience the inside will remind you of a cross between a real small town bbq joint and a tgifridays minus the corporate cleanliness standards the booths are ancient uncomfortable and anything but clean the walls are littered with business cards dead animals used hats and license plate frames you will want to write off all the dirt and disaster on the wall as good old texas charm but you will quickly realize your appetite fades as each minute passes you by so we arrive at our booth and are quickly greeted by our degenerate server who you would have thought was being paid by number of tables she turned over per night she does nt look like she wants to be there and frankly neither do we our drinks are brought out in a timely fashion and then she did the best she could to get us to order a quickly as possible and we re off orders are put in for a chicken fried steak and the thursday night bbq sampler our server had to check that there were any of the bbq samplers left which should tell you that this combination was probably made yesterday and has been hanging around all day the salad came quick  too quick within two minutes of ordering i had the misfortune of choking down a brown bland and boring salad of course nobody goes to a bbq joint for a salad but i think most prefer green lettuce and more than two dressing choices not even ten minutes later and our entrees had arrived and we suddenly had enough food to feed an entire homeless shelter but i have my doubts of them even touching this piss poor attempt at texas bbq chicken fried steak  imagine about oz of beef shankle meat breaded in a pound of breading and smothered in some alien gravy the meat was bland veiny chewy and not even good enough for my neighbor s dog you get two of them and each one will be bigger than your head but i m not really sure what you are supposed to do with them because they are anything but edible bbq sampler  i would have rather have sampled what was soaked up in the dirty bar rag or growing out of the rug the ribs were too fatty and smothered in the generic bbq sauce that made this place famous the brisket was boring and overcooked the texas fries were not fries nor were they good the sausage was edible but more so in a comparative way even the bread was terrible the food can be summed up as atrocious inedible poor quality and even hard to look at truly some of the worst food i have ever eaten or looked at in my entire life the highlight of the night was easily when our server seemed astonished we refused the togo box sorry but you should have been shaking our hands for even trying to make a meal out of those makemewanttogovegetarian plates of meat it is worth mentioning that texas grill does two things and two things only correctly you will be seated quickly to ensure that the dead animals or the plethora of s business cards stapled to the walls do nt scare you away and the plastic soft drink mugs are gigantic but i m sure this was implemented to minimize server interaction with the tables go grab a mcrib or two before you throw away any money at this place or be ready to pop some serious laxatives outside of some rough drinking nights i have never felt the urge to vomit all over the place hours after a meal good luck to you if you choose this place if you do decide to go do nt forget to bring your business card  it might be old enough to go up on the wall in  that is assuming this place is around much longer
seriously  so i ordered from them twice last week delivery they messed up my order just a little lrb wrong bread rrb on one of them eh no big deal the delivery time was ok but not fast about minutes well today i need to leave my house for a job interview at so i order at i wait till then leave my wife is still home apparently they showed up around sorry but that is not freaky fast at all then they have the nerve to say i am out of their delivery area then what are you doing  did they tell me this and say it make take longer than usual no did they decline my order for delivery no not to mention why they heck am i out of your delivery range i live at th  bell  mile from your shop i canceled my order and they gave me my money back but the whole situation is very frustrating i love the food and when i have ordered from other locations it is truly freaky fast very disappointed in how this location carries the jjs name
service is touch and go here i will not be coming back tony did my fill last time and he was rude he also burned me a few times with the electric file very rough with my hands and gave me an attitude after he stepped on my toe and smudged my polish
i was really excited when this place finally opened i decided to go there for postdrinks munchies on my birthday since it s open hours some of my friends opted for breakfast and my boyfriend and i opted to split some buffalo wings and a burger the breakfasts looked dreadful eggs looking up from their plates all sad and pale and it seemed like every side order came quite a while later my boyfriend absolutely love buffalo wings i mean loves buffalo wings he love them so much he once drank the leftover wing sauce from a takeout container lrb much to the chagrin of his stomach rrb so we thought we were in for a latenight treat the wings came out with no sign of sauce not even a light coating we were hungry so we tried them anyways i do nt know how they did it but somehow the wings were both charred and slightly undercooked whatever kind of spice they used on them was burnt beyond recognition and again no sauce i think that my burger was more salt than burger lrb i ve heard rumors that terrorists have been sneaking into american kitchens and pouring salt in the food to kill us slowly so maybe sally s is a victim  rrb i ve eaten terrible burgers even ones at applebees but this one was absolutely inedible  even in my slightly inebriated state my roommate ordered the navajo taco but that soggy bland excuse for the real thing was also too horrible to eat i hope that sally s navajo taco meets up with a state fair navajo taco in a dark alley in south phoenix i hope that after their summer vacation sally s hires new kitchen staff  right now i would only recommend it to people i hate
good food horrible service worse management i ca nt grasp the whole we do nt have servers assinged bit we want everyone to feel welcomed so we have everyone waiting on you bs that s the worst way to run a restaraunt every time i ve been they ve forgotten part of our order andor just ignorred us id rather eat at liberty market across the street i ve spoken to managment about the bad service and all the gal has done is make excuses that s not how you run a place i believe in word of mouth and the words out of my mouth to everyone i know is not to patron this location
my family comes here off and on since it is near by and pretty cheap we decided to come in for a family breakfast and while it is cheap the food is terrible the eggs tasted more like those liquid ones that are over done their bacon strips are like thin sticks that were pretty tasteless and their biscuits were hard like they were stale my brotherinlaw said their eggs were terrible but i figured that it was just a bad experience for him but nope they were bad but were bad in a different way than he explained lrb too runny for him mine were hard and could even choke them down rrb the server was slow and only listened to half of what we requested never dropped off syrup for my sister s order took us getting up and asking someone behind the counter for the syrup and tabasco sauce she did nt come around to refill drinks nearly as often as i had hoped either the place was nt busy enough to warrant the neglect we received but i am sure a regular would disagree i will not come back here for breakfast at least but with other places nearby i could choose from this is the bottom of my return list
my nana would be ashamed knowing that i ate at this place ordered chimichanga with rice and beans food was really really greasy and flavorless no bueno
dominoscom says the store is open until oclock i called at waiting on hold for minutes and nobody picked up what gives  also the website wo nt let you place an online order if you live in tortosa yet they will deliver when you call this is been an issue for years and i ve asked them to fix it several times their only solution is to have you place a takeout order online and then call them and have them change it to a delivery order
first off i know i m going to come off as sounding crazy because it seems like everyone loves this place i have had separate experiences that just were nt up to par lrb st time was a pickup order  the steak was extremely chewy nd time was similar to my experience i had on sunday rrb i went to have dinner with my boyfriend and we were promptly seated but that is where the promptness ended when we finally received our food lrb both had the seafood sampler for somewhere around per plate rrb and everything tasted similar without any of the wow factor i was hoping for the worst part was when we were done eating the waitress brought us our togo boxes and then took minutes to bring us the check we debated on just leaving but decided to be responsible but lets just say the tip was minimal overall this place just was nt worth my bill at the end of the night i ended up having a bomb dinner the next day at jason s dell for and i enjoyed it way more nuff said
way to go macayo s thanks for ruining my birthday meal i had hundreds of choices and sadly i chose you  lrb after minutes of waiting for our food i practically begged somebody else s waiter to either find our food or find our waitress a few minutes later our waitress comes out and says that they ca nt find one of the plates what  after minutes they realized they have a ticket dangling there right in front of their faces and they ca nt find one of the plates  we both ordered off of the  summer specials menu you know the one you charge double for needless to say we walked mi patio on rd aveosborn was much better and much cheaper anyway and they let ol bobbyq know that they not only appreciated my business but that they appreciated my birthday
if i could give less than star i would this is by far the worst pharmacy last week they had me run a prescription back to them that they gave me that was not mine today two of the rudest pharmacists lrb and the pharmacy mgr is rude rrb both told me to circle back around because they had nt started processing a refill that was called in days ago all this took me was min in the car and this is nt the first time they ve been rude and taken forever i ll be driving farther to a pharmacy that is nt rude and screwing up they never fail
i ve been to better outbacks in the ghetto s of detroit went once ordered prime rib ordered it med rare it came out gray server never came back wife finished meal went to hostess stand and asked for manager manager apologized did nt take plate away server came back and i asked her to get this plate out of my site she told me not to be angry she had other tables my food was comped got a gift card left hungry gave card to a friend i ll never go to a chain steak place again i was also told by a former outback manager that downtown scottsdale outback is one of the lowest rated outback s in the country go figure
be prepared to be upset it is gone has been for several years now
went for food not drinks we did nt know the prices were inflated to compensate for coupons they apparently regularly offer so it seemed a bit steep food was fine service was thoughtless also they may want to check their plumbing or get some sort of filter their tap water had a horrible smell and taste
i ve eaten here times and i kick myself for going back the other times the first time it was terrible it was fish and chips and there was nothing but heavy batter you had a hard time finding the fish it must have been thin as a sheet of paper but i gave it a second chance figuring it might have been a bad day for the cook so this time a got adventurous and had a ribeye steak what a disaster it was cooked dry so overly done i could nt cut it with a knife i asked for mediumrare so convinced i would not ever go back until my neighbor begged me to go with her and again terrible food this place i would never recommend to anyone and i made it very clear to my neighbor i would not be returning
my husband had heard about neds from a friend at work that raved to him about it so one late afternoon driving back from vegas we stopped for some sandwiches first off the young teenage boy at the register was less than helpful  had about as much personality as a door nail he was very short with me  being that this was our first visit i asked how the chicken salad was his response was i do nt know i do nt eat it wanting to turn around  walk out based on his response but being exhausted from driving hrs i did nt have the energy to go some place else second there were a couple families dining inside with small children almost the entire time they were running back  forth kicking the service counter where i was standing trying to place my order and that not being enough they were screaming  yelling  play shooting at each other i could nt hear myself think the parents never said a word as they continued to be menaces next which i thought was quite hilarious is that when our order was ready the same kid calls out order  i was still standing at the service counter i looked around thinking are there others who are waiting  yeah no he was shouting out my order for pickup really  i felt like that scene from meet the fockers where the ticket agent wo nt let him board the plane until his seat is called even though he s the only customer i could nt help but laugh finally the icing on the cake from this visit was the days of volatile vomiting as a direct result of eating at neds i got food poisoning awesome i had the chicken ranch sub the ranch dressing was sour tasting but i overlooked it being hungry  exhausted sadly after that one  only experience i can not share the same enthusiasm with the other reviewers we will not be back word of advice for future patrons eat at your own risk
when a company refused to give out their list of ingredients and lies to the customer as to what is in the yogurt it is called deceit please be weary as this place does not use all natural ingredients and their sugar free flavors have tons of sugar in them buyer beware
what happened to this place  it used to be so amazing and had a great staff no more service is horrible i am not usually big on reviews but this place has gone soo far down hill that i had to share  hopefully it saves someone from experienceing a horrible night save your money and try one of the great bars within walking distance
do not take your vehicle if you value your sanity and your money this was the worst auto repair experience i ve had and if i never have another experience like this one it would still be too soon for me
horrible service almost an hour to get our food no discount on our food but yet the manager had no problem sitting at the counter eating his pot roast not once came by to apologize or comp food complained to corporate office and got a generic all purpsoe email umm yeah about the i blew for bad service cold food and attitude i was starting to turn my attitude about denny s thinking they were doing better but they proved they are nt things happen but when the corporate office ca nt even call to apologize that is saying we do nt care
went back for our th or th time the new summer lobster menu lured us in all three of us ordered the lobster and shrimp summer salad big disappointment as we drove away i said maybe i do nt really like lobster my companions felt it was nt really lobster the shrimp was nt that good either the vegetables were great but at for a salad it s not worth it my salad had half a dozen small mushrooms my wife found only one in hers if this had been our first visit we would not return we may not anyway suggest if this is the best they can do the salad
beware this credit union charges a account closing fee i have accounts with other credit unions and other banks  none of them charge an account closing fee when i opened an account here this fee did nt exist at some point in the last few years they added the fee and supposedly notified customers in the usual account mailings that i love to ignore when i closed the account i was surprised by the fee and complained but the customer reps just kept saying you had a chance to close out the account when the policy change was mailed out well i ll instead take this chance to warn my fellow yelpers of this strange fee and who knows what new strange fees they ll add in the future  i would steer clear of this credit union
extremely disappointed i have frequented this rubio s for years on my last visit there ever i watched every second of the near halloween horror my carry out order was brought to another table to an elderly couple who were obviously dining in when the front counter guy asked if they were carrying out they said they did nt care i watched them open the carry out boxes i watched them take the boxes to the salsa counter i watched them take a bite from the boxes i watched them shut the boxes when the counter guy realized that he brought them the wrong order when their order was finally ready and called out at the front counter i watched in horror as he ran over to their table and told them that they received the wrong order and he closed their boxes and brought them to my table and handed them to me i was horrified i was in shock i said um i m not taking that if they put stuff on it and i know they put stuff on it and took a bite the counter guy opened up the box and said i do nt see any stuff on it it is fine he closed the box and handed it back to me another customer walked passed me and i glanced at him in horror hoping to get some kind of compassion and sympathy he stared back at me with no emotion i turned to the counter guy and said i really do nt want to take the boxes if they put stuff on it he says i do nt see that they put anything on it it s fine and he laughed it does nt matter to me if he laughed at me or thought it was funny but it was not funny i walk out of the store dazed and in shock with the two boxes never in my life even in the dirtiest grossest restaurant have i blatantly experienced anything like this when i got home i opend the box to microwave the hell out of the plates thinking i would give it to my dogs  and there was a foot long hair embedded across both tacos which i slowly pulled out aggggggggghhhhhhhhhhh i can not even make this s  it up i will never ever go back there ever again good luck suckers i hope you take your cipro you get what you pay for never ever again the only plus was that it was free taco weekend and the counter guy gave me a free taco which i threw away after gagging pulling out the embedded hair for years the service was friendly and excellent what happened  lrb i m on my way to baja loco
i guess its better than mcdonalds i was still hungry after their delux burger and ff if there is no place to eat late at night it beats burger king and mcdolads
ordered a meatball sandwich with french fries for delivery  could nt be more disappointed the sandwich was soggy to the point the bread had disintegrated into mulch did they soak this thing in a bathtub for a few hours before delivering it  the fries tasted as though they d been left to sit for much longer than they should have and were also very soggy  my guess is that they sat in a pool of grease all night i wo nt order from here again and i recommend you do nt either
fry s what s wrong with you  i heard a news report you laidoff your greeters last week sending them packing shame on you the reporter explained how these people were part time stating they would each receive a dollar severance package and presumably a goodbye card from hr signed by a gaggle of the victim s coworker s most of whom they probably did nt even know well that s generous of you did it ever occur to you that maybe you did nt need to lose the greeter but instead lose the idiot who while i m trying to shop in a four foot wide aisle comes waltzing down the aisle with a three foot wide dustmop making me squeeze to the side hoping like hell i do nt knock something made of glass and full of liquid off the shelf  i know you do nt care what i have to say but i can pretty much guarantee that most people would much rather have a smiling face hand them a shopping cart free from toddler spittle lrb or vomit tears diaper leakage or any other human exfoliation rrb than they would having some nonsmiling buffoon mindlessly cruise the aisles with his  get the fuck outa my way broom i hate sounding cliche but i m just sayin bonehead move fry s
i got a  off coupon in the mail so decided to try this place with a couple of friends we eat breakfast out at least twice a week and are always looking to try new indie places kafe will not be on regular rotation i was charged for croque madame and coffee the food was completely bland egg was plastic and tomato was not ripe the coffee was most likely the same stuff delivered to every office building and i do nt understand why they have to use wasteful plastic knives and forks lrb they have china for plates and mugs rrb this place comes no where near matt s big breakfast or morning glory at the farm it is a shame but unless there is a serious shakeup i give kafe six months before there is a for lease sign up and for those people who claim this is a nice change from ihop or denny s my reply is live a little and try any of the dozen or more excellent nonchain breakfast places in and around phoenix
honestly every single time i shop at this location i leave feeling belittled and bewildered i m not a professional mua but i make sure to do extensive research before purchasing any cosmetic item on several occasions i ve gone into this sephora with the intent of purchasing  dollars worth of merchandise you d think i d have learned my lesson by now yet i continue to throw myself into the gauntlet of useless employees that wander aimlessly and reek of arrogance i hate this sephora by far the worst one i ve ever been to it s a shame i live on the west side of town because the scottsdale location is far superior time and time again i leave this location feeling as though i ve been looked down upon and written off or better yet i get information about products i m not the least bit interested in unfortunately i ll be taking my business elsewhere in the future oh and i believe the woman who assisted me last week was named megan here s a tip for you change your foundation i m surely not buying a product if you re wearing it and i can see every pore wrinkle and hair on your face
dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dum dummmmmmmbbbbb waited in line forever cuz the sensor did nt pick up our truck so we proceeded to the window to place our order  had to tell the girl times that we wanted a mcgriddle real slow like so they d understand english or so we hoped but alas it sha nt be they even had it correct on the receipt but nay i tell you nay the screwed it up afterall
the worse airline ever god forbid if they buy aa they will also screw that airline up forever also
between the bland chicken horrible tasting condiments and the fake machaca this has been by far the worst mexican restaurant i do nt understand what triggered their mind to go into the restauranteur business  machaca is supposed to be a dry beef with egg but this was oozing of water because it was broiled good thing i do nt live around here i had found this on yelp from a dr visit
hugely disappointing everything was overcooked lrb and the chicken tastes like woooooood rrb they use store bought pita lrb which was gummy rrb the manager said he was nt sure why the chicken was so tough i told him i think it s bc they cooked it for too long bust
what do you get when you have a table of managers and owners sitting around having a meeting while a table of two have been waiting minutes for a club sandwich and cheeseburger  disappointment when i asked the server what was taking so long he said i know it s taking a real long time for your food asked him to check on it and minutes later we got our food we had been coming here on a regular basis and the service was always mediocre food was consistent i have to give credit where credit is due but when we missed our movie today because of the length of time and we purposely went after the lunch rush at and there was only others in the restaurant when the bill came and there was no adjustment or none of the management came over i specifically asked the server to break up the meeting so that someone could attend to their customers when the manager came over i said are you aware of the ticket time of our food  he said yes and i said and you made no attempt to apologize or try to make things right by offering dessert or anything  everyone there recognized us as being regulars except the manager who should make it his business to know his customers he said i guess i could take off your sandwich i said i should nt have had to ask you should be more aware and take more care and pride in your customers and ticket time of your food it wasnt about a free sandwich it s about caring about your customers with all the other burger places in the area i will never go back there
popped in here on a whim one day and wandered around for a bit did nt actually want to really touch much of anything i felt like i was in that show hoarders but the hoarder had ocd so it was slightly organized filthy crap the furniture in the back looked so sad i ca nt imagine any other goodwill in the valley accepting it most of it looked like it had been scavenged from next to dumpsters i did end up buying a few of the bags of cloth they have but only because they are for sewing projects and i knew i could dump them in the washer and sterilize the crap out of them when i got home i love going to thrift stores but this was slumming at a level i could not have imagined
it is just astonishing to think that a town which was once part of mxico ca nt manage to come up with any decent mexican food los olivos is all about sonoran style which is heavy and greasy but that aside there is nothing inventive about anything on the menu i ordered a shredded beef tostada and they did not bother to drained the boiled meat before assembling the thing my tostada was basically soup with overcooked beef tasteless vegetables and a very soggy tortilla and to top it off it was stone cold when it arrived with grease congealing i sent it back a replacement never arrived the margaritas were seriously overpriced and tasted like koolaid with something really bitter added to it but for me that was my dinner that night fortunately there is a sonic drivein not too far away which saved my evening even the chips were greasy and encrusted with so much salt that we had to use our fingers to rake it off the salsa is just average the decor is interesting and dalesque but i can get enough of a look by driving by and next time i will keep going how this place manages to stay open is a mystery but to be fair scottsdale does not set the bar very high for mexican food it s as if all of the owners get together monthly to review their crappiness scores to make sure nobody is doing it right and making the others look bad honestly taco bell is a better choice ugh
i went to heart attack grill after seeing it in the national nursing media headlines lrb they were putting this place down for creating a demeaningsexualized view of nurses rrb so of course i had to go and see what the fuss was about i walked in to the very small location to find only other tables with customers lrb older unhygienic obese men rrb the two waitresses on staff were less than appealing lrb and i m the kind of girl that can look at an attractive woman and admit it rrb and the cook behind the counter in the scrubsdoctor uniform looked like his clothes and hair had nt been washed in more than a week went ahead and ordered anyways their menu consists of burgers lrb single double tripple or quadruple bypass bugers rrb flatliner fries and soda but no diet soda oh you can also order a pack of camel filterless cigarettes if your stash is running low i ordered a single bypass burger flatliner fries and a coke the burger was subpar very greasy and the fries were soggy and half cooked the only positive thing i have to say is that i enjoyed drinking a coke out of a cold glass bottle i d rather go to hooters to see hot halfdressed chicks and i d rather go ummmmm anywhere else to eat
we regret to say we found the ristorante tuscany overpriced and underwhelming we went for the easter buffet the staff wrongfooted from the start as we were seated we noticed the chairs had not been cleaned crumbs and food debris were still on the seats next wrongfoot  the hostess advised us to order the entree before going to the antipasti and salad buffets the waiter arrive and told us to do the opposite the food was adequate and mildly disappointing an order of lamb arrived that was a disaster of fat and gristle  inedible at the price we paid that was unforgivable the much touted dessert buffet had only one high note  the almond brittle on the creme brulee we are now sorry we canceled a previous reservation at another restaurant to go to the ristorante tuscany
one of the worst hotels i stayed in anywhere during my spring training visit earlier this year almost every day i had trouble with the door key cards very poor decor also
well me and my friend from work tried this place out and others we talked to gave rave reviews both of us though walked away and were not impressed with the food at all the only thing that we both liked were the sweet potatoes i had the chicken fried steak and it was very salty then after a few bites was very very soggy and gelatinous i will not be coming back
i love their pizza but ever since the new owners have taken over it has been nothing but a disaster last night we waited almost hours for a pizza i finally called and they said their driver was pulled over by the cops and had his car towed so there was a delay so instead of making us a fresh pizza they delivered us the one that sat in the car for almost an hour they have no concern or care for their customers
went there for lunch place was not packed at all had an hour for lunch figured could have a good lunch across the street from work  not feel rushed we ended up having to get togo boxes for our food after min my order was missing rice that came with it not the biggest deal but really  also took a while to get the check i used to like this place not anymore will go back for drinks but this was my last time dining here
we ordered a couple pizzas tonight via their online system and were given an estimated delivery time of about minutes we thought this sounded quite short but were willing to give them a little leeway after they missed the estimated delivery time by minutes i called to see what the status of our pizza was alexa or alexis lrb not sure which rrb answered the phone and as soon as she pulled up our order she started apologizing profusely she put me on hold and after a few minutes another person answered the phone with much more of a gruff voice did nt say anything except this is  lrb did nt catch name rrb i figured the phone had been picked up by someone else so i told her i was talking to the other person she told me she was the manager and that the driver said he tried to deliver the pizza and the woman that answered the door told him they already got their pizza  since it s my wife and i that were home both expecting the pizza and both irritated that it had nt arrived there is no way that happened at this house i could nt tell if the driver messed up terribly or if this was their cover story for messing up our order and not getting it out granted they did offer to recook the pizzas and deliver them for free but at this point they are done in my book the last thing i want is a pizza cooked and delivered by disgruntled people this is the last time we will ever attempt to get a pizza from them and highly recommend you use caution when ordering
i used to love this yogurtology lrb see glowing review below rrb but now  i ll never be back over the past month and a half i ve gone to yogurtology times lrb i d be there more but i live a solid min away with no traffic  but it was really that good rrb during those visits i was treated rudely ignored and basically given the impression that my business was not wanted what happened  apparently the same boy works every single day i ve gone lrb and yes he s a boy obviously not even out of high school rrb he s rude often has his friends in the shop and is incompetent the high school students yogurtology used to hire were great  there was one guy in particular who was funny outgoing and gave the place energy but not anymore first time i went  no place to sit because this kidworker s friends had taken all the inside spots not only were they taking a bunch of free samples they were also loudly talking about how girls are all hoes and how ugly hoes are the worst  come on seriously  in yogurtology where there are children  second time  no place to sit because this kid had nt bothered off to clean off all the sticky tables i literally had to eat my froyo in the car because there was no clean place to sit this last time lrb today rrb  kid gave free samples to people lrb a small family rrb standing in front of us when my boyfriend and i walked up to ask him about trying the  spicy banana mango lrb because seriously who does nt want to sample that  rrb he ignored us and walked away behind the counter given all the other frozen yogurt shops closer to where i live this is an incredibly stupid move for yogurtology hire some real workers and fire this clown who obviously does nt care enough to do his job right i will never ever be back
will never be back and i do nt suggest this place to anyone there are so many places in scottsdale that serve fresh farm to table food and i would suggest going there if you want to get attitudes slow  horrible service all with a slice of could careless waitress personalities you ve come to the right place when entering a restaurant you expect to be greeted by the hostess instead of waiting for  minutes for her to get off the phone we were left standing awkwardly right in the front where the door entrance is as the restaurant space itself is rather tight with wall to wall tables ridiculous and absolutely inexcusable a fireable offense in my opinion but no one working there including the bartender who eyed us at least times never thought to signal someone to help us once we were seated we were told that they were no longer serving breakfast even though they are supposed to serve it until am and it was now am they absolutely would not make an exception when my husband gently asked the server if she could check with the manager and take into account that we had come especially for breakfast and were kept waiting she complied then came back and said sorry but the kitchen has switched over to the lunch menu and with that statement told us to look over the lunch menu and she would be back to take our order i was shocked we should have just left then as the service went downhill from there although i do nt have any complaints about the food  it was good but very pricey  but i can not emphasize enough the poor  slow service all with attitude i will never be back and susan  chef becky should be ashamed of themselves to allow these kind of servers to represent their establishment and to foster these snotty careless attitudes in their restaurant just remember many good restaurants have been brought to their knees by the employee help lrb or lack of rrb i do nt care how good the food
if i could give this place zero stars i would but i was forced to give one my husband and a few friends used to come to this place every week on tuesday night for trivia every night we would order food and at least one of us would drink recently we showed up for our normal trivia night and upon asking what i wanted to drink i said water it was cinco de mayo and i was probably going to have a drink but had nt made a choice yet the waitress then told me that they are only serving bottled water after five now what  you wo nt serve me water  i did nt get irritated at the waitress she did nt make the rules we just wanted to talk to the manager while waiting for the manager another tabled ordered water and were told the same thing they also wanted to speak with the manager the manager visited their table first and we listened in after talking with them for a bit he said well one of your party has ordered margaritas it s ok for you to get water from now on whenever you guys come in you can have water the manager then finished his conversation and came to visit us he talked with us about how he did nt like people coming to trivia and just ordering water lrb that is completely understandable rrb however when i told him the situation of us being frequent visitors and that we always ordered food he did nt seem to care he asked if we were sitting in the same area last week and i replied yes he then mentioned how he noticed we were drinking water and said this is a bar you ca nt order food and get free water we then walked out this bar does not serve you free water and on top of that their food is not that good and overpriced
we started going to the bird as we call it starting the second week that it first opened as time went on they just kept getting better and better we would go sometimes  time a week then they changed owners but wanting to give the new owners a chance we went a few more times in our opinion it went down the flusher they starting changing certain items trying to go on the cheap too bad why people buy a successful business then change things i do nt know the killer for us was on our th retry the bacon was no longer nice full pieces they were shriveled up tiny pieces that would fit inside a teaspoon spoon we said that s enough too bad several other friends that we had recommended to go there in the beginning has also quit going due to their changes do nt waste your time don vickie  andrew
i love their food but do not come to the scottsdale location i phoned in my order ahead to beat the lunch rush i get there not busy i though cool i walk up to the counter a girl comes up to counter looks at me do nt say anything to me so i was like i m here for an pick up order she said um hum and tell me my total turn around grabs my togo order i paid her she gaves me my changes tells me there is fork over there turns around and go into the kitchen not a how are you not a thank you not have a nice day nothing rude on top of that my meat was soo dry never never would i go back to this place again bad service bad food
horrid i will occasionally determine whether i will attend a show based whether my love for the band outweighs my disdain for the clubhouse some key points in no particular order staggeringly hot  i left the walkmen show early because i thought i was going to pass out lrb when the band onstage complains that it s hot they re probably not just making conversation rrb horrible sound especially if you are forced to stand in front of the speakers which is hard to avoid bathrooms  stifling inadequate and revolting beer sign that shines into the crowd and distracts from the acts on stage  annoying random discarded yard sale items stored in the bar area  really  ever heard of a storage room  the fact that you have to stand by the stickyfloored bar area far away from the stage if you re drinking  ridiculous why do bands play here  one of the great mysteries of the universe especially when there are places like the rhythm room nearby the only positive thing i have to say is the guys they have staffed at the front door are always friendly added bonus hope you enjoy taking your friend to the impound lot lrb it s across the street from tempe marketplace rrb because more than one of my friends has been towed from this lot before so if there s a sign warning you will be towed over the space you re parking in believe it
two of us went to centurion with a groupon for brunch we arrived at am and were told that we could not use the groupon and they would only honor it until am we asked if we could apply it to lunch and we got a firm no they said it was groupon s fault because it was supposed to state breakfast and they printed brunch that is nt our fault we went somewhere else for a late breakfast and happily gave them our money it is tacky and defeating to turn customers away we will never go back and we will be sure to tell everyone we know about this by putting things on groupon you stand a good chance of aquiring new and loyal customers turning people away is not a great way to build a customer base
really terrible experience we waited about a half hour to be sat for a party of which would nt be so bad if we did nt walk past empty tables on our way to be sat there were at least open tables in the restaurant while we were waiting our food took forever our appetizer came out with our meal and was cold our waitress was supposed to tell us about the gift cars deal which she did not and the card on the table said if they forget they d bring a free desert and it never came would nt return solely because the service was awful  victoria shaughnessy
bartender is beyond rude very racist my friends and i were the only brown people at the bar and he would not take our orders for dinner everyone else at the bar was white and they all had their food he was nt that busy i saw him go back and forth a few times with empty hands i did nt see him make any mixed drinks serving wine is nt rocket science or that hard even the host was a bad employee if there is a wait offer the bar apologize for the wait but never tell people you can go somewhere else you can tell this place is established because only a place that established can stay in businesses even with these type of employees will never go back or will never recommend this place to anyone
horrible it was nt even busy and it took the waitress minutes to come to our table when we arrived meanwhile she was standing at the counter playing on her iphone the food was the worst and we have eaten at different streets of ny before and loved their food bread was stale salad was nt fresh pizza was just ok the manager stood next to the bar the entire time playing on his phone i never plan to visit this location again and would nt recommend it to anyone
whoever runs this stadium has no understanding of baseball tradition or how to serve people food the concession stands were unbelievably slow it took and a half innings during a slow moving game to get a hamburger and coke what makes it unforgivable is that all the concessions are broken up by food so all that this concession offered was hamburgers there was no guessing what the next customer would order and the lines were huge hmm i wonder what the people are waiting in line for  in the th inning the stadium committed the ultimate sin for a ballpark they replaced  take me out to the ballgame for seventh inning stretch with  cotton eyed joe are you freaking kidding me  what a poorly run ballpark needless to say star
i love pizza i really do nt have a better way to start a review other than me sharing my love for pizza meat cheese and carbs all put together that also acts as its own servicing dish just seems genius to me i love vincent s pizza but their delivery service is awful i recommend either eating there or ordering pick up meal i usually order the smallest of the sizes with italian sausage and fresh mozzarella and cannolis taste vincent s has the best pizza and awesome cannolis their pizza is new york style and has the right amount of floppiness to it their ingredients seems to be top notch and fresh this is the real deal pizza out of value this is expensive pizza but i am probably the wrong the person to ask about this because once i find a pizza i love i will pay almost anything for it i wish they did serve a smaller size pizza for individuals lrb the fiance does nt care for new york style pizza rrb so that means you end up having a bunch of left over pizza out of servicecleanliness here is why they got one star their customer service is awful awful awful if you ask for a pizza to be delivered it takes well over two hours even though they will wuote you that it will take a little over an hour one two separate occasions the price given over the phone ends up being lower what you have to pay when it arrives to the door and finally ever single time you call them asking  where the heck is my pizza the managersowner always throw their own people under the bus instead of stepping up to the plate and being accountable service at the physical restaurant is nt that much better either out of atmosphere very generic decorating ca nt remember if there was music could use a major overhaul out of overall if the service was nt so god awful they would be my go to pizza place in the valley the taste is absolutely amazing it is in my top pizza places but the service is so completely awful the taste is nt work it points out of out of stars
i lived in mexico for six years and i have to say this place has some of the worst mexican food i ve ever tried i ve had better mexican food in hong kong the waiters are slow and leave a lot to be desired in terms of manners the food tastes like nothing more than grease with cheese
sold me the world s worst phone without telling me the droid was comming out in weeks stuck with a samsung sega for another months does all tech stuff great sucks as a phone ca nt hear drops calls repeatedly lrb could be verizon s network too rrb i ca nt wait to get rid of it and possible verizon too
ok take my review here with a grain of salt i m a total spa nerd and have probably been to at least that being said here we go massage very average massage we went here on a travelzoo day at the spa deal person the massage was quite average to bad its suppoed to be an hour we got mins of that mins of them at least were spent with the amssage therapist over at the sink doing god knows what i asked for a quad massage they were never touched during the massage mens locker room it s a gym locker room not a spa it has a lot of locals hanging out and if you are into a nice quiet spa with amentities and a spa feel you wo nt find it here the steamroom was nice the relaxation room was an afterthought and odd the hot tub is in a corner and completely ill placed if you like privacy while you change forget it everyone from the tv room can watch you change horribly designed place pool the actual spa pool is big enough for people to do laps thats about it so we used the resort pool just up the stairs went there for a couple of hours hoping to get drinks no chance no pool service amentities they had tea bags in the mens room with no hot water for it no lemon waters or lime juices etc like most spas would have coffee but that was also empty they have a jar of stale almonds in the tv room if you like that all in all this is one of the most disappointing spas we have been to which is very sad because we had heard good things when we told the manager about our experience the reply was an offer of  off our next time in why in the world would we come back  oh well sanctuary spa is officially the most overrated around
we ate here before going to see the sharkscoyotes game in march it was busy  most likely because of the biker rally and the hockey game  but we were seated in a reasonable amount of time i ordered a chicken ceasar salad which was very boring and run of the mill i actually did nt eat the chicken at all just because there was nt any flavoring on it and it was cold chicken perhaps if it was warm it would have been palatable about halfway through the meal i started to feel incredibly sick and started to get a headache i realized once we were done that a lightbulb high on the ceiling right above our table was flickering and it made me sick i did not bring my migraine medication with me to dinner and was forced to sit through a hockey game with a terrible upset stomach and migraine needless to say it pretty much ruined the game i would hope that the management would take better care of the building
i came in contact with this company via home depot communication was horrible my quote came a week later than they said and after i emailed them did it come a day later when i had questions i received a brief answer i felt after attempts of clarifying the quote that i was pulling teeth to get information it really should nt be that way i guess i m of the frame of mind that when someone wants to do business they try to be as professional and upfront as they can that they try to wow the customer with information so that they can make a decent and informed decision after all i would be the person paying them the way i figure it if a company ca nt perform very simple basic follow up follow through and professional communication at the start they re not going to be successful in managing a landscaping project until the end making sure that the customer is happy look they obviously did a few things right back in from the other reviews but they are not doing so well right now i passed on their services happily and knowing that i just saved myself a huge mega headache
service is the word or lack of it wow
god damn this place another hype restaurant let me tell you i showed up minutes after the opening of business hours i walk in  the f n staff is nt saying anything to me just walking back  forth finally i stare down some lady she looks at me  says were at capacity you need to come back in  hours if you want to eat you know what i do nt care how f n great this place is supposed to be because that is not good practice it s ridiculous  any moron who waits that long for food is f d up in the head you want good italian food in phx  you aint gonna find it here because once you drive west of the mississippi you lose the ethnic flavor  rich history of real italian food where you can achieve four star worthy dining at many local neighborhood eateries on a poor man s budget without the hype
this dry cleaner may be the least professional and poorly managed of any that i have ever been to i have had atleast bad experiences including poorno pressing on dry cleaned items items being returned without being cleaned however this last experience put a nail in the coffin i took one of my favorite work dresses here to be routinely dry cleaned lrb they had cleaned it previous times without a major issue rrb and it was returned to me completely ruined it had black ink ran all over the dress even so much that it was on the tag they attached to it i returned it to them told that it happens sometimes and then told i would be compensated it has been over a week and still no call from the manager with a resolution or time frame for reimbursement its clear that in this circumstance you get what you pay for
most people will try to tell you that zia records is the best record store in the valley those people would be correct why the low score then  because being crown prince of the turd playground that is phoenix s record store selection is not exactly a glowing accomplishment this store does several things wrong for one this location in particular pesters the shite out of you are you finding everything alright  are you finding everything alright  yes jesus christ i was finding everything alright the first four times you asked me now be a good little retail monkey and leave me the bloody hell alone so i can shop and eventually give you my money i m sure it s this economy business that s to blame and not necessarily corporate nonsense but someone needs to take their manager out back and explain that annoying the piss out of your customers may actually be worse than ignoring them and it s just this store i went to the tbird location and was nt bothered someone casually asked me if there was anything i needed and i said no and was done with it but at this store i was literally asked three separate times by the same idiot if i was finding everything okay perhaps it was the annoying tunes they had playing that added to the grating atmosphere censored rap lrb not that i m a fan but hearing the song go silent every five seconds to omit a blatant swear is fairly tiresome after awhile rrb s funk and bad butt rock seem to be on the menu ad nauseum though in fairness perhaps it s just the staff during the morning or something i notice at night it gets a bit better if you can crawl out from beneath all the employees asking you if you re doing okay long enough to even notice i ve never gathered the courage to stand in the line of leering meth addicts at the trade counter to tell you whether they give decent store credit for used stuff though so i ll leave it to greater minds to judge that facet of their business model i will say that their used stuff is in good enough shape if you do nt count the bleeding stickers they put on absolutely everything you inevitably spend twice the time you would have spent actually listening to your purchase doing nothing but peeling tape and stickers they re worse than gamestop that way i payed for it it s mine why are you putting your ugly stickers all over my album  bad neighborhood too i hate to sound so negative without balancing out with some positive but the experience is fairly fresh in my mind as i just went earlier today i guess their prices are good unless you want something newish in which case bending over and having plenty of lube handy is the best advice i can offer just know what you want go in get out and for god s sake avoid their overzealous employees as if they were landmines or just give the constant irritants a pass and go to a different location or bookman s i know i will
what is up with the owner if you re reading this are you like the sekong by night nazi  i reviewed stars for this restaurant and i get a whole novel backsass reply eventually you found us your mom should be proud what does my mom have to do with anything  what are you trying to imply  your restaurant was extremely difficult to find maybe you should get a bigger sign up because as you can read many yelpers have gotten lost  or stated that could nt find this place the soup did lack quite a bit of flavor it was bland it was actually a bland version of a wannabe vietnamese soup my mom could make at home the soup came out way before the dish sorry your butthurt because i do nt like your bland wannabe vietnamese soup i said it what are you gonna do about it  few meats on a stick a bowl of rice vegetables and a bland soup for bucks is expensive i really did feel jipped i did nt expect cambodian food to be this pricey especially being in central phoenix my bad i am comparing your prices to other asian restaurant in the area then again it was my first time actually at a cambodian restaurant and i was nt satisfied again do nt be butthurt about your sandwich i can in fact get it somewhere else for cheaper there are loads of vietnamese restaurants in central phoenix that do nt make their bread and also sell it for plus tax i do nt know why you are still calling your sandwiches cambodian sandwiches it may be called differently since it was sold at a cambodian restaurant but it s the exact same thing as a banh mi sold at a vietnamese restaurant lrb my bad because i did nt call it whatever you named it on your menu rrb but except yours is oversauced and very stingy on the meat why would i have to complain about my sandwich to you when i was there  should nt the staff know how to prepare the sandwich  am i a criminal for stating my opinion and experience on yelp  you make me feel like i am a criminal for yelping three stars which means aokay what did you want  five stars  the food was nt as good as it gets if you would reply saying sorry for being cheap and stingy on the meats then maybe i would want to actually return attention yelpers do not yelp lower than stars or the sekong by night nazi will come and get you again this is sarcasm do nt get butthurt get a life that is nt so focused on the bad reviews you get on yelp you have so many good reviews be happy about it your reply ticked me off so i had to reply even if it s been months later
food came out cold over cooked and not at the same time i would not bring kids back here due to the poor service and the rude staff
i ordered a cake well over a week in advance went to pick and they got it wrong how do you mess up one of two flavors  i ordered a chocolate cake and they made a vanilla they offered off when they should have called ahead and advised me that they were not going to make what i ordered they should have given the cake for free as it was not what i ordered and they even had a more expensive cake price than other stores but i decided to go with them because they had thomas the train lrb which came out not looking like it at all the only resemblance was the plastic train set on top the cake rrb way to go suckway on screwing up a little kids birthday cake
i ve heard about this place for the past years since i moved into the area and only tried it the other day it s okay and overrated in my opinion the food is mediocre the potatoes suck and everything tasted pretty stale to me soggy and stale and expensive could describe my meal we had the cheese omlette sweet potato fries biscuits and gravy and brought coffeecake and butter cookies back i tasted some of everything but the cheese omlette which was my order was really greasy and nothing special everything all together was but more than half the food was left on our plates we did nt even want to save it i will be ordering my omlettes from dennys or ihop from now on
i do nt get it bad service bad decor and over priced i d rather go to a ruth chris or morton s the bartender put ice in a year old single malt and when i told her you do nt do that she took the class and poured it into another glass keeping the ice wtf  am i taking crazy pills  she said everyone orders ice in their scotch yeah maybe if they re a year old boy and stole it from their dad s liquor cabinet
the mcmanager sucks lrb he would nt run his store safeway card for me rrb the debitcredit card swipers suck lrb they do nt fit in their holders and they must use a freakin dialup modem they are so god damn slow rrb they once completely ran out of milk their change machine was down for well over a week i swear to god if there were any alternative in the vicinity i d gladly pay twice the price to shop there revamped store is nice to look at shitty to shop at now with free wifi eat me
this establishment is now closed
this is not a complaint against just this particular walmart consumers beware i believed their ads about cashing checks for each i went to walmart to cash my payroll check lrb because my bank was closed and i need the to pay my rent rrb i put in my social security number and was refused of course they do nt tell you why  i m thinking it has to do with the company i work for turns out walmart will only cash checks for people with superior credit now should nt they say that in their ads instead of wasting my time finding a place to park and then waiting in line as customer service just to be refused  i was humiliated what does my credit have to do with cashing my payroll check  i will never step foot in walmart again
i hate jack in the crack the only time i can eat here is if i ve been drinking and everyone in the car is craving it not like i got a say i never drink and drive rrb so when we all pull up my drunken ass orders something this particular jack just is horrible the past times drinks get mixed up fries are missing tomatos are there when they should nt foods cold forget my sauce for the eggrolls lrb ya do nt judge i tried the eggrolls and they were horrible and dry and it s really hard to make eggrolls taste bad but jack in the box sure was able to do it
it was strange i had read a review with regards to budget today i had the same experience with a prepaid agreement through hotwirecom i used hotwire to bid and pay for the car in advance lrb approximately rrb the agent turned around and recharged me the amount plus an upgrade fee of about i was pissed off furthermore they would not help me with the child s seat in the car i did manage to contact me credit card company to have the charges reversed and was successful budget did not relent they wanted to recharge me the car rental plus an upgrade never again
never again lrb at least not for me this is a hotel for a different crowd rrb for me the best part about this hotel was that happy hour which lasts until serves glasses of decent wine but you can get that without having to stay here overnight i arrived to work being done on the outside of the hotel  apparently some rain damaged the drywall lrb huh  rrb so had to drive around the side to park where there is nobody to direct you to where the front desk is or heaven forbid be there to help you haul your bags up a flight of stairs later i learned that the elevator down there was nt just for parking  it could have taken me to the lobby so again it would ve been nice if there was sombody down there to let a newcomer know what is where not much in the way of hospitality  but then again this is a glorified holiday inn the lobby is okay in that it s very bright clean and somewhat hip the bar is off to the side where there is also a nice outdoor lounge like other yelpers i was a little confused by the two computers in the bar acting as the business center but whatever my room was pretty nice i liked the retro mid century look and feel this hotel s big selling point was the hard wood floors but in my opinion the floors were a huge mistake firstly they are cheap laminate not hard wood and anybody can tell but worst of all the floors make sound travel from room to room i was able to hear everything next to me and above me and on this random wednesday night my floor and the floor above me was an all night party  i mean college kids running up and down the halls like crazy people doors slamming lrb and i mean slamming rrb and what sounded like a game of marbles above my head this went on until in the morning i think that the low price point and hipsterish feel here makes it the perfect place for a twentysomething crowd but not a business traveler like me free internet and parking does not make up for the circles under my eyes so bottom line is if i were and partying with my friends this would be a fantastic hotel for work or a romantic weekend in scottsale notsomuch
after days of getting the runaround from multiple  managers i was told the part that was ordered did not come in and that it would be another days wait my car is no longer drivable due largely to the repeated mishandling of the idler pulley replacement i have requested a refund in full and will be taking my vehicle to another service save your money time and sanity stay away from this midas
i was nt even going to give one star but the mac  cheese was amazing as for the staff my suggestion is to get rid of the entire staff that is presently employed there and rehire all new people start over you would think that with a name like alice cooper behind you that the team would be amazing and go out of their way to have pride in their establishment and offer a good experience we went here before a rush concert in november and it was absolutely the worst customer service we have all four ever experienced and we are from tucson and were so excited to stop for drinks and dinner before our show the guy waiting on us was very impatient and very huffy complaining about the busyness and at the table next to us their waitress complained to her customers that she was very busy and would get them what they needed when she could while raising her voice about three levels horrible experience
let s start with this  my waiter was a year old guy with eyeliner caked on okay that s it you can find a better place to have a drink
keep on driving by i do nt understand the high reviews i ve been here twice just to check myself both coffee and espresso have no taste to boot wireless does not work well i had to use a neighboring business move on to the next place
i can hardly believe how highly rated this restaurantwine bar is i have been twice and both times was treated to high prices poor and condescending service and mediocre food once i ordered a veggie plate specifically because the menu stated that it included haricot verts when the plate came they were not on it i questioned the server and she said they were out of season but had not bothered to tell me in advance that the menu item would not be as described against my better judgment i went back a second time with a wine tasting group some political thing was to take place in the restaurant hours later it was being set up for so we were shunted to some tables we did nt want service was abysmal and the food and wine were really overpriced for what we received i will never go back
ok so it s a fast food joint  how wrong can they really go  i went in here on a tuesday afternoon around there was no lunch rush happening apparently this location has problems with people stealing napkins and ketchup because there were none of the self service stations where you can load up the person who took my order was incredibly rude there was no one in line behind me and she kept trying to make me leave her counter while i was still putting my credit card away she told me where i could stand and wait times they pour the soda there and she had managed to cover the outside of the cup with as much liquid as was inside oh and asking for a napkin to clean up her mess that s a big no no too as i walked away she proceeded to have a conversation with another employee about what a bitch i was for mentioning the sticky cup situation in spanish i speak spanish when they did toss my food at me i had to ask for ketchup and napkins they asked how many napkins i needed i would have asked for more if i had known that every table in their lobby would be filthy honestly i probably would have felt better about eating out back by their dumpster finally someone did come out to clean the lobby instead of wiping the table she simply swept up a cloud right next to me needless to say this had to be one of the worst burger kings i have ever been too
despite the fact that they tell you their beans are vegetarian and put them in the vegetarian burrito the original burrito company makes their beans with chicken stock this is false information they are providing to people and when people have moral issues with consuming meat this turns into a huge issue i will never eat here again i do not support businesses that are dishonest
regrefully few choices for dining at terminal b phoenix airport so reviewed the menu at arizona roadhouse and selected a salad as a tasty and healthy choice horrible why did it come to the table so quickly  probably because it was premade the stale bland tasteless way that it tasted i did not expect gourmet but then i did nt expect something to taste like a day old salad prepackaged for a b rate super market to grab a healthy lunch to go to eat at work just horrible wait service was nt as bad but pretty inattentive and indifferent and no unlike some of the reviews there seemed to be ample wait staff on hand i saw another customer order a salad to go and it was hard to resist the temptation to warn her i later chatted with her at the gate and she had the same reaction to her salad but threw hers away i asked the wait person if they had a form for customer satisfaction survey he said they did not but i could go online well now i have
kudos to the omelette maker and the waitress however i m not sure why it was so difficult for four hostesses to find me a decent table overall the food was okay not that great of a selection for per person though the bread table had a great display but was inevitably just there for looks and stale i m a vegetarian and tend to look for healthier options like fruit and a nice salad bar which was not offered i do nt recommend this place at all the cigarette smell from the casino seriously kills the appetite
well i was gonna write a review of this dump but then i saw aaron a s review and think it d be better just to repost his horrible review lrb how s that for a first line of a review aaron a  rrb i would not step back in this place for a taco fatty pork is fine if its cooked nicely but this was not green beef was ok as long as i piled the pretty good tomatillo salsa over it the fish let s leave it at ugh if this is their specialty it s over already lrb no more lines waiting i see that much rrb this is sunnyslope and with the authentic delicious taco and burrito choices around here this place is only competing with the tacos across the street at jack in the box and i would probably eat those before i d touch another one of these it was that bad for me sorry hippies this was nt good if you are going to come into a mexican part of town you d better bring the meat to compete you are far outclassed in tacoland lrb bold mine rrb so after some thought i decided rather than just pan the place i m giving suggestions use a paper or wax paper between the aluminum and taco or you have a mess do something with that too cold cabbagecheesetomato grill the fish and do nt smother it  chop it up make sure its fresh get a better cut of pork go organic lrb maybe it is rrb season it better keep the happy people in front they were nice do nt blend your lemonade with ice it was awful and too sweet quit buying your chips at costco those round ones suck do something with the guacamole it was ok just being avocado and lime but it was pureed keep it chunky get more input from your mexican chefs they probably know what is wrong both the red and green salsas were good just need a taco to go with it  be sure to look for all the flies they have in the kitchen during the summer months ugh horrible food
 cents to fax five pages to my insurance company and an unpleasant unsmiling troll behind the register to help me out with the process i think that pretty much sums it up
the food was fresh and hot but the place was a mess i went today lrb tuesday rrb at it was not busy at all and employees were taking a break the tables were dirty the floor was a mess the drink area smelled funny and the salsa bar needed cleaning uprefreshed what was worse was that two employees went to get drinks but did not bother seeing straw wrappers and peppers on the floor by the drinks and salsa bar it is sad when i have to go to a place to wipe my own table down
first of all i should say i go into a restaurant wanting to love it it is very hard to make me never want to return  i am a food lover early my husband and i received a gift card to this restaurant so we took my sisterinlaw out it ended up being embarrassingly bad and we felt really bad for taking her here our server was so rude he was very unprofessional and acted like he did not want to be there i wish i could remember his name but i did not bother to write it down i recently turned so was excited to try a new drink i ordered a red apple martini and he brought me a green apple martini i do not like to send anything back so i thought i would give it a try and i ended up not liking it i flagged him down and let him know that i had received the wrong drink he said to me are you sure  and tried to convince me that i had ordered the green martini it was very awkward because i knew lrb and everyone at my table knew rrb that i had ordered the red martini i asked if i could please just get the red one as the green one was not very good he reluctantly took it away and then returned to our table several minutes later in a quiet voice he said hey if my manager asks tell him you changed your mind or i will get in trouble overall the experience was horrible there were long gaps in time that our waiter was no where to be seen and at one point we had to get the attention of another waiter for water refills a customer should never have to ask for a refill after their cup has been empty for minutes it was very rude the food was nothing special did not leave an impression we had planned to be there for an hour at the most but from the moment we walked in to when we left it was over hours the length of time of the meal should be dictated by the customer not by bad service we felt very silly for having gone there most restaurants strive to give the customer an experience that they will want to return to this restaurant did not give us that experience at all very unfortunate
extreme warning about this business james rogers is a complete salesman that ca nt back up quality or his commitments i overpaid on a contract for sub par work that still has nt been completed while still waiting for completion lrb a month past committed completion date rrb on march rd he finally informed me that he was out of business since march th conveniently he had made another charge to my credit card on march th since then i have talked to multiple people that are all looking for money from him beware of james rogers and sun rock kitchen and design i could deal with the missed timelines and subpar work but this guy s lack of ethics remains completely unacceptable
we had to change rooms on the first night huge roach on top of the microwave the second room was so dusty i had a miserable night when we addressed our issues to sandra at the front desk  she told me that i needed to reserve a nonallergic room translations rooms they actually dust and clean i was sneezing all night i do nt have this problem under typical conditions the first room also had trash and hair clips left behind from the previous patrons sandra did not offer a solution or seemed too concern later that night i voiced a concern to a man at the desk and he offered an additional night that was kind of him though the problem was i could nt breath and was sneezing needless to say we did nt take the offer before i forget to mention one of the sofa chairs upholstery was torn i do have pics to back up my claims after our second room was recleaned we had to dust our selves the last night i could nt sleep because i m certain i felt bed bugs i googled them from my phone after seeing the huge cock roach i was to scared to check for the bed bugs in the mattress as advised from the website which brings me to their wifi you have to pay for it pretty chinsey to charge for wifi lrb about  day rrb however some of the down stairs desk computers face the windows entering the hotel they use their wifi for staying on facebook all day there was nt one time as i was entering  leaving for the day that i did not see an embassy suite s staff face book page up lol i guess the wifi is for their staff other then the rooms the overall stay was ok restaurant service was very kind and friendly they have a nice serve to order breakfast bar manager s reception at night with snacks and drinks the view from our suite was beautiful over looking the pool and golf course they need to work on the cleanliness of their rooms especially since that s what they pride them selves on firing sandra would be a good move
there are no car washes in the area except this one you have to put exact change in the machine and it never takes bills you have to go inside to get a code to use the wash which is inconvenient why does nt the machine want to take your money i have no clue this car wash could be making a lot of money given it s location but it s junk i will never give this gas station my money again
out of business
obviously if your drivethrough line wraps around the building and impedes traffic in the parking lot blocking access to other businesses you are way too slow
the saying wash your veggies before you eat them takes on a whole new meaning for me today the lettuce in my taco tasted like dish water the taste was an instant turn off i no longer go in to eat as the overwhelming smell of bad meat hits you as you walk in the door the beans on the nachos reminds me of mud and tastes about the same truly a fast food place with increasingly nasty food every time i go
i never wrote a mean review before but unfortunately i had to for this particular olive garden my family owns a restaurant and i am exceptionally sympathetic to servers and kitchen staff but i could nt even offer that with this restaurant i took one of my best friends out to lunch yesterday and had an awful experience while we were there it took a few minutes for our waitress to come to our table but that is never a big deal to me when she came to take our drink orders we asked for lemon water and a cherry coke that is a total of two drinks  why did it take longer than minutes to receive  then our food we ordered an appetizer lrb stuffed mushrooms rrb and as common sense goes appetizers should be the first order to the kitchen so you can munch while waiting for your main entrees that did nt happen our appetizer took over minutes to arrive and for most people i get irritated when i m hungry still i was incredibly polite to her because i know what it feels like to be a waitress lrb even if it s my family s place rrb i think our server is one of those people who might not care to satisfy friendly customers  they take advantage of kindness and give priority to customers who are screaming and yelling instead to not continue this long rant our entrees did nt show up for another thirty minutes i asked about the wait two times and she said verbatim yeah i do nt really know what s taking so long i forgot to put the order in but it still should nt take this long for lasagna that was unprofessional and i asked to speak to a manager at that point but surprise surprise the manager never showed up and we had to wait an additional minutes before we decided to forget about it and leave i did nt forget though it was supposed to be a nice lunch with a friend and because i did nt get to speak to a manager i had to put a review on yelp
i have given this place so many chances over the past year or so to get it together on their poor service you would think with as many reviewers complaining about slow and disorganized service it would improve by now but wow was i wrong i think it has actually gotten worse i went back because the food is good most times and the atmosphere is great but i have lost my patience now and not going back not only was the service slow this past time for lunch but the food runners confused orders and brought the wrong dish out this happened to table next to us too the most disturbing part was when i sent back the grilled cheese which i did nt order i told the food runner i had touched it eaten a few fries before realizing it was wrong dish and she picked it up and went t o got set it down at table next to us i had to tell her you can not now give it to another patron after i ate off the plate yikes i could nt believe she would have thought nothing of doing that so last straw this time i will not be back the owner obviously cares more about cutting corners to save money as they are always short staffed and even ran out of glasses serving our drinks in plastic cups until dishes got washed that is just being cheap stupid in the long run too because i do nt see how people will continue patronizing this place when there are so many glaring problems
this is one of the weirdest places i ve ever been i took some folks there that were in from out of town and staying at the sheraton they have a separate waitress for drinks and food it is cash only and they asked us to pay before we had even finished eating the waitresses did nt have much upstairs either they offered an allucan eat rib special then told us after we got our nd half rack that they were out of ribs and who knows where the hell the people in there crawled out from which is probably why it is cashonly they must have dine and dashers needless to say it didnt leave the most solid impression of phx on my guests
eeew it started with a cranky waiter who told me that if i wanted to know the specials then i should have read them on the board the food was downhill from there the entire place smelled like fried onions
if you want to loose weight this is the place to eat pretty much everything that was served to me remained on the plate at the end of the meal the coffee was pitifully undrinkable  i even tried adding cream and sugar and still could not take it my egg whites were raw  runny and gross and the home fries were cubes of boiled potatoes thrown onto the grill for seconds to give them the appearance of something breakfastlike the bacon portion was sizable  four big pieces the only problem was that it tasted like greasy salt  none of the smokey meat flavor you get with good bacon i would have sent my plate back but the no substitutions written ad nauseum across the menu and the fact that we were seated in front of the kitchen and i saw who was preparing my food made me think better of it  nuff said
this place is terrible if you want to eat mediocre food pay a lot of money and leave hungry then this place is for you i arranged a dinner with some out of towners and wanted to take them somewhere i have nt been before yelp has always been a reliable resource so i looked up highly rated restaurants and found the nobuo at teeter house first off the wait staff was fail the guy we had could nt pronounce most of the items on the menu we ordered the pork belly buns lrb overly fatty rrb curry lamb chops lrb burnt rrb okonomiyaki lrb bland rrb parchment wrapped fish lrb unoriginal rrb the only dishes i did enjoy was the duck breast salad and the new year s special foie grau needless to say dollars for a mediocre dinner left a bad taste in my mouth and my guests unimpressed i will never go back to this place
liars i waited for minutes with my son last night at the store at tatum and shea to be told that they were out of stock on the razr cell phone they called this store at frank lloyd wright and scottsdale rd  manager travis  to hold the phone for us first thing when this store opened at am we were there  my excited little son by my side i verified that the phone was oh yes then they started ringing us up the phone was not they would nt honor the  it had gone off special a couple of weeks ago travis the manager did nothing but jeer at me they told me i could use my phone s upgrade credit toward the phone i continued to ring out  they then charged me another thirty dollars for upgrading their new policy i would have walked out except i did nt want to disappoint my son since this was a gift he had been waiting all summer for verizon absolutely sucks and so do their nonunion employees no wonder their profits are so high  they are liars and rip off artists
drove all the way to sun city to find out this business is out of a garage  and they warranty  like how do i know you will be here in a year  needless to say did i not do business there wish i would have known as a waste of a drive are the other reviews really true or written by owner you decide
the last two times we have been there the girls are in the back trash not emptied yogurt grates were filthy three guys laying in chairs hanging out with the girls this is close to our house but we will not go back there is that feeling that this place is dirty also the last time the yogurt was like soup my best advise is go someplace else
so i fly a lot nearly miles in the past months not usually us airwaysamerica west  only maybe or times with them but my only horrible airline experiences have both been with them which is quite a ratio flew from san diego to portland meeting up for a monthlong concert tour i had my personal things as well as musicsound equipment of course when i land my luggage did nt after spending at least an hour trying to get baggage services to help me  they say my luggage is on the next flight and they will have a courier deliver it to me i make abundantly clear that i will meet the courier and have it personally handed to me  i do nt want it left with securitystaffanyone else lrb we were at a large rock venue rrb they promised to call as soon as my luggage landed and again when the courier was en route and they would only deliver to me personally of course no call and i called every hour on the hour till in the morning lrb when we left for the next city on the tour rrb  and could nt get an answer or a call back not only did they not call me as promised or return any my calls they apparently did deliver my bags but just left them on the door of the venue  exactly what i had stressed not to do i found this out the next day after calling repeatedly  when we were already in another city nobody signed for them even never saw my bags again lost a ton of important gear i needed for work and was screwed and then  a huge a huge fight with them over the claim they dishonored the claim for a while since they said they delivered them to the address i specified  despite having a promise in writing to deliver to me by hand then they said my claim was with the courier company not the airline then they did nt want to cover anything but clothing and hygiene items flew from st louis to flagstaff had a layover in phoenix  which is only like a hour drive from flagstaff the flight in phoenix was delayed several hours  but they did nt announce the delay until minutes to boarding  and kept delaying it by just minutes at a time finally once we board we are told the flight may be not be able to land in flagstaff due to bad weather the kicker  they wo nt send us back to phoenix  we would be diverted to palm springs california  and since it was an act of god  we were on our own they were nt responsible for lodging return airfare refunds ground transport  nothing so  the whole plane is already pissed about being delayed so long and now this nobody wants to take the chance of being flown to another state and getting stuck  so literally all but maybe people deplane and mill around the tarmack then we find out that we can choose not to take the flight but if we checked baggage  we ca nt retrieve it it s going to either flagstaff or palm springs with or without us so some people start to get back on the plane and others are arguing on the tarmack about what to do about their bags i spot our bags just sitting in the open cargo door of the plane and lead a small army of angry passengers to the back of the plane and we just grab our bags that were in plain sight the flight attendant tried to stop us  but realized that people were pissed and we greatly outnumbered them i ended up just renting a car and driving the hours to flagstaff and apparently flights to flagstaff had been canceled all day  but they neglected to tell us that at least they could have given a headsup to us so that we could have not waited nearly hours on flight delays and driven ourselves there much faster no apologies no refunds nothing i primarily fly either united southwest or jet blue no horror stories from them  while yes they ve lost a bag here or there they ve always been professional and prompt in getting it to me
the food was bland i think they poisoned me too if you value your life do nt go here
wow what a change in year we had a great time a year ago when we celebrated my birthday there decided to book again despite all the negative reviews they told us over the phone we would have a room by the pool with a private patio we were on the first floor no where near the pool and our patio was nt private it was open and most people were walking through it as a shortcut rather than following the sidewalk they keys did nt work so we took this as a sign that this room was nt for us they offered us another room closer to the pool upstairs no balcony or patio but that s fine we got up there and there was a pair of goggles under the entertainment center from previous guests that we noticed right away little hairs in the shower tub and even though we tried to ignore it all the last straw was the long hairs on our pillows as we got in the bed to sleep we called fd and they offered us a refund we are now celebrating our year anniversary next week at a different resort
asked for a manager at this store location associate called and manager asked what is needed associate guest would like to speak to you manager regarding  she eventually came and spoke but had no excuse why no associates were servicing the fitting room and long checkout lines were building customer service had a long line and there were plenty of associates that could had assisted the front of the store the manager needs some respect to customers and store associates need to be team coworkers instead only doing what their walkie talkies suggest them what to do i say suggest because it seems the store associates and manager do nt take the communication device seriously enough
worst pizza i ve had in the state of arizona no wait ever i work in a hospital and i d rather eat the dried out cafeteria pizza any day over this crap i dont know who decided it was a good idea to change the name of the business on yelp lrb it used to be zzzzas pizza rrb instead of closing zzzzas and opening a new business as piza but it was a terrible idea now it looks like piza pizza has much better reviews than it does do nt be fooled i walked in and the owner was short with me and rude when i asked him what kind of pizzas he had fresh for me to buy a slice he told me he had every kind of pizza ready huh  so i ordered a piece of sausage pizza and watched as they threw some sausage on an old piece of pizza and sent it into the warmeroven it came out hard as a rock nasty also it s the month of june in arizona and degrees outside it s about degrees inside this place he had the doors propped open and the ovens on looks like someone s a cheap ass trying to save on ac costs who the heck would want to dine at your restaurant 
if i were to name this restaurant with only one word it would be blah everything was just there when you burp after you eat at sauce it does nt even have a flavor it is that bland i wasted minutes and that i will never get back again on this sorry excuse of an eatery
they really need to get a better drivethrough speaker i had to repeat my order times after waiting several minutes to even get someone to take my order when i went to the window my order was still wrong which was then fixed i got home to discover that even with the correction at the window they gave me the wrong shake i ve had problems ordering from this drivethrough almost every single time i ve been here but this was the last straw never planning on ordering from here again
i always try to give this ups store my business for its close to home but every time i ve been in the employees always have a chip on their shoulder  dude i m just trying to mail something and its your job to help me get that done terrible customer service they could be a lot nicer i prefer to use fedex but sometimes i need to use ups so i will go to the other ups store on indian school from now on  they are super nice  should nt every store be like that
i would have liked this place if i were still yearsold but probably not even then imagine some sort of weird red lobsterjoe s crab shack setting but filled with bingedrinkers from the worst of the scottsdale and tempe crowd the perfect example of a gimmicky establishment that tries far too hard i ve given this place one or two reviews in the past but like others here my reviews were also flagged and deleted by the community lrb read the owner rrb oh well
i spent almost dollars replacing my tires as soon as the car was ready i got in the car had noticed my antenna was broken i brought it too their attention and the manager said he would go through the camera footage to see if an employee had damaged it while replacing the tires he called me back later and stated he found no footage of that i just bought my car less than a month ago and i know what is wrong and not wrong my antenna was just fine until after the tires were replaced at this establishment manager refused to take responsibility other then paying half of the cost to have the antenna replaced i spent another too have the antenna replaced i will never go there again
protech is a horrible company their customer service is the worst i ve run into in a long time they decided today that yelling at me and then transferring me to a tech is acceptable behavior for a business to have i would not recommend them to anyone
closed  i swear this was just open last week i placed an order online and did not get a call back within minutes per their online order confirmation i figured they were just busy with the lunch rush so drove over anyway dark locked up furniture removed sadly the now open sign is still up too bad seemed like a good concept
i wish i could give this avis negative stars terrible service did nt get the car i made a reservation for rude staff not only that they gave me an explorer with over miles on it breaks that grinded to the point i felt unsafe and the car was terribly dirty inside the worst of all though sitting in the cup holder was a bullet casing when i returned the car and let avis staff know they just laughed they also tried to charge me for the rate of the explorer which was double the price of what i had booked they acted like they were doing me a favor by giving me the rate on my reservation avoid avis hertz is a million times better
is it the water  my wife dragged me to this place maybe five times before i finally said enough the food and service was poor each time i tried different items on the menu and they all tasted the same lrb like not good cafeteria food rrb the atmosphere is ok if you sit by the water they have a nice mexican tap beer selection lrb the best in chandler unfortunately for me rrb and this place is crowded too so somebody likes it i just do nt get it
i ordered some long john silver food the food was cold and as i drove all the way to my hosue i found out they gave me the wrong order plus the lady at the drive thru window was rude
just not good ordered wings which came with sides i chose macncheese and refried beans wings were fried slightly overcooked and had no flavor no salty no seasony nothing macncheese tasted a couple of elbow noodles swimming in warmed cream with a tablespoon of actual cheese plopped in the cup refried beans were soupy and slightly undercooked also ordered a wing drumstick thigh which came with sides which were chosen as fries and corn on the cob the man agreed his chicken was also slightly overcooked no salt no seasony nothing fries were that cool spiral cut concept but were chewy greasy and soggy corn was corn haha i was hopeful that they would have a different style of fried chicken like at pollo campero eek methinks not at the end of the meal we came to the consensus they got everything they attempted wrong absolutely wrong im sad for them lrb and sad for my dollars i didnt even wanna write this review however i know this is exactly what yelp is for i took one for the team tonight we win most and we lose some i definitely lost tonight update weird how all the reviews for this place are yelped by randoms with only review and sound like advertisements haha weird
petsmart groomers are serious losers they ve lost the paperwork twice they called a phone number i did nt give them  twice so it s not their fault they ca nt get in touch with me right  pay big extra to get the nails trimmed and they do nt trim the nails on the back feet they use a choking collar on dogs while grooming so now two of my dogs have trachea problems if you hate your dog and do nt value your time this is the perfect place to learn where huffers go after rehabilitation
it s about person and the portions are small so you will probably feel hungry lrb and robbed rrb an hour later unless of course you are my parents and had the raw sandwich then you will be up all night with food poisoning
the arizona humane society does not rate in my opinion i would recommend that animal lovers support any of the other worthy animal welfare organizations
i avoid this place they play extrememly loud music on saturday nights till am i will not go there until they change their practices
reservations are needed to sit at the bar  we attempted to stop in for a drink on the patio on may th and were surprised to find people sitting at the tables but the entire outdoor portion of the bar empty except for a single person it turns out that the person sitting at the bar was a waitress who informed us as soon as we sat down that we were not allowed to sit there because she was saving the seats for the people on the list i inquired as to what list this was and she told me that we would need to get on the waiting list if we did nt have a reservation at that point i expected to hear rod serling s voice as i thought i had actually entered the twilight zone i mean seriously this is by no means a posh or swanky restaurant it is a casual restaurant that offers happy hour at which no one in their right mind would think it necessary to wait on a list to sit at the bar we got up and went and sat at what i could only describe as a counter or ledge on the side of the patio at which we had sat the previous afternoon while we were having a glass of wine the redhaired manager promptly walked over and told us that we need to register and put our names on the list and could not sit there i asked what had happened since we did nt need to be on any list the day before but he offered no explanation and rudely insisted that we register with the hostess needless to say we left and will not return the only halfway decent aspect of renegade is their outdoor patio bar and if that is not usable without an undue hassle there really is no reason to go there we had previously had dinner there and i honestly think that we could have gone to denny s and gotten a better meal we each ordered a salad and the lobster tacos which our server raved about and highly recommended the salad was made with iceberg lettuce and some other nondescript items that had seen fresher days but the truly puzzling element was the red onion vinaigrette dressing which looked and tasted like nothing more than a combination of red food coloring and some sort of a gelatin as for the tacos this is certainly not the type of place where one would expect high quality maine lobster so i was expecting some sort of mediocre warm water lobster that would have been a treat compared to the heavily breaded greasy globs of what had to be cod or some other type of inexpensive whitefish as there was not even a hint of lobster taste present the tacos themselves were sopping with a smoky flavored chipotle sauce and had a bit of shredded cabbage thrown in as an afterthought needless to say i did nt even finish half of that dish despite being very hungry when we d arrived we had written the place off as a potential dinner destination after that horrific meal but since we live fairly close by thought we could still stop in for a drink but clearly we were wrong on that front too i truly ca nt see this place making it through the slow summer months if they continue to drive away business with their bizarre policy of making a reservation or registering on a list to sit at the bar one can only hope that their demise will be quick and a worthwhile restaurant will move in to take their place
this place is full of apparently inexperienced young girls who butchered our maltipoo s cut recently they told me he needed to be shaved due to matting  did nt realize that meant a cut that is totally uneven with some areas shaved down to the skin and other areas somewhat puffy also the insides of his ears were bright red when we brought him home apparently from the shaving and overzealous plucking that was done our dog was shivering and shaking and would nt leave his crate for days after this episode when i called to complain i got nowhere with the girl on the phone she certainly did nt offer any explanation or a refund as their guarantee states bottom line find someone who s more experienced and less agressive for your dog s sake
my friend suggested we celebrate my friend s birthday here what a mistake the table was akward for people to see each other but hey we did nt make a reservation the sad part is that two of us ordered the fajitas lrb including the birthday gal rrb the food arrived and sat next tto our table for well over minutes by the time the waitress came to serve our food it was cold lrb although we commented on how when the fajitas had first arrived they were not making a sizzling sound rrb the waitress appeared upset that we were wanting our food at least worm vs cold she took it to the kitchen and brough back fajitas that had been stuck in the over food was hot but now way overcooked i wont be returning to this place anytime soon  with some many other great choices i m sorry my friedn chose this restaurant
  loud had to be the loudest restaurant i have ever been to  food on par with chili s or applebee s nothing special  service waiter was nice but very rushed and stressed  view the view is excellent if you can get it personally i will not go back again
the majority of reviewers do nt lie it really was that bad this event spread like wild fire i had family members and friends talking about this event from the getgo me and my bf arrived around to a stand still at the parking entrance cars in front of us were uturning their way out of there so we did the same and parked in a nearby field walking up to the event the lines looked ridiculous come to find out i would wait over hours at the taco truck not cool i waited by myself while family and friends waited in other lines my sister s kids played corn hole and some chose not to wait in line at all and grab something on the way home the variety of games was the best part great free activities for all ages to take part in so food wise my tacos were good even though i arrived on an empty stomach the tacos were nt overly fantastic or even worth the wait i got the veggie chicken and beef taco i shared and we all agreed the chicken taco was the winner would i wait hours for those tacos again nope my friends graciously shared their fried bread and funnel cake with the group and that was really good wonderful idea poor execution maybe next time it will be better
chicken enchiladas were terrible  could tell they were cooked and left to reheat under a heat lamp it was boiled chicken with no flavor wrapped in soggy tortillas with a pretty standard cheese sauce the rice tasted like it was microwaved the waiter kept leaning over me instead of walking to the other side of the table he did nt replace the silverware from dinner when we ordered dessert disappointing food and service
decided to check this place out because they had a good deal on grouponnow very unprofessional and unorganized look just because you are an aesthetician does nt mean you can run a business this particular establishment is a prime example i bought the grouponnow which is only valid for a time specified for one day in this case i had until pm to redeem i tried calling all morning to schedule an appt no answer so i just went down there walked in rang the bell heard some ladies chatting in the back after waiting for mins i finally walked into the back and said hello  finally the owner came out and said they were closed closed  i informed her that she had a grouponnow running that day she apologized and offered me a free treatment for my inconvenience i appreciated that and left when i called back to schedule they said they were booked up for the next month today i saw another grouponnow for them and decided to call and see of they had any openings this time at least someone answered the phone she told me they were booked up the next month what  i m just confused as to why this business keeps running grouponnow specials that people can not redeem  a med spa needs to be staffed and organized before they open their doors this business is an unprofessional disaster i hope people check yelp before buying groupons to socalled med spas
do not take your car here they put new tires on my car instead of and it took hours instead of crediting me or fixing it right then because they did not have time gave me coupons for a free oil change i brought my car in for an oil change at in the morning and at it was still parked in their lot untouched they lack professionalism and are extremely rude to customers
came in at am place seemed ok pedcure price was good picked out my nail color as i headed to the back i started to notice that the place was filthy walked by a waxing room that looked like someone slept in it goldfish crackers computer on bed messy blankets  pillow went into the restroom and found dirty dishes from food in the only sink i could nt even wash my hands thoughts of my toes swelling up with infection ran thru my mind needless to say i left quickly gross place wish i could give it negative stars
the sandwiches here are very overrated all bread very little meat the service is poor take your business elsewhere
bad service noisy plane is not maintained clean they do not prep the plane well mechanically thus our flight broke down in tokyo wonderful we all had to be bussed to the middle of nowhere in japan where all forms of communication were severed w  our families lrb we passnegers had no local currency rrb
i ve been to this zipps times first time was fun second time i ordered the wings and i ended up with food poisening and the last time i went they overcharged my bill and forced me to deal with the asshole gm the food is great at zipps and goldies but not at this location and the management are idiots and condisending assholes i do nt recommend this location at all
great in theory  not so much in reality overheard someone say they were hoping for  originally but by pm well over had come crazy traffic sat forever on pima parking on top of ticket prices and food costs lines were ridiculously long by the time we got in the gate at am we saw no map or details of where each truck waswhat was available at each truck well over minute lines at manymost trucks we only got to buy samples from then waited for tyler florence demo tyler was scruffy bearded did nt look well and the sound did nt work at first after he was almost minutes late starting the pulled pork sandwiches he made lookedsounded yummy he had good energy with the crowd but seemed like he was rushing samples were all gone by the time our place in line got up to the demo area though so we did nt get to sample his food lrb best truck we tried cupcakes com from tucson had yummy cupcakes red velvet and peanut butter cup rocked their regular large ones are the same price in tucson lrb got small versions for at the event rrb yum yum yum though nice live music too next year some shaded areas that are not vip would be nice more regular and ongoing food demos menusmaps and better parkingtraffic flow please this year it was an experience but not a good value by any stretch
gross xp i had lunch here with an office group at a coworker s recommendation it reminded me of panda express i ordered the catarpiller roll for it took forever to arrive which was ironic for a fast food place if i have to wait minutes for a roll i d rather get good sushi my food was served in a styrofoam box and it was disgusting it was warm and squishy and fell apart when i tried to pick it up with chopsticks my friends ordered teriyaki bowls for a little more than i tried some and thought the meat was dry and the teriyaki sauce was sloppy the portions were small and not worth the price i will never go here again
we went to fiddlesticks on saturday evening there were of us the price was a person but i had some entertainment book coupons so it was for the course was terrible the turf on the course was ripped in places  there were lots of ants i found a few insects and bugs in the hole of the course we had fun but would nt go back to that course
i too am also a fan of other fox concept resturaunts but sauce was extremely disappointing had seen the location at the scottsdale water front but never seemed enticed enough to enter until the other night my cousin and i met up at a central location and unfortunately this seemed like the best option in the norterra lot he had a pizza which for my opinion are overpriced for their quality and size their menu does nt span much tastebuds but can get any general idea of a classy pizza across it was burnt and too crispy even for just a plan pepperoni and cheese it was boring torn between wanting some pizza and a salad i ordered their greek ish salad which was pretty good although it was delicious the salad was way to rich to eat entirely by one s self i was mostly turned off by their service of wine in what appeared to be a juice cup maybe thats fine for my kitchen but thats at home where it does nt cost per glass my mom informed me later that in a juice cup is actually how they drink it ususally across the atlantic hmp did nt know that all in all do nt think i ll be getting sauced with sauce again
this place is a joke they are completely inept to handle any group larger than people unable to accommodate our large group they offered the option of family style sounds like a good idea right  wrong they brought out what i assume to be their regular sized portions for everyone to share family style implies that it feeds more than one person they do nt need to be bucca lrb disgusting btw rrb sized but geesh on top of all that they do nt even serve fountain drinks the only serve natural products get over yourself i d rather go buy a frozen stoffer s and bake it and serve liters than ever go to this disaster of a place again
my wife and i ate here last night and were enthusiastic upon entering the restaurant after hearing and reading all the hype about this chain but what a major disappointment we ordered a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms grimaldi s is very proud of their pies with a sticker price on a basic large cheese toppings are each so with invested in the pie we were hoping for a really good taste we like our pizza a little extra crispy and ordered it that way but it came out chewy like a piece of jerky upon inspection  i pulled the cheese and topping layer off the crust  we saw a gummy crust that looked like a glazed donut a total turnoff also the sauce was tasteless and the cook skimped on the toppings i ve eaten a gazillion pizzas in my day and this pie gets a letter grade of an f for starters we tried the house salad and at best it was very average the ingredients were nt choppedprepared professionally and the dressing was bland we mentioned our disappointment to our waitress and she had the manager come over to speak to us we pointed out the gummy undone crust and he took  off the pizza and said he hoped we d give his store another try but nothing turns me off more than unjustified hype and grimaldi s gets way too much credit for basically no reason i think i ll stick with oregano s or heck even peter piper has way better pizza
first i m going to call out several of these fake reviews and welcome any newbie yelpers to be my  friend but i know it wo nt happen secondly within a two mile radius two indian food restaurants closed within a year one just a month ago and three new indian restaurants have opened you have to either question the intelligence or admire the huevos of any business owner opening a restaurant amidst so much competition unfortunately in this case it wo nt turn out to be such a bold impressive move i ca nt see these restaurants all surviving in the area at the same time and the best will find it s way to the top it wo nt be indian paradise after a couple of tries this place is just not that good they offer a somewhat larger appearing selection than some of the other indian buffets the first visit when they had a busy rush due to their grand opening this larger selection seemed like a good thing however on the second visit when it was slower the food was sitting out aging for too long compared to their customer count so it did not stay fresh the dishes are decidedly unimpressive and ethnically confusing imagine a dish that is basically a chinese lo mein noodle with a flavor profile similar to mexican spanish rice and there s also a chinese chicken dish with indian spices there was a decent curry but the masala tasted like salsa lrb perhaps the written recipe had a typo who knows  rrb the mango chutney and custard have mangoflavored pears and other mixed canned fruit bits the bread that came as i finished my lunch was hot and fresh and very full of fresh garlic bits but also had some weird anise seed baked into the dough imparting an odd licoricey flavor that i did nt enjoy sitting down to a stella artois water glass was just stupid and the multiple pieces of fly paper strips hanging from the ceiling one over a food prepbar area the other over a customer dining table just really ensured that i wo nt be back not even to fall for another off coupon i am not sure which dish it was that my body chemistry altered as it attempted to digest and it made me all burpy the entire afternoon  and the burps tasted like the nonmarshmallow oatey catfood bits of lucky charms
i had the shrimp scallops and calimari it was pretty bland we had the only japanese cook and he was the only one who could nt spin knives throw things in the air etc was dissapointed the waiter could nt speak english and charged me fir a vodka on ice that we did nt order trying to get them to take it off the bill was more frustrating and stressful than paying the for it next time i think i ll try an authentic japanese place if i have the urge for japanese cuisine
i had high hopes for this place lrb maybe because i had nt read the reviews yet rrb but disappointed does nt even come close the decor is cool enough but that s where the good points end my husband and i went for lunch the other day and wont be returning the server was ok meaning she just did the bare minimum of service needed for her to be classified as a server the sad part was there were only a handful of people in there my husband ordered the sliders and i had the cadilac chicken burger with  tots and onion rings boy were they some sad looking meals there were small sliders and a small handful of fries and i had what i would classify as a fast food chicken burger but with no condiments lrb i had to ask for them afterwards rrb as for the  i only got onion rings and a small amount of tots the tots were good but the onion rings very greasy and soggy and the onions were not fresh they were like the onions on my burger they were old and dry and i had to peel the dry skins off before i ate them what i loved the most was at the bottom of the bill was a calculation for what a   and  tip would be lrb for our convenience rrb i wanted to write what a  tip would be i love how they just assume they deserve a  tip i am not against tipping lrb i have been known to leave some very nice tips rrb but i am against it being expected what a waste of i would not return even for a coupon added nice to see cr was speedy with their reply not no thank you i will not be returing and have mentioned this review to any who inquire
i used to love this place when it first opened lrb when it was half the size it was now and they had byob because they did nt have an alcohol license rrb we really enjoyed it the servers were friendly and fast and the manager walked around and checked on all her guests what the heck happened  this was my goto spot during weekdays around lunch when me and the girls would go in for their lunch special lrb a salad and pasta or pizza for rrb slowly this place was going from one of my favorite places to somewhere i would avoid there is no reason to have rude ignorant waiters who know nothing about the new items they ve added to their menu or how to use a register despite this because it s so close me and a couple friends went in to get the lunch special we were seated immediately in a cool area under an air vent lrb thank god rrb and our drink orders were taken as a server lrb a young blonde girl rrb introduced herself it took six minutes for our drinks to get to the table while we watched her chatting with a guy at the bar when we took our orders i got my usual i love their spring salad i always get it every time i come in because it s always delicious  and the pasta martini which my whole family enjoys when we come in our food came out quick and our bill came out shortly howver when we had asked for a split bill she must have forgotten we had all gotten the same thing lrb the lunch special and a soda rrb so we gave her our debit cards so she could split them up at the register she brought back our bills to sign and return our cards when i noticed my bill said  umm no  i immediately corrected her and she told me she would remove that from my card and replace it with my bill i left a small tip and left the next day i went on to check my bank account not only had i been charged the for someone else s order but the additional from mine thirty dollars  i called the manager and she asked for my reciept when i explained i did not have it lrb she had nt brought me one rrb she told me she could not help me even though i offered to print out my bank statement i doubt i will ever come back to this location i much prefer the location in uptown where the servers are friendly and out of high school
this had to be the worst chesesteak i have ever had or seen the meat is such a low grade that i would nt have trusted giving it to my pets the steak was so tough tasted so bad and smelled unlike any meat i have smelled before located in sky harbor in terminal i highly warn you to avoid this place and go to one of the many better choices located in the airport the counter you order from was dirty messy and unappetizing similar to how the cooking area behind it terrible no stars
no do nt do it this is my second review on this particular merchant they were previously located at w chandler blvd ste b inside of the bellagio clinic they promised that the move to their own facility would enable them to provide better service not at all apparently if you are a male and have an accent certain staff does not wish to be pleasant or provide even the most basic customer service let alone treatment let s just say my husband has had a truly horrible experience with this place to the point of being prejudicial but that is his story to tell i ve really tried to give this place a second chance after the last experience i had they swore up and down that that was not how they normally operate and that the move lrb another miles out of my way now totally from my home rrb would only allow them to improve service as they would no longer be restriced by working in a physician s office here is what i know it s impossible to get scheduled within a reasonable amount of time they are either under staffed overbooked or both it s impossible to speak to someone who is not a child seriously they all are just out of high school they ca nt answer simple questions and they are all sitting around texting or looking at facebook on their cell phones there is never any management on site how is this even permitted by their corporate office  the website says our staff includes a certified esthetician a registered nurse a nurse practitioner and a full time board certified medical doctor not true no one is in the office except for the very young and unsupervised laser technicians you can not call them directly you must call the number to ask questions about anything even to ask driving directions when you can not locate the new office and there is no signage to help you find the place they have tip jars in the rooms really  tip jars  is this starbucks  this to me is completely tacky i have been in the servicehospitablyspa industry for over ten years and i have never seen nor would even ever allow a tip jar to be placed in a treatment room with a huge sign stating that tips are appreciated of course they are  but do nt make me uncomfortable and feel obligated to leave one  especially when the service is so very poor to submit a complaint you must fill out a form online and wait for a call i did just that and received a call the next day from what i assume to be the location manager she left a voice mail i ve been trying to call her back for three days it goes straight to voice mail i ve left a voice mail but still no return call over it and getting all of my money back from groupon
let me first mention i do not have a problem with the organization petco i have been to several of the other petco stores located in the phoenix area and they have been just fine however laveen store is another story here is my experience i placed a phone call to petco to get my dog groomed i was told there was availability today lrb sunday rrb as the employee continued to ask me questions and i was placed on hold several times lrb several minutes each rrb once i answered the last question the employee then states that he can fit me in on wednesday of course this comes as a surprise since i asked if there was availability today and he had said yes therefore why would i wait until wednesday  so the next thing out of my mouth is i really like to get him in today and you said you had availability he asks me to hold on again and comes back with no explanation i said this is ridiculous you either have availability or you do nt i call back and speak to the customer service person i tell her the she offers to get my puppy in today and i said no i do nt think so not after the scenario that took place i do nt trust them with my puppy she says lrb and let me quote this rrb they are professional ha well i guess i am an idiot since the way i was treated was rude and i wo nt take a chance with my puppy here is my favorite line from the customer service person then why are you calling  story and tell her why they lost my business i explain she needs to know about how her employees are acting and maybe can do something about the situation she states well he is new i said ok but that does nt explain why they did that well let s see it is probably a good idea that you know what is going on in your store and get it fixed otherwise you will continue to lose good customers like myself she said well you said i ca nt do anything for you i said that s probably why you will be out of business and out of a job there is only one pet store in laveen and i prefer to drive up to dysart or th ave versus going back to your store do nt you think you need to tell the district manager or store manager so you can get it fixed if you do nt know about how your customers are being treated you ca nt fix it obviously this customer service person needs to go through training too she must be new lol rrb
stay away from this pharmacy i have never had any problems with any other pharmacy ever and the three times in the past months i ve been here have been a complete nightmare no one here cares about the customer and seem to have no idea what is going on i went to pick up an rx for me and one for my dog today and the girl at the register looked like she wanted to kill herself no smile and i could barely hear her speak she got me my prescriptions i paid and then i was on my way i thought it was odd that she did nt ask me if i wanted to see the pharmacist because my dog s rx was new and i know nothing about it i looked at the packaging and it said on it in bold letters that a consultation was needed i looked at my rx bag and it had all this stuff in bold that i was notified of the different packaging but that it s still the same pills i thought all this was odd because this girl told me nothing other than the total for my stuff turns out my pills were generic when it states specifically on my script that i can only have the name brand lrb due to complications with the generic in the past rrb i immediately go back inside and speak to one of the pharmacy techs and he blamed the mix up on the computer system bull and then he proceeds to tell me that they are out of stock on the name brand and they were out of stock on it last time i had to fill it i have never had such cruddy customers service and never have been to any other pharmacy were they are out of a well knownmuch used prescription twice last time they said it would be in tomorrow but it took over a week we will see if tomorrow means next week again
terrible service i went in there to look for a pair of cycling shoes yes they have decent prices which is why i went there in the first place however their customer service is nonexistent when i went in workers were standing around talking and laughing with each other they made no attempts to see if i needed help nor did they even say hello or bye i made a purchase and they asked me for my name phone number address etc i decline to give them my information and the guy at the register gave me an annoyed look no smile no hello no thank you for shopping with us i m not one who walks into a store and looks for those greetings specifically but how can you not notice when it s nonexistent so thinking maybe it was a fluke i went back a second time to look at other things in the store this time six guys lrb yes six rrb guys were standing around laughing and joking again no greeting by anyone and again no one offered to help me look for things i m shocked to see a bike shop as large as this offers no customer service at all i m going to return the stuff that i bought and take my business elsewhere this the worst customer service i ve had in a long time
since we had such a great experience with the kitchen we signed up with them for a few glass work lrb shower windows bla rrb trouble started when they were pushing us towards a design that they wanted to sell rather than what we wanted they were slowly nudging us towards that goal i did price it from several other vendors and the estimate was close so we decided to go with da vinci  however several restimations and remeasurements later they called us and told us that the original quote can not be honored anymore as they did not consider the materials we specifically asked for  they think they will have to demolish a portion of the stucco and rebuiild it in order for the window to fit the new quote came about  more than the original but the whole experience left us with a bad feeling and we canceled the remodel work
it really hurts my heart to give this dog park one star when the weather is cool i spend a lot of time here but both of my dogs got bordetella last time i was there my dogs are my children and anything thy gets them sick deserves one star it s unfortunate because it s not really the park it s more the people that go to this park time and time again i see puppies way to young to be at a dog park i have also seen dogs that do not look healthy or properly cared for here so i m over it i will drive a little bit to go to a nicer dog park that has people that take care of their pets
what a shit heap the sound is awful the food is awful and anything edible or potable is grossly overpriced even by venue standards despite the fact they have two huge projection screens you ll be lucky if they have one of them working much less both and the tickets dear lord the tickets if you ve going to pack us like sardines into a  degree venue without even the courtesy of breathing room lay off the ridiculous prices and magical fees there are about a million possible venues in arizona at which i d rather see a show than cricket and that includes a damp cardboard box on the corner of van buren
i dont think they care that they are so rude the worst service i have ever had i was amazed that they would treat their customers like that i will not spend any money there
they keep getting negative reviews filtered you can pay yelpers to write these reviews just look at craigslist they hire them all the time for bucks a review this place is discussing nobody goes there the owners are greedy and the waitress lrb they have like rrb is outright ignorant i m done checking on these reviews they have obviously paid people to say nice things about the place because nobody i know has anything good to say and have all boycotted the place for one reason or the other you are not getting accurate reviews here why would i come back and check here  my experience was that uphauling sure go there have fun when you get a hair in your burger and the waitress yells at you about it great place
food was great service not so great had to eat in the bar as they did not have any tables available due to reservations supposedly however the tables still were nowhere near full when we left waitress was lost half of the time and so i just gave another one my card to pay the tab looked at the receipt later when i got home and realized the prices in the menu were different than the prices on the receipt this is basically my fault for not checking but at the same time if the waitress was not so busy i would not felt like it was going to take forever to get the bill and get out of here and just gave them my card i ate here once before and it was great but on saturday it was less then great i am mixed about whether i will return the service is much better at houston s and i have never had to wait for a table or eat at the bar no matter how busy they are i should mention that the food was excellent though the bill came to  with tip for dinner for two might recommend others to try it but make sure you check your bill unlike me its about principle not the cost of the item
i hate giving bad reviews but i have been three times now and hated it every time the pizza has been soggy and the toppings fall off the crust crust is not good ordered salad w  pine nuts on it and we got a whole two lrb rrb yes we counted carefully great beer selection but otherwise meh other reviews seem okay so go and check it out you might love it just putting in my vote
let me start with the fact that i love old navy over the years i ve been able to find some great deals my problem with this old navy is customer service i had an employee complain to be about organizing racks when i talked to the manager i was offered and i quote appeasement bucks basically there strategy is to give me to shut up not a good customer service plan old navy
lisa you were very confrontational on the phone and assuring us that you were not responsible for any injuries again he tried to tell her to stop scrubbing the side of his toe so hard and with her being hearing impaired lrb we were told that she was deaf not just hearing impaired rrb she was unable to hear the damage had already been done we were running late getting my daughter to the airport that day and he did nt let me know it was so bad until we got home i am not the type of person who just sues every business that i come into contact with as a matter of fact i have never had a lawsuit against anyone in my life we continued to watch the toe until it got so bad we had to go to the dr i did nt rush right out and start trying to get anyone you or your insurance company to pay our bill it was nt until talking to you on the phone that i got upset the way that you talked to me and i believe you were very well paid for your services that day the way that you come across to your injured customers is inexcusible though as for the day that this occured he did tell the woman working on my feet that it was hurting and she told him that he was just sensitive i would warn anyone who is diabetic to go elsewhere an injury of that magnitude could cause some serious health issues my fiance and i are not out to make a quick buck on anyone i can assure you of that as for sterilizing your instruments apparently i am not the only one that have noticed the unclean practices that your salon is guilty of look at the other comments below an understanding business owner would have been nice you were on the verge of screaming at me on the phone i live in fountain hills and ca nt rush right back especially after the way that you talked to me on the phone i can appreciate you contacting your insurance agent but as of now we refuse to deal with you and will only work with your agent beware of this salon
i am not impressed with this place my original review makes this clear however the fact that they were closed on the sunday of memorial day weekend makes them useless in my book i was bringing two friends who had never been there and still have nt because they were closed businesses up and down central ave were busy especially hula s they could have gotten the overflow from hula s but they were closed at on a sunday night
had a horrible experience there tonight to put this in perspective i rarely say that about any restaurant we had a groupon and went based on good reviews on this site four of us went to dinner there  three of us ordered glasses of red wine wine was warm in all three glasses and had rather skimpy pours the bottle we ordered later was good temperature though  ordered bruschetta and the cheese plate they made a mistake on the order no big deal and sent back the order however seconds later someone other than our server lrb the manager  rrb brought us the very same plate we just sent back sent that back seconds later the waiter shows up and proceeds to tell us what we ordered  which he had wrong once we got the right order they were good lrb although  the bruschetta bread was not toasted all that well rrb  egg plant lasagna short ribs and margherita flat bread were good  i ordered the prosciutto copa and brie sandwich which was listed under the wood fired sandwiches i got a cold sandwich with mediocre bread yes i should have sent it back and would have if either the manager or our waiter would have showed up at some point after bringing us our orders by the way the place was mostly empty at this point  as noted above we had a groupon with a value of approx which included drinks appetizers entrees and dessert we had those and ordered a bottle of wine on top of that bringing the bill to approx wout subtracting the value of the groupon waiter brings the bill which should have been approx lrb after subtracting the groupon value rrb we explained several times to him that it should be approx not our guests were going to cover the difference plus the tip on their credit card what charge comes back  you guessed it even after correcting the mistake it was approx lrb assume the diff was taxes rrb  free valet is really not necessary given the parking is all of about feet from the door however the valet attendant was very nice and had our cars ready even before we got out there  even after all the screw ups our server boasting about how great everything is and fishing for a big tip we got no apologies for any of the mistakes they made needless to say i will never go to this place again this experience could be an anomaly but i d be surprised if they re still in business months from now
i went to this place because it looks run down on the outside and i interpreted that s a wrap in a cynical way i thought i could sit and bask in my cynical drudgery but instead they tried to offer me  price food like really  i m a believer in adding percent to regular prices just to flip the table on societal norms perhaps even incorporate a wildcard bitches after you ring up the sheeple moving on they had a selection of beer and wine in some glass case behind the register like why is it in a glass case  do you think we are going to swipe this mainstream corporate beer  no maybe if you guys had pabst but something tells me by the repulsive atmosphere of this place that such delicacies would be out of your range the minion at the register spoke english how am i supposed to practice my broken spanglish when this slave to society speaks english i just do nt get people and their old broken ways of life look at me though being a slave to quotations and periods i do nt need periods or quotations or commas or any of that brainwashing crap schools try to instill in us from now on you can just deal with it deal with me and hopefully not deal with that s a wrap a better name would be that s all mainstream crap haha i crack myself up sometimes when you are at this level of intellect you forget to look around and pat yourself on the back several times a day i have a timer of when to pat myself on the back because i believe i deserve praise for my cultural and intellectual superiority to the vagrant municipalities of structured living why does that s a wrap even have tortillas thats so vintage finally what i have to tell you is that if you are a sellout poser you can fit right in to that s a wrap for me though im on to better things in life i was thinking of replacing my monitor with a mirror because it would probably be more interesting to look into my complexity than any thing i could find on the internet
do not go here for fingerprint services i went to this location to have my fingerprints done for a fingerprint clearance card for school this store advertised this service for so i chose this store to have my fingerprints done when i arrived at the store and told the clerk what i needed she handed me a small square ink pad and told me to roll my fingers on the ink pad and then on the paper she then charged me and i was on my way i know nothing about fingerprinting i assumed they did weeks later my card was returned to me because of the poor job i did well big surprise i lost critical time for this time sensitve document who advertises this service but does not actually provide the correct service  i went to the police department to have this done and it came out much darker and clearer and was obviously done properly by a trained professional please stop offering this service since you are not trained on how to do fingerprints i called the store to let them know of the situation and the clerk seemed way too busy to really listen to me did nt seem like he cared much and told me to bring my receipt in and have it redone oh yeah that s what i want to do lose another weeks of time on my time sensitive document not a happy camper over here with this store
so my husband and i have been in arizona a little over a year and i ve heard such great reviews for this place so for my husbands birthday i thought lets give it a shot well the atmosphere was good but that s it the rolls and fry bread hard the salad socked with dressing and not crisp and the chicken blah and lastly the steak would be better if i cooked it at home nice view and atmosphere wish the food tasted better
what s going on with the food here  is there new owners  the food seems to be getting less tasty each time i come here the beef for the green burrito is not the same the cheese lrb white rrb is horriible taste like cafeteria or hospital food i hope the owner did nt sell and now some cheap owner are buying food now i used to give this place a star and now i would have to grade them as a star until they improve the quality of there food
date  in the past year i have eaten in your peoria store not less than times we use this place to meet with our friends and children we can come in get something to eat and chat tonight my wife and i went there to eat she ordered a bowl of tomato basil soup and i ordered the same in a bread bowl the bread bowls just have a small divot in the top for the soup this divot is much to small for a cup of soup and it spills into the plate i asked if enough bread could be removes to hold the soup without it spilling onto the plate nothing was said when my order was delivered to the table the person proceeded to tell me that if i wanted it that way in the future they would have to charge me for a bowl of soup instead of a cup i never asked for any special consideration on the price when i ordered the soup would not that of not been the time to tell me that it would cost more to fix the soup the way i wanted  the person that delivered the soup then proceeded to lecture me on the fact that i had gotten more than i had paid for i asked her to please leave i had to do this twice as she continued to try and lecture i did not get her name she was about slim light brown hair probably or less i should of called for the manager but at that time i was so mad i just ate my soup and left i have been eating out for many years this is the worst service i have ever had maybe you think one out of times in the restaurant is acceptable for bad service i do nt i did write a letter to the corporate office lets see if they care 
went here on a groupon and had a terrible experience after waiting min for a table to open up waited another for menus flagged down the waitress asked for water waited another for water she shoved water glasses on our table left waved her down said she d be right over she seated menued and watered a group of four that had just arrived with the already horrendous service we figured service would be faster if we ordered items we could cook on the table top when we the food arrived we received only two sets of dishes and silverware for people the remainder of our meal our server never stopped by after trying to wave her down for one thing after another i resorted to going behind the counter myself even taking their water pitcher to refill our waters
so this first experience started off with a huge cockroach in the bathroom almost could nt even sit down to go lrb yuck rrb ok on to the rest the chips and salsa were good with a little bit of spice the numero is a cheese enchilada with a chicken taco rice and beans the only flavor at this restaurant was in the salsa it was so bland i do nt know that it was worth the parking validation we came for my friend and i love mexican so we picked it on our way elsewhere my suggestion go elsewhere
the service was lousy i have had better service before at the one at arrowhead mall my daughter spilled her drink and they gave her an apron to clean herself  they left the soda on the floor so we had to step on it the whole time what 
do nt waste your time at this store
i wish they had a star option  the hostess was visibly sick  as we were getting our food our son dropped some raw chicken onto the counter top as we already passed through my husband stopped me and said the girl behind the counter with gloved hands scooped up the raw chicken  threw it out  and then proceeded to refill the vegetables and touched all the handles with the same gloves this is clearly a health issue and i will be reporting this establishment to the department of public health you do nt even need a food service trainingcard to know that you do nt touch raw meat and then touch other stuff without changing gloves andor washing your hands you just have to be outright dumb food poisoning at it s finest these place needs some better management and training for their employees we will not dine here ever again
i used petsmart for the grooming services i took my dog in there to get his claws cut the lady from rude from the beginning she asked if for more if i wanted to get his claws sanded down also for smoothness i said yes and then left my little guy in there to get groomed all she did was barely sand the tips down did nt cut anything off so i paid for my dog to basically have nothing done
the most overrated yelprecommended place i ve yet to encounter i am a fan of dives i like to find places that are a little rough around the edges that serve food to please a local community those places are why i use yelp in the first place ow is a dive but as such i judged accordingly my star rating has nothing to do with it s atmosphere or clientele i will admit that the rating has to do with things some of which others may not have experienced on their visits sometimes patrons try a place out and its just a bad day  the kitchen is off the waiters are slammed the manager just got divorced unfortunately for those restaurants them s the breaks you do nt often get second chances to make a first impression  and my first impression of the original wineburger s blew onto the three things first the burger for a venue named after it s signature product you d think more attention would be paid to quality the burger was served on a very nice bun but the meat that was on it was by all accounts flavorless i expected a wine taste or some sweetness or some aroma i and my companion both had to add salt to what was otherwise a patty devoid of taste second the fries yes they are beer battered but i d be hard pressed to give a place laurels for something that rally s can replicate and to make matters worse they came to me burned severely burned  like an albino left in the desert without suntan lotion inedible we sent them back  but really how do you screw up fries  it s not even cooking  you re just waiting for the oil to do its work all you have to look at a timer  when a place screws up fries lrb or toast for that matter rrb there s anarchy in the kitchen finally the service now here s where it gets tricky since ow is a dive i m not expecting great service that s not what they are there to do  the service should be very basic  right  take my order bring me my food in a reasonable time and bring me my bill with a smile that s all if it s really busy i m even more lenient on the night we went ow was practically empty  there were two other tables in the place it took our waitress minutes to greet us which does nt sound long  but is far longer than most places on a slow night when we placed our order we asked about the wineburger what s it about  since we never had one before we thought it a reasonable question to ask based on her response you would have thought we asked her if we could take a crap on her floor our food took a little long to get out to us but we thought it was due to the painstaking magic that was going on behind the scenes when we sent our fries back for fresh ones we got them long after the burgers were finished rendering them useless the final insult was when trying to leave we could nt find our waitress  apparently she took her cigarette break just as we were ready to leave  so we had to flag down another waiter to leave the place again this experience may be atypical but its real now i ask you fellow yelpers when a place gives you bad food and bad service  what rating are you supposed to give them  i certainly would not recommend this place to any person i like
dude do nt eat at filiberto s i do not understand why they are so popular all over the valley maybe it s good for drunks whose stomachs are so polluted with skunky beer and whose palate has been ruined by smoking cheapass ditchweed but the food at filiberto s looks like someone already ate it and they put it on a paper plate i tried it twice to be fair and i feel lucky to be alive
not a fan i truly believe people are tricked by the decor it really does make you feel cute and happy but it s like a wolf in sheeps clothing bc the food and service suck this applies to every fox concept i ve decided our waiter was a diva and not in a good way he rolled his eyes at me several times and all i did was ask for lemon with my water then i asked for vinegar and oil on the side instead of on my salad it came on my salad so i asked politley if i could have a new side salad he got so pissed and grabbed my plate without saying anything when he returned he just slammed it down in my face i would have walked out if i was nt with people i hate rude servers then i ordered the kobe burger and it was burnt on the outside and it had no flavor i had to salt and pepper the crap out of it last time i pay for a gross burger and rude service i do nt care how effing cute your patio is
i ca nt even afford the milk here
what  am i in east oakland  ghetto horrible customer service i walked up to the deli counter and the worker behind the counter walked away wth what s  service with a smile  no  have a nice day  so i sarcastically said thank you as i was walking out and i get a  you re welcome i was thanking you for doing nothing bagger wth oh i guess i should feel safe since there s police that frequently hang out in front of fry s  wth i would nevereverever go to the wells fargo here because it attracts crazies and there are panhandlers in the parking lot my experience with the wells fargo is for another review
the worst bra shopping experience of my life after spilling out of a ddi figured it was time to get remeasured i was measured so poorly the girl suggested a b or c  uhm needless to say if you spill out of a dd a b or c is going to be comical the fit was so off and the girl seemed okay with it job well done in her mind my husband was laughing seeing me lrb which almost made the experience fun rrb i had a lot more luck at belle lacet in chandler  there you are actually fitted and the service is excellent
pretty disappointing had nail polish all over fingers and toes did nt cut nails or cuticles supposed to get massage with what i paid for but it was bad nails were smudged but she did nt fix them and she did nt know how to do gel i almost cried because i had wasted hours of my life when i could have done them better at home please do nt waste your time i wish someone had warned me
we received horrible service at the bar food was good
i went there for my birthday to get gel french nails done the workmanship was good but within a day they cracked and started peeling when i got home i was told that they did not do a proper job
worst brunch on  i have ever had ordered eggs benedict with salmon for dollars and received eggs totally uncooked with canadian bacon bought to their attention and minutes later received eggs benedict with cold salmon on an non toasted cold muffin ugh
ordered the pasta bread bowls got one with chicken the other mac and cheese chicken was raw and mushy on one and the other had no sauce and the pasta was hard like a rock
they lie we terminated membership when we moved out of the area and asked for the final month of dues refunded since we would not be able to use the club management squirmed and said it was corporate policy out of their hands but they would ask of course the answer was no corporate hides behind local management and is very difficult to contact directly but i found a way and discussed the matter extensively and reasoned that they should not be paid for doing nothing corporate stated they would have local management call me to discuss further never happened manager jim m is a smileyfaced fulleyecontact liar in the end we were shafted for for this overpriced overcrowded underventilated sweat house
no more coolatta the coolatta machine is broken at all locations apparently why the lrb  bleep  rrb are you still selling coolatta if the machine s broken  does corporate office know they re scamming customers  horrible customer service
beware this place is a scam and they sell garbage i bought a tire at the end of july and the tire fell apart in september the car sat most of the summer i called mike and he proceeded to tell me that it was my fault his tire was crap he had the audacity to tell me that the tire was ran to low of pressure when my car has a built in gauge that measures tire pressure and then proceeded to tell me that my car computer was wrong this guy had a bs excuse for everything and he was extremely rude their customer service was horrible beware avoid this place i tried to save a couple bucks but in the long run i will be paying more
meh food was okay service was very slow and my friend found a piece of bone in her food wanted to like it but thumbs down unfortunately
i typically like the berto places but they certainly range from location to location this one is not a good one try filberto s a mile down the road on th street and indian lrb newly remodeled and clean they also give you chips while you wait rrb or armando s on th and thomas these rec s of course are limited only to berto s type of places if your not in a hurry the list changes entirely
not at all impressed in my mind when you re holding yourself out to be new york pizza in the valley you d better stack up in three categories crust sauce and cheese this pizza did nt live up to my expectations in any category let s start with the crust when i remember new york pizza crust i think of a crust whose outside is crisp but whose inside is still moist and doughy allowing for a convenient fold ray s crust reminded me more of cardboard the crust snapped in half when i tried to fold the slice moreover the crust did nt have any of the sweetness that i remember it had no flavor whatsoever having saved the outer crust for last thinking maybe that it would save my meal i took one bite and stopped the sauce continues the flavorless theme there was no sweetness no acidity to the sauce i think they could have omitted whatever sauce they used altogether and the end product would not have been any worse and the cheese despite the fact that my slice was put in the oven and came out piping hot the cheese had nt seemed to melt at all and did nt move at all from first bite to last in addition to not melting the cheese lrb or should i say cheese  rrb was wait for it completely flavorless it did nt appear or taste fresh and completely failed to live up to the quality of even the shady slices you can run across near grand central station i would not compare this to peter piper pizza much less new york pizza not recommended
the service was horrible our food was wrong when it came out and they acted as if we did wrong for calling them out on it the music was too loud i definitely will not be going back
i came to testdrive a car and all of the questions i asked the salesman read the answers directly off the sticker since i am a literate person that was nt necessary nor was it relevant as the questions i had about the vehicle did nt have answers that could have been found on the sticker yeah i do my own research before i waltz into these places and when i ask questions i expect my expert sales guy to answer them as he is supposed to know what he s selling right  i had to leave the next day salesguy einstein called me and then a few days later and again a few days after that i ll give him that for at least being persistent but he thought the price was the problem  not the car itself which i decided i did nt like anymore after i drove it and he was leaving me these ridiculous messages about selling me a used mercedes it was all really annoying and embarrassing to listen to
this will never be a shopping destination for me unless i need to visit the apple store i m staying away for the most part the center is a collection of over priced restaurants and clubs if you need your ego lrb or other parts rrb stroked by barely year old female wannabee s take a viagra and your wallet with you the parking availability is terrible plus the valet reserved zones have made it shopper unfriendly
we have submitted a claim to anthem for lost boxes of household items and one broken plasma tv all totaling over we completed all claim forms and sent detailed reports of items and cost as well as photos of the broken tv on the day of delivery the movers called ahead to be reassured the check was ready before they would unload they did not mark any inventory list of what they unloaded but my husband did they did not wait for items to be unpacked and inspected but insisted we sign the forms so they could leave we noted in the space for remarks that we were continuing to inspect inventory and condition anthem has refused to pay anything on our claim on the basis that we packed our own bill of lading was signed indicating shipment was received in good condition and not noting loss or damage occurring during transit this case will go to litigation i recommend you beware of any moving company who is using anthem we first booked with budget who sub contracted us to northwest relocation in portland or and they moved out things from eugene put in storage moved them to phoenix put them in storage and finally delivered them to green valley az we are not happy with this service
fyi will not accept restarauntcom coupons printed off the coupon and headed out for the min drive to check this place out and there was a big sign on the door that said we do not accept restaruntcom coupons then why are you offering a coupon on there  we all kinda had a bad taste for this place after we saw the sign and went to switch instead
too expensive dollar beers access to vip section then for a minute lap dance with her only sitting on me times over years ago i went to a strip club near the airport lrb ca nt remember the name of the club rrb and i got a close contact lap dance for minutes for a total of with tip the woman had a c section scar but still looked good can someone please tell me which strip club has better prices 
needs a new name  now the pischke s of old had such a sad ending i appreciated mcgrath s effort to keep pischke s alive but it is nothing nothing nothing like the pischke s of old call it the blue ribbon cafe  take out the pischke name  i ca nt imagine that chris pischke would have been honored to be remembered this way if his restaurant was a reflection of who he was as a person  pischke s blue ribbon cafe would be the exact opposite of who he was the current restaurant is not a laid back family friendly and yet a bar all at once restaurant that serves an unending array of crazy good sandwichessaladsetc  the current decor is pretentious and the food matches that
the bn in peoria has to be the most lackluster bn in phoenix just looking at the exterior compared to other bn is very dated as a reviewer mentioned you walk inside and the ambiance just is nt there this store needs major updating i am shocked that bn has this store in aarowhead please build a better larger store in aarowhead or westgate as we deserve something better than this
boo i have to admit that being a former waitress i have never not left a tip  even when the service has been borderline atrocious i did nt really have a problem this time so the restaurant itself is nice enough a man who spoke little english took our drink orders and we thought he was our waiter so we asked him to make sure he split the checks he gave us an annoyed look and brushed off the request demanding that we hurry and order beverages minutes later a woman came out and once again rushed us into ordering we told her again that we needed the checks split and she waved us off the food was okay  nothing that screams out for a james beard or anything my tortilla soup was watery and packed with corn kernels and some cheese then topped with deep fried won ton strips lrb not tortilla strips rrb my burger came out cold and dry lrb not dry texture but literally dry with no sauce rrb i asked for some remoulade or mayo and ten minutes later they came back with italian dressing in a cup and said we do nt have any of that other stuff funny it was in the menu so i choked down my burger and waited for my check and waited and waited when it arrived it came split in two we had asked for separate checks but four of us ended on one tab and two ended on the other the waitress then accused us of not telling her that we wanted our checks split then why did she split the freaking check in two  no idea what happened there minutes later she returned with the split checks and we gave her the credit cards another minutes later we sent one of our party to hunt her down the manager came out at one point and just smiled at us like she had no idea what we were talking about we ended up burning almost hours at this establishment minutes after that she finally returned with our checks i do nt think i ll be back
this place is great if you hate things that get all assertive with your taste buds i really have no idea how they managed to make their food so bland maybe if they spent some money on a recipe book instead of a graphic design campaign they d do a little better the fact that it won something from the new times proves how corrupt that process is
i have always been a huge fan and have sent lots of people there but that has all changed the staff is incredibly rude the manager cameron has no customer service skills and yelled at customers there used to be a friendly staff this place is getting to have a bad reputation when i was there i heard severs cussing and complaining about their tables right infront of everyone i will never go back to the scottsdale location inless the staff gets better as of now chandler still has my business
this place normally would get stars but as of today it gets star in our book such a disappointment my daughter and i went in for our favorite flavors which they always had as angel sweet birthday cake was nt there their bubble gum was nt the typical blue but pink they said they did nt bring it i did nt know what that meant but found it odd since i thought everything was made on the premises then i tasted different flavors noticing an odd smelltaste total lack of creaminess and consistency even the appearance looked more like ice cream angel sweet was known for creamy smooth consistency with flavors that were pure and lingered i honestly tasted some different smelltaste that did nt linger on the tongue that almost had an ice type consistency i commented on it to the new woman behind the counter i said that something was totally different she then told me that angel sweet was combining with gelato spot i asked if they used the same recipes and methods she stalled and looked to the young girl who i recognized as an angel sweet employee she then answered pretty much the same well i can tell you it is completely different and not in a good way i could nt find a flavor good enough to eat my daughter bought one because she felt bad if we did nt she said on the way home she did nt like it it tasted weird and gave it to her dad so sad angel sweet will be hugely missed
why are most of the great places so far from home if customer service was food these guys would be limburger cheese three times i have been here and three times i received neither a hello nor a may i help you  last time there i spent about minutes there looking at various things and could nt believe they were too busy to acknowledge me there is always a stocky bearded man behind the counter i think he has a grizzly adams complex i asked him three questions in a row and his answers were no more than two words each no i do nt know and no when i asked if they had grit sandpaper he looked at me like i was from outer space i did purchase two pieces of sandpaper there once i thought i had cash but did not so i had to pay about on my debit card the guy looked at me like i just ruined his day i was not expecting nor did i receive a thank you or have a nice day it was almost a snobby atmosphere like i was in an exclusive club i did nt belong since they had no answers to any questions i asked for a suggestion he said to try another store that advice i gladly took and have found a couple great places to go bye bye grizzly
too bad this place is now closed lrb they had really good chai and frozen coffee drinks they will be missed
this place is aweful i got my brakes done and just months later they were toast called to have them fix and they refuse they took my and now wo nt honor fixing their crappy job my advice  avoid this place at all costs
purchased two pairs of glasses for my son and picked them up today i would never pay their prices if they were nt on sale they are  times as expensive as other places by biggest issue is their terrible lack of service when i picked out the glasses and paid it took over minutes to be helped i asked if they were just busy today and their employee said no it is actually a little slow i could nt believe it since there several of us waiting to be helped tonight was no different it took minutes of standing in line to simply pick up the glasses like last time there were only two employees working i wo nt be coming back
i usually love mimi s but lately they ve been messing up quite a bit we place a to go order with them at least onceweek and dine in a couple of timesmonth last night we got the usual turkey dinner and strawberry walnut salad with chicken we asked that our bread basket consist of banana bread only as we usually do nick took our order  he usually does the salad had no chicken but we got charged for it dinner size the bread basket had slices of banana bread and the rest were dinner roll lrb not even after all we ordered entrees rrb and carrot rasin slices had we not specified the muffin flavor we would not have got a muffin at all although it comes with the salad every time i order the salad and i do nt tell them what muffin to give me they just do nt give me any and if i do nt ask for the bread basket i do nt get that either although it is complimentary i am sorry i wish i could give them a star review because their food is delicious but they definitely do not know how to treat their repeat customers  the neglijence is unacceptable especially that we get charged for things we do not get we will most likely find another place to order from now on
my family has had an la fitness membership with family add on s for years now about a year ago my mother canceled her membership we called today to inquire about adding her back on we spoke directly with the gm who quoted us the regularly advertised prices  which makes sense however the gm s attitude was far from customer service oriented i asked about waiving the enrollment fee which has happend at every gym i ve ever joined lrb gold the village powerhouse and la fit rrb and he referenced they do not do that if they did it would turn into a used car lot after referencing golds he said apples to oranges and eventually hung up on me is nt that the point  when joining a gym you compare  great customer service goes really far with gym customers as a gm he should be a leading example not hanging up on veteran customers pretty scary its funny how different la fitness operate these days compared to years ago no wonder so many people are jumping ship and moving toward crossfit and studio style gyms as for adding my mother after being hung up on we decided to go with gold s cheaper and a much more upscale facility gold s has a smaller  women s only room with free weights and a few cardio machines overall a better experience for her
in a way i m not surprised because the people working there was snooty all too often and mj s business hours were erratic at best worse  i stopped by there a couple of times since their  open sign was lit but the place was closed
probably my worst dining experience ever went on saturday evening had a lovely time drinking overpriced cocktails outside while enjoying the gorgeous setting that is where any mention of a pleasurable experience ends once seated the service was dismal at best server took mins to bring one glass of champagne even though we saw it sitting in the bar ready to be picked up for over mins lrb the other members of my party were never even offered a refreshed cocktail the entirety of our stay rrb took another mins for us to track down a different waiter so he could go find our waiter so we could order appetizers came fairly quickly and were just ok very disproportionate servings and not at all worth the prices after our apps came another mins passed before we finally flagged down the manager to find out rrb where our waiter was and rrb where the rest of our meal was mins later the manager came back to tell us that the delay was due to our chicken people in my party ordered the chicken  did nt realize they had to kill the chicken and prep it before cooking because i have never had to wait over mins for chicken lrb mins while we ate our apps and another mins eating our nd basket of bread rrb our waiter finally showed up acting completely aloof wondering why we were upset and then quickly disappeared again another mins and still no food we had had enough we flagged down the manager to advise we d be leaving he tried to get us to stay and offered to pay for our meals at that point he could have offered us meals for the next month for free and we would not have bitten this was beyond horrible and honestly the one star i gave it was very generous there is nothing anyone could do to ever make me return to this establishment with the staff they have working there for what was supposed to be high end resort dining this was anything but i ve gotten much better service at chili s bar and grill and that is just pathetic the management and owners of prado should be ashamed
no no no half chinese food half burger joint with mexican food  cash only  greasy feeling just from walking in  tried this place because i kept hearing good things but it was a total let down there was an accidental piece of orange chicken in my bag of french fries burger was nt memorable but i remember not really thinking that the vegetables were vegetables quite gross
this used to be my favorite place in the valley to shop for work clothes even though the parking situation is kind of a pain they always have great deals lrb especially if you have one of their weekly coupons rrb however their customer service has gotten progressively worse over the past year or so and after the experience i had over the weekend i will be spending my money elsewhere from now on in addition to being disinterested and unhelpful they also start pushing you out the door minutes before closing so that they can all make it to their evening plans on time if you re not done shopping they wo nt hold your clothes over night so that you can come back to shop the next day lrb or allow you a few extra minutes to make your purchase right then rrb and it s like pulling teeth to get them to validate your parking my recommendation would be to drive to the locations in either chandler or tempe marketplace for the same great deals free parking and a super nice and friendly staff to assist you
the food at this location without exception has always been some of the best i ve been to a couple pita jungle s in and around phoenix and this was the best sadly they also have some of the worst service i have ever seen does nt seem to matter if the place is packed or not lunch or dinner crowd or just the inbetween you always seem to get slow service what s worse than that is the fact that there is no apology for it my wife and i were regulars and had been going to this place literally for a couple of years on an almost weekly basis more and more the service began putting us off and recently we had two or three bad experiences in a row and decided to just stop going there altogether the servers in question just left our table hanging despite working the table right next to us right in front of us and right behind us without missing a beat a lesser person who did nt always tip heavily would have thought it was deliberate were it not for the fact that it happened multiple times with one seasoned and one brand new server i did bring this to the attention of the owner and he informed me that he only works the day shift now which means he is never there in the evening when my wife and i used to frequent the place i suggested he spend some more time on the night shift and get his wait staff in line but i m not going to spend any more of my time or money to give them a fourth or fifth chance they have given me bad service for the last time
horrible people they shredded my brand new garment the manager was trailer trash rude but finally said that the owner would call me within two days four days later i tracked down the owner i barely got a word out when he started screaming at me that the garment was old then he called me a liar and a cheat and told me to get the f out of his store this was the worst experience i have ever had with any business
the gelato spot seems good until you try arlecchino gelateria if you re craving gelato do yourself the favor of cruising over to th street and campbell for the real deal but the gelato spot is open a bit later than arlecchino so i can see where you might have to settle for prefab gelato in a pinch the gelato spot has perfected its offering for its upscale neighborhood the imported cases are as gorgeous as those displaying jewels in a fine department store the wood and chrome cases proudly show off a huge array of flavors gussied up with trinkets that correspond to each flavor the variety is a problem because they offer too many flavors for each one to be handcrafted daily what proof do i have of this  i offer up exhibit a httpwwwgelatospotcomdownloadscalendarpdf there you will find a monthly calendar that lists out the flavors available every day of the month and the special flavors that run for about two weeks at a time dear discerning foodie reader if the gelato spot was seeking out the freshest local ingredients and handcrafting their gelato each day how could they possibly know what they would produce for an entire month at a time  i also offer up exhibit b blood orange sorbetto in may the season for blood oranges ended months ago so they are offering a flavor out of season that s not a huge deal if you re willing to settle for variety over quality i ve also noticed they tend not to adjust the freezers in the winter so that the gelato becomes overly frozen of course that s not a concern in the dead of a phoenix summer it s nice that they adjoin a coffee shop next door in terms of amenities decor and branding the gelato spot has got it all if you re looking for a corporate experience and flash on one visit there was a soap dispenser in the rest room labeled please do nt steal me it was gone by my follow up visit apparently arcadia is not untouched by petty crime
this place is awful i wish i could give it no stars i had a terrible experience here and wrote my previous review earlier this week their pr person contacted me and asked more about it so i told them they asked if they could pass my information along to the director of operationsowner and i received a two page letter degrading me and basically telling me that i am a selfrighteous b  tch who knows nothing about customer service and i only care about myself todd goldman the owner who so kindly took the time to teach young girls like lrb me rrb life lessons about customer service and the restaurant industry and point out that i get so mad and take it so personally that lrb i rrb fail to think rationally while lrb i rrb struggle with the idea that lrb i am rrb not the most important person in the world apparently my myopic viewpoint and exaggerated opinion of lrb myself rrb are staggering whatever he may feel about me i do know one thing about him i will never step foot in one of his establishments ever again this does not seem to bother mr goldman because as he told me in his letter from this evening according to him lrb i rrb feel that lrb i rrb am so influential in this community that lrb my rrb posting will dissuade people from visiting lrb their rrb establishments i only wish i could attach the pdf letter that was sent to me that includes all of these lovely morsels of insight and opinion so you all could have the pleasure of reading it i can not imagine ever sending something of this magnitude to an upset customer and yes i do hope that people read this and see that they should pick fox sports grill half moon blue firehouse bar and grill duke s american junkie or any of the other sports bars in scottsdalephoenix to enjoy their bar food beer and sports viewing it is unbelievable behavior coming from a business owner and mr goldman should be ashamed of himself  addition   i was currently in the building with guests sitting at a person table when i asked to be accommodated i was not asking him to hold tables for us i was asking that they take care of actual customers 
requests not taken on dishes i m not a big fan of carrots and asked if the dish i was interested in ordering could be prepared without them no i then asked about several other dishes and the bottom line was that they prepared them how they wanted to and the customer be damned when my food finally arrived i asked for a refill on my drink  that refill never came the food was bland and i had to remove all the vegatables i did nt want every other thai restaurant i ve been to has no problem with a simple request like this and had much better service
the pizza and service sucks here the cheese has no flaver and the pizza sauce reminds me somthing that you get out of a can and the crust was tough and reminded me of store bought the staff were unhelpfull and rude the crzyiest thing was when were were going to take our left over pizza home the took our left overs and put them in a fricking paper bag yea a bag not a pizza box i could only laugh and ask them wow you trying to save money on not using pizza boxes  as we walked out the bag was sucking up the grease i just left it by there door i was so pist do nt go there frozen pizza is better
this review is for service only as i did not see any flower arrangements i was looking for a local florist to help with my wedding flowers instead of buying the flowers from an online wholesale site i preferred to buy from a local florist  however i wanted to do the centerpieces and bouquets myself i went to gloria s lrb and i believe i spoke with gloria herself rrb and she was very very rude to me she did not like that i wanted to do the arrangements myself  which is fine if she said no she would nt order flowers for me however she said she would order flowers for me but she just gave me attitude about it in the process she then proceeded to ask me what kind of flowers i wanted when i responded to say that i did nt know yet and was hoping a florist could help give me some guidance she seemed shocked you don t know  i told her my wedding colors and again requested guidance from an expert she again asked me why i did nt know what flowers i wanted and then started to begrudgingly show me some flowers by this point i was very fed up and let her know that i would not be needing her services so while i can not review any of her actual arrangements i can say that my experience with this florist was extremely rude and i would prefer to go somewhere else
first time i ate here they gave me chicken when i ordered beef i had taken it to go so nothing i could do just ate here again for lunch now i feel kinda high or drunk or something almost hallucinogenic and not in a good way though the toilet did just help me feel better
icon is the bar inside the wyndham hotel downtown since this newly renovated bar is walking distance from my home i was dying for this to be yet another cool place in downtown phx to hang out my first impression upon entering the hotel was that my dream had indeed come true the new lobby of the hotel is relative to the older version spectacular and impressive as you enter the lobby and first glance at the new bar with its chic decor and sleek furniture that impression continues but something just does nt work with this bar as you find a seat and make yourself comfortable i m no architect or interior designer by any means and do nt pretend i am but somehow the bar does nt fit with the lobby even though the wall decor the lounge chairs and sofa and the backdrop to the bar itself all look very modern and er sexy lrb you can see what i m talking about from the web link above rrb maybe it s the fact that there s too much open space if you re seated at this bar with a friend or date you feel like you re in the same space as people and employees wandering around the lobby who have nothing to do with the bar there s no sense of intimacy with either who you are with or with the rest of the bar there s too much light from the lobby of course plus when i came here with a friend we ordered drinks and some tapas which i ve come to learn over the years is the american translation for tiny portions of food at ripoff prices as opposed to what i expect in real tapas in europe in fairness the tapas here were very good and tasty but they are in fact very expensive and not at all worth it in my humble opinion it s not that i had a bad experience per se at icon i just feel a bit disappointed the wyndham is located directly across the street from another or story bar currently being constructed in downtown phoenix that s expected to be a true destination bar for people from all over the valley lrb built by the owner of scottsdale s az rrb a great bar at this location would have transformed this part of adams street in a major way instead of being great it s middle of the road though i ll drop in now and then edit after my second visit here in august i have to downgrade to one star one star for me means i will never come here again lrb and i live walking distance from it rrb  and i will never recommend anyone else come here either except maybe to just walk through the lobby to check out the new look i came here on a first friday when downtown phoenix is jampacked to the hilt with visitors and the vibe here was absolutely dead there was no one in the bar other than hotel guests wondering what the fuss was about everywhere other than in icon our waitress was extremely annoying we stopped here intending to check it out get one quick overpriced drink and move on she was so slow that this process somehow turned into an hour talk about a buzzkiller big mistake stopping here one i wo nt make again
 lowering cane s expectations should be the name they have just set the bar low on food quality and taste no seasoning at all in the breading of the chicken fingers and the fries seem like they came straight from your grocer s freezer must not have thought much of their dog if this is their tribute to him just drove away disappointed want my junk food to taste good if i m going to splurge with this type of caloric intake only positive was stellar drivethru service and the place seemed pretty clean do nt waste your time
you people are fing nuts this place could not be more americanized and could not taste more like cafeteria food it looks like most reviewers gave stars for how cheap the food is half off drinks wow that helps me figure out if this place serves good food or not is greek beer supposed to be warm and flat as well  service was terrible food came out very fast but it was cold which led me to believe it was sitting there prepared ahead of time ugh
if i could give china chili less than one star i would friends keep dragging me there because it is walking distance from their offices if they keep insisting on china chili i might have to show up too late to get lunch i have never had a good meal there the worst was mushu that tasted like the vegetables in it were canned
it is hard to isolate the single worst thing about hob nobs is it the shabby management  the filthy cook  or the hipster emo counter staff  amber who took our order clearly thinks customer service is beneath her we ordered cesar salads and a sandwich the salads were served fairly quickly by a cook who s uniform was clearly encrusted with a week s worth of food debris gross but where the hell is my sandwich  after minutes of waiting for the sandwich i asked the soccer mom behind the counter to which she replied hon they take a few minutes after another five minutes i got pissed it is a sandwich nobody asked them to make a rack of lamb bread meat cheese garnish and a few condiments pretty basic stuff right  when i finally complained to the bald guy in the bad hawaiian shirt who apparently runs the place he simply said sorry and made the sandwich in front of me amber the emo counter girl started to complain to me that they were busy and someone had called off bad hawaiian shirt guy sent her out to smoke i watched through the window as she commiserated with filthy cook guy and then returned to work without bothering to wash her hands gross again i would eat daily at the phoenix rescue mission before setting foot in hob nobs again at least there the staff is nice and want to help
what ever happened to fez  they used to be a good restaurant and i do my best to support local restaurants i hate writing a bad review but maybe by seeing this they will start to improve things at the restaurant lately the food has been average at best and the service is not only slow but rude on top of it tonight we waited minutes at the bar before we could get a drink and the restaurant was dead when we did get service the bartender gave tons of attitude and seem more interesated in servicing his friends sitting at the bar than servicing paying customers like us he never asked how our food was which had he done that he would have reaslized it was cold and to top it off when we noticed the bill was incorrect rather than an apology that he had made a simple mistake he choose to argue last time i went there i had poor food and service as well i thought that was isolated experience why gave it another chance but after tonight doubt i will anytime soon unless things improve
before i elaborate on the one star i do have to disclaim that the staff is extremely nice and helpful however that is not outweighed by the ridiculous highway location not to sound dramatic but it sounds like a nascar track outside and it does nt matter if you re not on the side that faces the highway also there s a weird wet smell in the hallways  that humid poollike smell even though there is nt a pool
food poisoning for two please i am really confused by all the star and star reviews for this place the star average yelp rating was the reason my wife and i chose to dine here during our stay in phoenix yelp you really let us down this time so i was on company business travel in phoenix the week of march th and my wife was traveling with me we had a french impulse that tuesday night and tried to crash petite maison in scottsdale only to find out that reservations were required and there were no tables available the following night still craving french cuisine we decided to stop in at sophie s french bistro in phoenix the first warning sign was that the place was entirely empty during peak dinner hours however encouraged by the strong reviews on yelp we decided to go ahead and order we took advantage of a couple of happy hour specials and ordered the following cheese plate chef s pate calamari crispy duck breast creme brulee the food was average at best my wife and i both tend to critique food as we eat it and we both found ourselves commenting that the portions were small and the food was overpriced for what it was most of what we ate was bland and the pate had a very odd flavor and consistency the fun started about hours later when we were back in our hotel room we both started experiencing various internal moaning and groaning followed by the onset of stomach pain no big deal i thought by shortly after midnight we were each fighting for time in the bathroom taking turns to vomit up everything we had eaten that night i ll try to spare you the details but this was the kind of violent and uncontrollable vomiting that i have only experienced perhaps once before in my entire life needless to say diarrhea was also involved after going through this for a good two hours my wife and i were both thoroughly exhausted and dehydrated my wife even told me she felt like she was dying and said that she had never felt this bad before  not even during child birth oo so by around am my wife was begging for me to call an ambulance for a while neither of us could get up off the floor to reach the telephone i eventually found a break in the vomiting and managed to sip down enough water to recover slightly i carried my wife out to the car and asked the hotel receptionist for directions to the nearest hospital we drove to john c lincoln hospital on dunlap which i recommend if you ever get poisoned by sophie s french bistro i managed to get there without hitting anything which was remarkable since i could barely see straight and could barely function at all once inside my wife completely collapsed and was unconscious briefly the nurses and doctors rushed her into the er and brought her back around they gave her a shot of morphine and then hooked her up to an iv drip of fluids as i waited i continued to experience vomiting and tried to keep myself hydrated despite being in a hospital i was determined not to check myself in for treatment not wanting to add further medical bills sometime around am my wife was ready to be discharged the official diagnosis was acute food poisoning we were never able to identify the specific meal at sophie s which poisoned us as we both shared the same courses and ate equal amounts each however  and this is the kicker  when the doctors asked us where we had eaten dinner and we told them it was sophie s they remarked oh that place we learned that the er at john c lincoln has seen other cases of food poisoning caused by sophie s the hospital took our information for the purpose of compiling a complaint against sophie s with the az department of health services they told us that once they have at least confirmed cases then they are required by law to report the incident as a disease outbreak this all would have been nice to know before we chose to dine at this place i can only assume that the other poisoning victims either do nt use the internet or are still laying in a pool of vomit somewhere too weak to write a review please please please do nt put yourself through the same hell that we went through that night after this experience we lost all desire to dine in phoenix ever again thanks sophie s for ruining our trip for the record we did have an excellent meal at cibo pizza the night before we were poisoned i highly recommend cibo great food without food poisoning
i have been to blanco a few times and i must say that every time i go the experience just gets worse and worse the last time i went was a couple weeks ago on a saturday and for a saturday night i was very disappointed the hostess said that our wait lrb for a person table rrb was going to be minutes we ended up waiting over an hour and a half and when we finally walked into the restaurant there were at least five open tables secondly the crowd was not what it used to be it used to be a very young hip and good looking crowd the crowd i witnessed was not so hot and to be honestly i was losing my appetite sitting next to some of these restaurant goers next after our very long wait it took forever to get our food we waited at least an hour for our meal which at pm at night is not okay at this point we were so tired of waiting we just wanted to go home and finally the food was nt that good the tacos were smothered in sour cream sauce and the salad had no taste at all it all tasted very bland do nt ever order the fajitas like most places they are nt healthy and grilled they come in a pan that has been drenched in oil not healthy and absolutely repulsive i would definitely not recommend this place to anyone and will never give blanco my business again
yesterday we went to bavarian point yes even after reading the poor reviews only because we make the effort to go once a year for a holiday easter we go there because we love good german cuisine well i should have listened to my inner voice we sat down in the back of the dining area and as soon as i sat down my eye spotted a filthy white ceiling tile bowed by moisture with dried mold on it the rest of the tiles are a maroon tone then we are waiting for our server and i swat two flying things the server was pleasant and complimentary we learned that the owner is going on vacation in july and they hope to fix up the place while he is gone all my life i have known german women and no selfrespecting german woman would have anyone walk into their home without it being spotless so i assume there are no german women in the owner s life the dust settled into the hanging light fixtures and the wood trim was splashed with discoloration now for the food  the spaetzle had no flavor the duck was way over cooked and the sauces were lackluster the place has gone from quaint to a true dump the salad bar was dismal and the entire experience made me physically ill i am writing this with much heaviness in my heart because we had been going there for years and this was the worst dining experience we have had in a very long time if he does not want to stay in business then he should just close up and go home if he wants to maintain his business then he should invest some money in a make over and clean up his place i did ask if they had an exterminator and the server said yes infatically i would find a new exterminator i am truly sorry but there are higher standards that should be followed i evern told the server that the board of health would shut them down in a heart beat
i live nearby so we thought we d drop by  big mistake we called so we could take it homeit began with them being out of a menu item then we had to press them to add a side lrb which comes with the meal rrb when we arrived they charged us for an extra entree and they were not very friendly when we pointed this out the meal was horrible the eggplant was soggy nothing like the picture and very small not at all worth the price the brownoli was blah lrb tasted like it came out of a box rrb we walked away feeling ripped off  we would never return here
ordered philly and steak was burnt fries over salted terrible
i ve purchased wood here for years and recommended this business to friends but today i pulled up to purchase a couple bags of wood and the employee who was supposed to be selling me the wood took a look at my obama bumber sticker took a few steps back and then said sarcastically well i guess i will still help you even though you voted for obama not only was this rude but none of your business you are in the business of selling wood and i guess also you are in the business of trying to insult your customers sour grapes cause your candidate lost the election  keep that to yourself sir and just load the wood in my car rude poor customer service inappropriate
i fly a lot and have been on various airlines but someone please explain to me something that boggles my mind i bought a ticket choose seats for my friend and me excited that i would nt have to sit next to a stranger for the long flight to chicago we were set for our trip after checking into my flight the seats that we chose was not what was on our boarding pass not even close huh  surely this is just a mistake so i politely talked to a boarding agent she advised me ever so rudely that the seats i chose were just a request and they did nt have to honor them wtf maybe i m slow i do nt understand from what i recall from any other airline lrb save southwest rrb when you buy your ticket and pick your seat that s the seat you get i understand that there may be seating changes to accommodate for families but why have your customers choose seats in the first place if you are just going to jumble them all around anyway  then to be told with such ambivalence that those are requested seats and that you should feel happy getting on a flight that the airline overbooked is tacky and ridiculous then as some sort of consolation they said i could pay an additional to sit in the emergency aisle just so that the person i booked my flight with originally and picked adjacent seats can sit together why would i give us airways another dime to sit in an exit seat i know they will just fill up because they constantly overbook us airways made me very cranky whatever savings you get with booking with them is nt worth the hassle and disappointment you ll get i doubt i ll be flying with them again
dirty bad service i stood in a line marked order here for an espresso coffee for ten minutes when i got to the front of the line the manager told me i was in the wrong line and had to go straight to the line under the sign pay here when i placed my order the baristacash register guy waited to start my drink until he rung up three people behind me i would have sat at a table but they were all too dirty i watched the barista make a mocha or something for the man in front of me the frothy milk that came from the silver bucket was chunky and gross that milk went cold and curdled and he served it anyway i was appalled i watched closely as mine was made the guy kept slapping the machine like it was broken or slow or something not impressed not coming back
why would you say you use  quality ingredients then toast a french roll in cheap grease  the mystery beef in your french dip was overcooked overpriced and not even close to  quality anybody who thinks  grease is great deserves to be obese terrible food
went in after along day of work to get a good pizza after watching the employees eat food with their fingers and not washing their hands after turned me off but thats not it they had their own drinks on the same counter where the pizza crust lays who knows what is on the bottom of those cups dont even want to give them a star so gross waste of dollars cause we threw the pizza away
slow very slow you would think for what they charge they would move a little faster slow sloowww sllloooowwww
pass the restaurant is as cold as a meat locker so your food is never warm the service is slow and i learned the hard way most people were not there for the food but the booze it felt like the cast of the jersey shore threw up all over this place
i havent been to pv mall for many years since moving to north scottsdale so it was a surprise to see how run down the place is the final straw for me was watching as a young man shook down a shopper in dillards for bus fare yes panhandling in the main aisle in dillards but even more impressive was overhearing one of the salespeople explain to another salesperson how it happens all the time and management does nt do anything about it i walked out of the store looking over my shoulder thinking the panhandler was following me out after having made eye contact with him and seeing him do a quick turnabout in my direction who needs that shit i will never go back to pv mall it is the new christown shame on you dillards management
came here on a supposed business hour but it was closed looked through the window and it does nt look to be in business anymore
not impressed the coffee is awful should nt it taste fresh brewed in the early am  for some reason i decided to get a breakfast bagel sandwich which was nothing special most importantly though the service sucked we were the only ones in line but the girl behind the counter said to us times i can help you down here when you re ready okay i get it i do nt see what her point was though cause she was rude and pushy when we did finally place an order
i saw this place on a show and me and my husbend decided to check it out i thought it would be fun to take my mother inlaw along as well when we got there we were blown away by how the place was set up was real creative our server took good care of us our food came pretty fast it was neat to be able to build your own however half way through our meals we had enough the food was way to greased up we all ended up getting sick after i think it might be because we were not used to eating that much junk food in one sitting it is worth checking out at least once but be careful what you order
if you know exactly what you want and need no assistance whatsoever and you happen to be lucky enough to find it in your size then by all means go here if you need any help whatsoever you d be better off wandering the parking lot for a knowledgeable squirrel this has happened every time we have gone there for shoes etc over the last several years so roughly times in the last or years today i went to buy new hiking boots and possibly rollerblades or roller skates not an employee in sight i located and tried on four pair of hiking boots and settled on one that i liked but wanted to try the next size up i could nt see any in the size i wanted but noticed the two shelves higher than what i could reach had several boxes behind the front boxes no ladders or stools anywhere no employees anywhere i eventually slid a bench over to the area climbed on top  looked for myself nope none in the next size up looked  looked for someone who worked there in hopes that they could call another store to see if they had that size in stock i gave up after lapping the store twice ok so forget the hiking boots i still would like blades or skates though rollerskates one pair for girls one for men no women s none rollerblades three different ones in stock all seemed really really crappy and one style was completely sold out which i will assume was the only decentlymade pair out of the bunch had some questions about the crappy ones but again not a soul in sight i give up zappos here i come also if you are a thief this is your place i am very confident i could have loaded a cart full of stuff  waltzed out the door i seriously wondered if the doors were accidentally left unlocked and the store was really supposed to be closed pm on a tuesday too unbelievable
my wife and i have heard a couple times that fleming s has a really good happy hour and since we recently moved into the vicinity we thought we d give it a try at about on a saturday afternoon our visit lasted exactly minutes that was long enough to have a seat at the bar and have the snobby bartender treat us like lepers for deigning to ask questions about the specials judging by his terse and unhelpful answers you re either in their little happy hour club and already have the options memorized or you re out so do nt bother him i do nt know if the bartender is trying to apply the jehovah s witness heaven limit to the number of people allowed to enjoy fleming s happy hour or if he was annoyed that he could nt carry on an uninterrupted conversation with a coworker about scheduling work hours or if he s just a knob but we were interested in having a nice little time out not cracking some bartenderinduced secret code of happy hour enlightenment so we got up and left we went across the lot to another restaurant and were treated to friendly service great food and good drinks at a real happy hour with happy people
i like the sandwhiches and salads but they do not have any low fat balsamic vinegrette dressing thats the only king of dressing i like last time i was there i had to eat my salad without dressing and soda i had was totally flat
worst customer service i have ever had if you have any requests the answer will be no the guy manager could care less about people so do nt waste your time this is not from one single event i used to be a regular but finally gave up on this place after being dissapointed time after time
i decided to try this place for breakfast you go in and order and then they give you a number and you sit and wait for your food i ordered the breakfast quesadilla with chorizo it was very bland and really greasy maybe i shoulda waited and went next door to the farmhouse again next time i will
selection at bevmo is extensive but their prices are a bit high comparatively the reason for the single star is the unhelpfulness of both the person who rang our order up and and nasty attitude of the manager who was called over to assist basically bevmo no longer accepts out of state identification lrb of course in az where practically everyone is from out of state rrb the manager was called over to approve the sale he took his sweet time to appear lrb like minutes rrb the proceeded to test us on what was on our licenses on top of checking them no more thouroughly than the checker he blamed some new arizona law but that is simply not true or all area businesses would cease to accept out of state ids stay away from bevmo unless you want to feel like you are an illegal immigrant stealing alcohol total wine is the place to go

this place is terrible the inexperienced front desk people care about nothing other then selling some of them are busy doing personal texting they have let go of teachers the classes are too crowded and they make you do a membership if you want to use the equipment the teachers at best pale in comparison to la instructors i have had corporate america at the expense of personal attention and staff that really could care less
this place plainly sucks unless you have not taste for great mexican food than you should go here the food was discussing and the black beans were way undercooked which he said that s because they were for the salad lrb i want them cook even for my salad rrb nothing like a cold crunchy bean the salsa was way to runny and had no flavor but the chili powder or what ever was it in it s not worth the price they want gross gross gross

as you can see this place already has only three stars i wish my one star contribution could be a negative stars but we all know that s not possible this place has absolutely no respect for any of their customers they say that they take pride in their customer service but is robbing a customer of dollar good service  the owner and manager completely ignored what i was trying to say and kept asking for the money that should have been discounted it is their responsibility to deal with third party companies like restaurantcom on deals with their food but no they simply told me to deal with it wtf  is this serious  they just took an extra on top of my already over priced food not to mention the waiters and waitresses paid no attention at all this is no exception for any restaurant we the customers should always come first treating people like this eventually gets you re business shut down stand with me yelp
this was an incredible opportunity to spend and hours for beers it was impossible to get food with the hour long lines at each of the trucks the trucks did nt anticipate the massive crowd and ran out of food the event was completely overbooked
do you love big sloppy pieces of pork fat covered in barbecue sauce  if so please come here i ll be as nice as i can since i ve only been here once and only had one item i had open faced pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw the pork was sliced thin but was  fat and no not just one piece of pork but the entire plate of it yuck they must have forgot to add the dressing to the coleslaw because it was bone dry yummy i love raw plain cabbage how did they know  i ll give them the benefit of the doubt and say i just got a bad hunk of meat because there is no way this place could serve food like that and stay in business if they change their name to my big plate of pork fat with sauce it would better suit the meal i was served  rereading my own review and now i m pissed that i did nt send it back i should have damn it
yikes this food was terrible super greasy tasteless pizza i got a cold turkey sandwich and it looked absolutely nothing like the huge poster in the window advertising their sandwiches i could have made the equivalent at home for onequarter the price the best thing about our dining experience was the free wifi and the tasty soda lrb which seems hard to find these days a carbonated nonwatered down soft drink rrb
i had experienced first hand why it s not a good idea to slide down a banister drunk and cracked the crystal on my favorite watch after finally getting around to getting it fixed i contacted the watch repair company  i call the shop asking about a price quote and eta on when it would be fixed i m told it would be and it would be finished wednesday lrb  rrb  almost a week after i was told the watch would be fixed i call the shop i am told that the watch is not finished but it would be the next day lrb  aka christmas eve rrb surprised that he would work on christmas eve i am told the watch would be ready between pm  pm i call the shop and am told that he just needs to get the watch put back together but it would be ready by frustrated i let him know i would be there at that time after the watch repair company had fallen through twice i was starting to get pretty frustrated with their complete lack of contact or clarity on when my watch would be fixed the only guy that runs this place is almost completely impossible to understand mumbling in sort of a primitive way no matter i was especially excited to have my watch back  pm i walk into the shop and let him know i am there to pick up my watch he pulls it out of a sleeve mumbling i got it cleared on out i can give you a call when the crystal comes in and hands me the same exact thing i had given him two weeks ago the crystal was still cracked after all that nothing had been done i am completely speechless grab the watch and head for the door he mumbles there s no charge on that i still have no idea what to say what a complete waste of time i have absolutely no idea how this place is still in business
very busy some of the employees are rude and my hubby needed some asthma pills which they have a card you have to give the pharmacy and they lady was well not very smart
terrible some of the worst service and worst pizza i ve ever had
this del taco is an absolute wreck i understand that i am getting what i pay for and considering their tacos are under cents each i am not complaining about the food the staff on the other hand is a different story it does not matter whether one works at del taco or boeing customer service is very important every time i visit this del taco it never fails that these people always get my order wrong or do not give me what i asked for i visited them yesterday for a quick dinner as it had been a long day and they are always fast in the drivethru my order was completely wrong and when i specifically asked for a certain sauce three times the manager failed to give it to me no one ever speaks english and i struggle to understand what they are saying when i did call to complain about the service the manager accused me of not telling the truth which in turn i became livid with her i drove back up there and showed her what she did wrong and she still had an attitude about fixing it i will never go to this del taco again and i advise that if one seeks good customer service they avoid this place also i will drive to the one on tatum and bell if i feel the need for some del taco

let me preface my review by stating a few facts  my boyfriend and his family are chinese and they were dining with me  the aforementioned chinese people in my party ordered everything for us in the spirit of authentic chinese cuisine  i put on a happy face and ate as much rice as i could to fill up rrb i like to start any decent meal with a good handwashing especially when eating with my chinese inlaws when they re in town from china i went into the bathroom at diamond s and i almost hurled i am a mortician and around putrid smells every day of my life so for the smell of a bathroom to turn my stomach is reeeally saying something i felt obligated to stay and eat i left the bathroom and used antibacterial hand sanitizer instead lrb so the food began to appear we ordered a big pot of oolong tea to accompany our meal we were warned that it along with the glasses of water on our table was tap water the steamed white rice was fine and dandy and i ate most of it we got dungeness crab served chopped up but still in the shell and smothered in a brown gravy sauce that was nonetootasty and killed the delicious crab taste we also had lobster that was similarly served chopped into pieced and smothered in sauce with the meat still inside this method of serving made it difficult to handle the food without getting your hands dirty including serving it to yourself from the lazy susan we also had cod with all the bones in it and the eyeballs still in its head completely intact i did not even taste it as i ve had some bad experiences with fish bones the rest of the table ate the whole thing including the fish brain and eyeballs and cheeks  shudder  just a matter of personal preference but i ca nt do that all in all i would never go back ever and i d advise anyone with a weak stomach or a strong sense of smell to avoid this place at all costs again this is simply my preference and opinion but i like to taste my food not just the seasoned gravy thrown onto it and the smell oh good heavens check please
service apocalypse to the feather flying fedorawearing i m  goingtowearavestandlongsleeveseventhoughit s  stillhotout andit s  not hipster server go to your local library pick up some literature on proper etiquette might i suggest emily post  uh oh too much text for your weary hipster eyes  spent all day giving customers the stinkeye did nt you  ok i ll break it down for you when people sit down at a table try to greet them if you re super tied up between checking up on other tables and checking your appearance in the mirror then maybe just let that table know that you are busy and that you will be with them shortly because after we were seated at our table almost minutes went by  no waiter nothing we were beginning to get worried we thought perhaps you had been kidnapped we called the authorities but we had little information to go off of since you never came by and said hi we described you as a tall malnourished hipster wearing teengirl skinny jeans an overwhelming ensemble of man accessories and air of mismatched cocky arrogance for a year old dude at the lower end of the service industry unfortunately that description did us no good in the neighborhood of cenpho  but luckily when we were just about at our wits end you showed up hunched over scowl on your face lrb if this is in preparation for your costume as a zombie you are rocking it rrb when you serve people drinks let them finish said drinks before hastily removing them from the table if they kindly ask you for their drinks back try not to be an ass when customers order dinner try not to take so long so as to confuse them into thinking it s breakfast when the food is served maybe do nt go mia maybe check back in with them maybe they want dessert for wait what time is it now lunch  ok i ll stop there i know how valuable time is to the pretentious staff at the windsor those cigarettes are nt going to smoke themselves well congratulations from now on we will avoid your restaurant like you avoid a real job
well on this particular visit the associate in the men s department was pretty douchey the associate was busy racking items and i guess did not see us approaching him as he walked back and forth putting clothes out when we got close enough my bf asked him about a particular brand of clothing and with hardly any recognition replied in a rude and unprofessional manner really did nt make me or my boyfriend want to spend any money in this store on to the next store rrb
do nt buy nike sneakers if you want to return or exchange them i ve bought many from them i went this week and bought pairs of nike sb s that were already over retail price as it is i tried on one side then bought them when i got home i realized that one of the shoes were damaged it s only been days and they said they ca nt take it back i ve bought many shoes there and this will be the last time i m from nor cal and people are crazy about sneakers out there and all the shops will accept a return or exchanged within  days this was the first place that does not do that why  because sneakers and sb s are not big in az they do nt sell here i would nt buy them there if i were you
i had a stand by appointment for a certain day which gets you a cheaper trip charge they did not show up that day and asked me to reschedule so i did now i understand why they charge a trip charge it s because they are so overpriced that i m sure that a lot of people send them away once they hear what they want to charge it was about double what another company quoted me without charging me a trip charge i had to pay for the service guy to come to my house and show me their outrageous prices because they wouldnt give me a quote over the phone their price list is a no fuss one price only so i really do nt understand why they could nt give me a quote over the phone the trucks are really nice looking though the service guy that came to my house was nice and knowledgeable
three different occassions i have gone to purchase items at this location and all three times they were out of stock the third time i even called in advance and was told the merchandise i was looking for was in stock the clerk when i asked would nt even go in the back to see if there was additional supply that had nt been put on the shelves these were not on sale items  i was looking for every day computer andor video cables and components save yourself a trip make the trip to the best buy in surprise or to the one on i  thunderbird
i ve been using this service for two years and i kept expecting it to get better but it never has for some reason that s beyond my understanding they ca nt seem keep their website up to date based on their current stock it seems to me that since the whole premise of this service is that you can order groceries online that they should at least have the site current that s a minor inconvenience unless you re missing the ingredient you need to make your planned meal or you do nt have body wash etc if you re the type of person who likes to live on edge never knowing if the items you ordered are going to arrive this might be the perfect service for you you might even find it exciting if so then there you go you can thank me later for the tip this is all sort of annoying but was nt a deal breaker for me what is a deal breaker is that recently we ve occasionally not received our orders at all there have been several occasions where they over book their drivers and we do nt find out until pm that our order wo nt be arriving or even once their system accidentally deleted my entire order keep in mind that if you want to schedule a redelivery the next day lrb and you have a job so you need an evening appt rrb you ll need to allow them a hour window to fit you in which means if you had plans that evening their shot all of sudden this service that is supposed make my life so much easier is more of a hassle then driving to the store i would avoid it maybe one day they ll figure it out or better yet maybe fry s will get on board and do it right that d be nice oh ps their customer service call center sucks
i wasted weeks in trying to book a bus i contacted them asking for quote which was pretty reasonable considering they would have to travel from az to ca i talked to them briefly on the phone to understand what the steps were in order to book a bus and the final result was just email brandon fulton back with confirmation that we were going to reserve it and they would send over a contract shortly i waited a day and then contacted again and was told by him that a contract is on it s way then more days go by and he tells me they do nt have a driver so they will let us know i contact them the next day asking if they found one he contacts me back a day later saying just want to confirm it was for i go yes will the contract be coming he sends me an email saying thanks i m think what is that a yes no finally he sends me an email of an invoice and says fill this out fill what out  there is no place for a signature or any information i send an email with no response and then he contacts me asking if i still needed the bus with only days before we need to take off needless to say we went another company who was fabulous professional and quick to respond my overall question is how does a company like this stay afloat in this economy when it s obvious they could careless about how they treat the paying customer
ghetto mostly dead not much selection you can walk through it in less than ten minutes

stumbled upon this place around dinner time and decided to give it a try bad decision i will first give you the worst my fiance had explosive diarrhea all night after eating here he ordered ichi roll i wish i had read the review on this restaurant then i would have avoided this place the other reviewer has described this ichi roll i completely agree gross in addition to what he described this roll is huge the size of a burger patti no roll should be so big that you ca nt fit in your mouth that just goes to show the chef does not know japanese cuisine i ordered dragon roll which is eel and avocado overall flavor is okay but the texture of the fish is mushier than usual that it makes me think perhaps it s not fresh the green tea watered down not much flavor edamame tasted like store bought edamame but it s the kind that s overstocked and about to expire you get the idea so will i come back to this restaurant  you tell me
went for coffee at this mcdonalds today three of their rising stars were in the drive through line eividently the microphone at the menu had the day off with three of their brightest doing the work of a sign and a microphone the line was backed up and getting worse by minute the courtesy of the staff was beyond lacking and the dolts who lined up for mcdonalds was scary i went inside to get my coffee having given up on the helpful trio in the drive through only to be met by the team who were nt good enough to qualify for the parking lot gig i would recommend dumpster diving over going to this restaurant unless you are in a coma or have nothing else better to do i would avoid this place wow
got the woojito at happy hour it was terrible tasted like old lemonage shame on me for expecting a good mixed drink at a sushi place but it was like degrees and i just wanted a mojito the rolls were pretty solid but we ordered salmon roe w  a quail egg on top and when it came out the yolks of the quail egg were solid it was really gross we sent them back and it took about minutes to get a new batch the new batch at least had normal yolks but still tasted a bit funky the waitress did nt really ever show any concern even when we told her the second batch was bad instead she just dropped off our check with the full charge on it at that point we told her that the eggs needed to come off she took the check to her manager and came back and took one of three salmon roes off and two of six quail eggs off since we had eaten some are you freaking kidding me  we had to eat it to know it was bad we paid for our meal because we just wanted to get out of there but i could nt let it go so i asked to see the manager when the manager came out she seemed a bit concerned and offered to refund the rest of the eggsroe that was ok but all in all i felt like the staff could have been more sympathetic and accommodating lrb sorry have to cut this review short as i have to go to my jousting tournament rrb
i wish i had read the previous review before this place suck inside was hot gotta be  degree i was uncomfortable the whole dame time the bath room stink i ca nt imagine what their kitchen would look like what a ssham
the pharmacy here is very incompetent and i have run into countless problems here that i have never experienced at another walgreen s or any other pharmacy every time i have a prescription filled or transferred they make a colossal mistake today was for sure my last time using them lrb or trying to use them rrb i do not recommend going here especially with so many other options nearby
i had color copies made here the staff did not know the prices and then they charged me for me to use their computer to access the file from my flash drive the computer was so out of date it could not even read a word file when i looked at the copies the next morning they were misaligned and the print quality looked like a poor inkjet rather than a laser print i called them and they said they would have to talk to the manager when i went back after the weekend he was not there and the clerk would not give me a refund poor equipment poor attitude poor customer service there are other ups stores relatively close i suggest you use those i will stick to my local one in ahwatukee
what a joke i took my girlfriends car to this place because of some tire issues that we were having on her car there was an obvious object stuck in the tire and their was obvious separation drove their on a saturday the guy working said they could nt do anything so sent me home driving home that is also my tire pressure light was still on after they said they filled up the tire oh and the only reason i even came to this place was she had purchased the tires here a year before and also bought the worthless warranty anyways dropped the car off the next day at the scheduled time sat in the waiting room that claimed to have free wifi that did nt work anyways after an hour and a half of waiting the manager i believe comes in and tells me exactly what he told me the day before except now he says i need new struts he said he did nt have the tires we needed and he would call me the next business day well that day has passed and even with the warranty from goodyear we ended up going to discount they took care of us in a professional manner what a waste of time do nt go here
do nt come durning spring training they do nt take reservations and you will wait for bad service and marginal food  lrb
we love going to the lolos at the downtown location but had a really bad experience at this one we were around the area and was craving fried chicken so we though we d stop by this location is completely different from the downtown location there is no service here after being seated we waited a while to get our drink order and after the drink order no one came by to take our order there was  staffs behind the counter and staffs on the floor and no one seemed to give a crap after waiting for over mins lrb which is really long when you re starving already rrb we decided to walk out of the restaurant and go somewhere else
it s am and my baby needs his medicine in the morning we refilled it online and went to pick it up and although it says that there s one refill on the online prescription manager and the bottle they refused to fill it and told us they needed to call our ped classy we re switching pharmacies asap
worst pulled pork sandwich ever had to ask for extra bbq sauce but still did nt kill the taste slow service as well no reason to return
wow to say they are lacking in customer service skills would be an understatement this guy lacks people skills and actlikeanadult skills they advertised free estimates and then complained when they got to my house even though i gave him our address a week prior he asked personal questions regarding what we paid for our house and what our payments were he wanted to be left alone to wander around the property he was way overpriced and when i told him later thank you but he was not the bid we were going to go with i began receiving rude text messages about me and my husband he seemed to be most upset with the fact that we were getting more than estimate and had not chosen to go with dirt works i do nt know of many people that get only estimate for a big job and i would think contractors knew that he was super offended and said i knew you were nt serious about having the work done actually we were and went with a different company immediately he then stated that my husband was rude and weird because he insisted on walking the property with him rather than having this group of people coming in and out they may seem ok at first but please beware he acts like a ticking timebomb and i would nt let this guy anywhere near my house
one of these just opened by my house and my husband and i were really excited to try it because everyone says such great things i was so disappointed i agree that the fries were limp and i m a crispy fry lover the burger tasted good but i felt pretty ill shortly after eating it not food poisoning ill  more like overgreased ill i do nt really eat fast food so maybe that s it but i will not be returning
service is beyond sub par brunette waitress who appears to be pregnant acts like taking your order is inconvenient my food sat in the window while the cook rang the bell over and over and she walked up and yelled how many times are you going to ring the bell not surprisingly food was lukewarm but not poorly prepared feel sorry for the kitchen since cold food and long waits clearly are nt their issue several people in the bar were overserved to the point of a drunken stupor lrb illegal in scottsdale rrb fight almost broke out between two men next to me needs real management likely a candidate for the show bar rescue
after reading all the star reviews i was excited to visit the wandering horse buffet the place is clean and the food is nicely displayed and the service is very nice unfortunately the food itself was a different story the chinese food section was on par with panda express their fried rice was nt good either the mexican food did nt look appetizing at all so i skipped it altogether the prime rib was tender but flavorless everything looks so fancy how can it taste so mediocre  the desserts reminded me of home town buffet i went on a wednesday evening so i do nt know what they have on weekends but i did nt see any sushi crab legs or oysters overall i would nt go there again for i expect better quality food even golden corral is better at half the price my favorite buffet is pacific seafood buffet read my review of it to find out why
my feet were frozen in place i could nt back out now my friend dragged me into this place for karaoke as soon as i walked in the door i wanted to turn around and walk back out this place is  the dive gay bar in town there was some horrid karaoke going on in the front and some incoherent benefit show going on in the back the patio seemed nice enough but not a soul out there  cept drag queens smoking as soon as this guy started  singing some song from phantom we knew it was time to go could nt stand another second in this place just not my scene my friend was irritated we wanted to leave
never again lrb at this location rrb friday night was rough on the way back from the bar i blew out a tire and changed it on the side of the road at am by the time i got that taken care of and got everyone home it was nearly i was spent and needed a little sustenance taco bell is almost closed so where else to go  i channeled the old college student within and went to whataburger whatamistake come to think of it i ve had a couple sketchy experiences at this location lrb ie undercooked meat etc rrb but alcohol andor exhaustion must have clouded my judgement being the only customer in the drive thru getting a single burger should not have taken this long i would say it may have taken longer since they were adding a slice of cheese they so graciously charged and additional cents for but wait they neglected to put it on at all after taking one bite it all became clear it took so long because they must have been shaking a salt shaker above it for at least minutes gross never again
i absolutely despise this target every single time i go in there they are out of stock on half of the items i need last time i was looking for something specific lrb over the door mirror rrb i looked on line and it said they were in stock i called the store they then confirmed they were in stock i get to the store lrb i live minutes away rrb yep not one in stock another experience went like this bought worth of crap get home and the dog food containers i purchased lrb which says so on my receipt rrb are not there i call and they ask me to recall what register i was at is this on the receipt  no how the hell am i supposed to remember they then tell me they will look around and if they see them i can come back and get them no one ever called when i called back they told me to come in when i went in the manager argued with me are you sure blah blah it took calls and hours of my time to get the dog food containers i paid bucks each for i m glad others are having better experiences here but for me this target sucks
i guess it s time to update this review after my most recent experience i m not a complicated diner neither is my wife but for some reason at white chocolate grill at least this particular location getting the orders right has always been a problem on my last visit that problem was escalated by their jerk of a general manager and that s where i drew the line and decided to never go back so what happened  my wife orders the chicken sandwich with only lettuce and tomato pretty simple right  unfortunately not as had become painfully commonplace at this location the sandwich shows up wrong there is cheese on it which my wife absolutely detests i sent it back immediately with the food runner as our server was lrb of course rrb not present when the food came out the server showed up minutes later to find me starring at my own food as it got cold while my wife had no plate at all when he inquired what happened i unloaded and told him that for what was probably the fourth time they d botched a simple request to get us a plain sandwich with just lettuce and tomato it s always something either the cheese or they leave everything on it you name it they ve done it he tells me he ll send the manager over the manager indeed came over corrected sandwich in hand about minutes later after dropping it on the table and following a contrite absolutely insincere apology he attempted to slink off before i could say anything i stopped him and asked why this continues to be a problem why it is so difficult at this restaurant but no other i ve ever been to to get a simple order correct the manager starts his tirade with the words i do nt want to argue with you sir but and then launches into this ridiculous explanation about how it s actually our fault for ordering it wrong in his world a chicken sandwich is like a cheeseburger and when you order it plain it still comes with cheese i pointed out that this made no sense since it is nt a cheesesandwich and there s no expectation that it should come with cheese when ordered plain or  only with etc he shrugged it off argued further that cheese is on the meat and the lettuce tomato onion and may is on the other side with the bun so therefore somehow cheese is not a condiment like all the rest so it made sense to include cheese when we asked for lettuce and tomato only no i am not making this stuff up but that is absolutely what he said when i asked him how to correct the problem on future visits given his outlook on how we re too stupid to order properly he said no lie you need to tell the server you want to order a chicken sandwich plain then specify no cheese then ask them to add lettuce and tomato i almost fell out of the chair my wife and i just stared at him blankly said o k and with that he made another insincere well sorry and off he went can you believe this clown  and no he did not comp us on any part of the meal not even in part the server had the nerve to ask if we were going to order dessert as well and showed us the menu no it was not an offer of a free dessert for the trouble it was an upsell apparently my wife and i left a tip and a note for the server to get the rest of his tip from the manager that had the sheer nerve to argue with a customer i complained directly to the corporate office in scottsdale and believe it or not this joke of a general manager even argued with the customer relations person his explanation for his actions when she followed up with him  we get people complaining if we ask too many questions like whether or not they also want the cheese really  you have got to be kidding me i have never in my life seen someone tell a server that they asked too many questions is that the best line he could come up with  given that the manager is such a complete douche that he even argues with corporate rather than apologize i have absolutely no intention of ever bringing my business back to this place mind you i ve been going to this location for over a year and have taken numerous people with me including family friends and coworkers heck i even arranged a person party on their patio at one point this flunky cost himself a lot of business by treating us this way and i ve made sure to tell as many people about my experience as possible since i work nearby there are plenty of good restaurants in the same plaza i suggest you check them out before you waste your time and money giving patronage to an establishment that is managed by a complete troglodyte with the customer service skills of a mongol barbarian absolutely unacceptable and i hope the owners get rid of this clown before he costs them anymore business
so my car had been vibrating for about a week and i thought i needed an alignment so i took it to the nearest place i could find that did alignments after price checking around turns out their prices are about average for that kind of thing so i went to them after they looked it over they said my steering gear assembly was bad and that my tires were moving almost inches independently of one another because of this the alignment would nt be any good until i got it fixed they also said my front tires were bad and needed to be replaced lrb which was true i knew that for a while rrb safe to say i was scared for my car they quoted me for everything luckily i never do anything without a second opinion so i dropped in on my family mechanic bill at black canyon automotive in north phoenix while i was in the neighborhood the next day he put it on the lift he brought me under the car with him and he pointed out that there was nothing wrong with the steering gear the tires were moving perfectly with one another and an alignment was nt the issue the vibration was from a bubble in my front driver side tire because one of the tires belts was broken i went to discount tire got new tires and all was well for only thinking back i realize how bold faced the lie purcell s fed me was i mean if my tires were moving inches independently of one another the car could nt make it out of the parking lot forget about slight vibrations over mph these guys are liars and crack pots avoid them
i heard so many good thing about gb so i took a group of friends to work our way through all the offerings between the seven of us we ordered everything that came around some of it was out of this world and we desperately tried to remember which cart had what we liked so we could order more the best was better than anything i ve had in san francisco or new york too many of the plates were terrible some because they had been steaming or sitting too long or reheated too many times and a few because the ingredients were absolutely the very cheapest i ve seen outside a school cafeteria about half of the plates were just inedible effectively this doubled the price of the meal and soured us to the dishes we should have savored i wo nt go back unless it s with someone who knows which chef is working
i was happy to find a couple pairs of purple slacks  which i had nt seen in there for years but on the way out i slipped in a puddle of what appeared to be spilled soap i did nt fall just slid but it scared me yikes there was only one person ahead of me in line so as soon as she was done i notified the cashier about the spill he did nt look too concerned so i added if an older person falls in that it s automatic broken bones still no reaction guaranteed i said he proceeded to ring up my items as one then two more customers came up behind me i warned them to watch out for the puddle after i paid he hollared to someone to get somebody over for a cleanup i went to find a manager at customer service the gal would nt call a manager but listened to me relate the situation i told her the safety of your customers should have been more important than me than ringing up my sale before cleaning it up or marking it to warn others i was willing to wait i still did nt feel like was being taken seriously so here i am telling it again is anybody listening 
we were not greeted when we walked in the door the lady running the counter gave us a surly look and went back to restocking the counter items then after she changed the small garbage bucket while wringing garbage juice off her hand she asked what we wanted we just stopped in for a snack and i had wanted to try their food so we ordered the sliders to share along with some sweet potato fries and a tea no thank you or smile or anything we were obviously just in her way our sliders arrived with sweet potato fries that were obviously sitting out for the day cold lifeless and disgusting i went back inside and asked for a fresh batch and got dirty looks from everyone while waiting for the fresh fries we ate the sliders which were pretty good the burger bun onions and cheese were tasty something i d be happy having again but not with service like this and i also noticed that mid afternoon while the staff stood behind the grill eating lrb people observed eating while working one was garbage juice hand girl rrb the main garbage remained overflowing with disgusting refuse spattered on the white garbage stand ick while the sliders were fine and the fresh fries were pretty decent the service attitude people eating during their shift and lack of clean up were not something i d like to plan my meal around i predict an upcoming health code violation no gold or silver stars in their future
my coworkers do nt want to go to first watch anymore because they think it s too expensive they re right it no longer is a restaurant it s a restaurant you ca nt have a meal and a drink in there for less than that s for the cheapest choices get something more expensive or get a side or a la carte and you are easily in the  range  for breakfast get real first watch so for that kind of money i expect the best food and service and even some ambiance you ll get none of the above as others here say things used to be better and they are going downhill i have my theories which i will offer soon on a tues at am the place maybe  full i waited mins after being seated to get a coffee the waitress kept disappearing for extended periods making brief darting appearances into the dining room like a mouse carefully foraging at night the other tables were experiencing the same neglectful treatment and people kept having to reask for water coffee juice etc my food arrived a skillet and it was bleh the potatoes were cold the mushrooms were almost uncooked and the ham was in tiny cubes less than mm in size and stingy in portion the dish did nt taste seasoned and it did nt taste cooked so much as microwaved the eggs were cooked well though something that totally ticks me off about many breakfast places that first watch does is to not provide any combo breakfasts that include pancakes the only way to get them is as a head explodingly overpriced side  for one pancake this is clearly in ripoff territory and that s all that should be said about it ripoff for you might expect real maple syrup but you will get synthetic syrup and margarine my pancake made of dollars was good but again when you pay this much money your expectations are justifiably raised and they were nt met my coffee creamers were gone and i could nt get anybody s attention to get some more at one point my waitress went to another table near mine she looked at me and i looked at her to get her attention and she just turned around and walked the other direction during my stay the waitress was at my table x  once to seat me once to take my order and a rd time to bring my food i never saw her otherwise after i d eaten i still did nt have my check so i walked up to the cashier i encountered another waitress who was sniffing and rubbing her nose  not the most waitressy thing to do in sight of your customers i was asked repeatedly how the food and service were and i said it was nt good they immediately tried to discount my bill lrb i refused rrb but at the same time they would nt listen to me as i tried to explain what the specific shortcomings were they just kept trying to give me freebies i cut the waitress off and said i want you to listen to why i did nt like my meal not to offer me comps note that another reviewer mentioned that one of the waitresses was sweating i noticed another talking nonstop and another one snuffling make of it what you will suggestions  reduce prices by at least   combo breakfasts that include a range of choices including pancakes the menu is too rigid  reduce pancake prices by half make them even cheaper if purchased as a side to another meal  quick beverage service  more comfortable seating  a policy to have wait staff checking on customers throughout the meal  random drug testing for waitstaff i think it would solve a lot of problems
very disappointed with this place they do have many pretty things to purchase but the customer service is terrible i walked in and neither of the two associates greeted me two customers walked in right after me and they were both not only greeted but asked if they could be helped when i walked out and right passed the sale associate there was again no acknowledgment i was ready to make a purchase at this store but the customer service really made me reconsider
came here with a friend on a tuesday when they do  gold fish racing the lady who mc s the whole thing was extremely vulgar and offensive if you enjoy seeing people made fun with racist and sexist comments and jokes you might enjoy this place until you become the target of the remarks
run away i would of given back the dollar gift card if i could of avoided the food poisoning
horrible food tasteless watery just plain awful do nt go
do nt waste your time or money
i love tacos and i love trying out different restaurants that serve them my husband and i went to barrio queen yesterday afternoon for lunch we both left very disappointed and hungry first we tried the el rey vasito de elote which we were anxious to try since we ve had this dish before in another restaurant this dish came out in a smallish cup and it was served with nothing no chips i guess we were supposed to eat this with a spoon like some kind of corn pudding this dish has always been served with chips at other places why not at the barrio queen  must say it really was nt that good and we did nt finish it we both ordered tacos and they were just ok such a rip off these small bite street tacos these tacos were served with salsas if you can call these small containers of the most watered down salsa i ve ever seen and absolutely no taste no chunks of tomatoes peppers nothing i find it funny the runner who brought out the salsa warned the red was spicy this place will be a hit with tourists since it s in a prime location the tourists can have this place we will never be back
way over priced they have the nerve to charge the same prices as safeway across the street when they have a fraction of the operating costs the location is a dump we re talking old they have no more than two checkers on at any time  even prime postwork shopping with a extra they can call in when the lines start working their way down the aisles deli food is meh and mostly dried out by the time you get off work bakery is horrible everything tastes like it came from a box mix a bad box mix you d think with a whole store of ingredients like real flour and real milk and real butter a store bakery would actually bake real food lrb pet peeve of mine rrb
i completely agree w  john d i am from out of town but i have eaten my fair share of pizza in the west valley over the past yrs  this place sucks horrible food horrible service they messed up my ordered  did nothing to fix the problem sauce  toppings were not good avoid this place at all cost
i wanted to like this place because everyone else did the decor and feel of the place is top shelf for a coffee joint couches loungers hidden nooks and corners books galore but that s where the cool factor stops we were the only ones there on a late saturday morning with one male employee and female employees the male lrb i ll refer to him as boss because that s what he called all the males coming in the shop rrb was beyond rude socially  no tact at all with the several loud and obnoxious conversations we heard him having with the girls we overheard the f bomb being dropped several times with a few belches thrown in the middle the most talked about topic amongst the four of them had to do with monkey penises and at one point he went ballistic and started cursing about some political topic i seriously think they forgot we were there when i came out from behind the corner to get a business card to email the owner they moved from behind the counter to behind the door in the kitchen of course when i went to the bathroom i could hear them in the kitchen still talking about monkey penises there was also some serious pda happening with boss and one of the girls behind the counter the lack of professionalism in this place knocked what could ve been a down to a fire boss and i ll think about bringing my business back oh and my large skinny iced latte had to go back for more flavor and still was nt anything to brag about
dirty so dirty hair in the french fries dirty cook sitting on the counter dirty undercoooked hamburger meat and the server s fingers in my food dirty flies on the lip of the water pitcher dirty somehow these guys think that if you wear gloves you are spared from all contamination as if scratching your ass with your gloves on will keep the ass germs from getting in your food i ve been there before and have tried to look past all these things when eating such delicious food but really it s not worth it anymore
had to wait in line over an hour meanwhile other car rental counters were open and available when i finally got to talk to a clerk that spent minutes trying to upsell me after i had prepaid for everything online
take your money elsewhere unless you ve got kids i really try to like this place a family member signed me up for the discount card so i ve been going more often but i just do nt love it it s simply ok but the prices are outrageous and the sounds and animatronics are a huge distraction from the soso food the cocktails are alright but again the price is not right the ony thing fun about the place for an adult is the gift shop and the lightup cocktail glasses lrb which cost extra rrb i ve seen a lot of happy families in here though so i bet it s better if you have little ones to bring along
not so impressed i ve known this place existed other veg s have recommended it it was where i wandered off to after my first attempt to start my day in disaster cute atmosphere i felt i wandered into a homey kitchen but that was it  nothing more after that but disappointment here is my list of issues as a sustainability student all the styrofoam sucked  homey kitchen and with employees  nobody can think the experience would be made uber chic with mix and match shabby chic thrift store found dinner ware  sustainability point  localavore it ladies  than advertise it loudly  proudly sustainability point  all the beverages in milk gallons lined up like a fleet in an ice bath on the counter was not so pretty either really in a place so homespun breakfast ends  i asked about the breakfast rolls  sounded interesting but it was not allowed as it was  breakfast ended at however moments later granny s girls flooded into the kitchen  other employees   and granny offered them the left over soyrizo that was explained to me was an ingredient in the breakfast i could not have after looking in the window and seeing all the unhealthy mayo laden salads my choice was a veggie tamale  it did not kill me but it did not make me happy laying there like dog food that was just slid out of a can  sorry this was my first impression  lying in its sauce on the cheapest foam plate imaginable not pretty this was just food to make a turd  not much more actually it was brown like turd the description boasted tri color masa and veggies were the veggies ground into the masa  there was never any veggie filling so i guess it was turd all digested together to give my digestive track a break  while granny was pouring my glass of lemonade i spied guacamole on the menu guac makes me happy granny said oh no not today  it is the day before a long weekend  if i made guac  there were no customers it would go to waste but here are some avocados i can give you some slices sorry granny i ve worked in places that did tableside guacamole do nt limit yourself last on the list those aforementioned younger ladies that seemed to dart in and out as a career waitress with my own grandmother lrb that would have put a crack in my ass the other direction for doing anything perceived foul in the kitchen rrb i know better than to wear tank tops in the kitchen  exposed armpits not so kitchenspectacular another homey touch that would really add to the experience  vintage aprons  another great thrift store find good luck ladies sometimes i can give a place the baseball test strikes before their out sorry got to cut the losses directly here wo nt be back
went on a late tuesday afternoon i ca nt imagine what this place looks like on a weekend would nt it make more sense to make one side for small dogs and the other for larger dogs  if there was a scuffle it would nt be a possible death sentence  or if the larger dogs do run a little bit my dog would nt get trampled and possibly break its leg  that is my one major complaint if you are on the passive side why would you bring a ball and thrower and have a pound dog that worries me a little and does nt really suggest a passive dog one bad jump or one bite and my dog is dead or seriously injured also why are the people so rude and unwelcoming  i felt like i was in grade school getting picked last for kickball no i am not from scottsdale i did nt bring poopsie or a gigantic shiz wagon that drags me along by it s leash i m the new girl oooooh i literally had one lady come up to me stare then say are those dogs with you  i say yes she stares some more and then walks away  i just stood there feeling like an ahole if i seen some girl come walking in with cute little dogs i would at least come up and be friendly yes it s large and somewhat clean especially considering the sheer numbers of dogs there lrb some to person rrb if you like crowds then this is for you i m just not into being treated like a leper being around dogs and snotty people that do nt pay attention and use it as their social hour the only thing this place is missing is a martini bar
place is closed with a for rent sign in the window
nasty
seriously this is possibly the worst breakfast burrito i have ever had i ordered a breakfast burrito to go and when i asked for extra hot sauce i got a huge attitude but that aside i was excited to try it out it looked like it would be pretty authentic i came in and cut it in half only to discover mashed potatoes drenched in butter the egg did nt look like egg and the salsa was horrible maybe that s not there specialty but i m not going to go back i had to toss my burrito
why am i the first to review this place  it s been on the map for as long as i can remember and it s been the same icky weird staff and just okay japanese food for just as long in any case it makes a compelling case as as nicer than average restaurant it s a large building and has all the hallmarks of a great japanese eatery sushi bar live seafood you can choose yourself and management that hires native japanese to serve you all signs point to greatness somewhere between the greatness road sign and the arrival at actual greatness someone seems to have taken mr potential and kicked his teeth in before repeatedly punching his groin and laughing as he robbed him of his money let me explain i have give this place repeated chances to show me that it s worth the real estate it s planted on and repeatedly i have felt like mr potential must have felt after his beating i ve been there with groups alone on dates and each time it s either inattentive or rude wait staff and middling food that is nt anywhere near the price of admission the last lrb and final rrb time i went to ichi ban lrb ironically meaning number in japanese ha rrb i took my girlfriend of a year as a treat for both of us why did i go here  you ask a good question and i have no acceptable answer other than i may have subconsiously wanted to break it off with sandie lrb i now have nicknamed her the sand demon  say it out loud it makes sense seriously sand demon sandie but i digress rrb and this was a perfect way to do it the food was once again quite bad and to add insult to injury after delivering our food our waiter began his assault upon finding out i speak fluent japanese he switched entirely over to speaking japanese leaving me to translate everything into english for the sand demon as if that were nt bad enough he began asking me if she was a dirty girl because she sure looked like one to him i could nt believe what he was asking me and definitely was nt going to translate it for sand demon but just in case i misunderstood him i asked him to explain what he meant he went on about how she had a nice rack and long legs and that she just looks like a good time in the sack some people might view this as a compliment in some way but i usually do nt have kind words for a guy who tells me my girlfriend looks whorish and a good lay i told him in my most polite japanese that he d never get the chance to find out since he most likely could nt get laid in a brothel and we left at the time it was nt funny but it s pretty funny now sure he was being rude but in retrospect she was kind of a whore but there s no review area for ex s by the name of sand demon so that s all i ll say about that for now
waited minutes for a burrito with no lines and four people working they forgot my order avoid this place at all cost if you want quality service
i have entered the th level of hell and it is zuma grill let me set the mood it s friday night i am out with some gym buddies we do nt hang out often one is like me low key chill prefers places like casey moore s the other likes the clubs as we hang at casey moore s a debate begins of what we should do next club dude wants to walk down mill and hit up some of the more club like places with dance music girls scantly clad etc etc my other friend and i decide after a few hours of whining that we should just head out and let our club dude do his thang we reluctantly leave casey s as i as good bye to my regular buddies and head down mill after trying a few places lrb library sky bar or something rrb we settle on zuma i immedately feel akward here and realize how lame mill ave is between rula bula and casey s i felt like i had waked into the movie idiocracy as i witness disturbing behavior and conversations about absolutely nothing coming from the art diverse and somewhat intelligent low key crowd of casey s into this was quite the decline into oblivion we ordered drinks and drank drank drank it was getting late so club dude hit the pseudo dance floor that developed in the middle of the bar and my laid back friend and i went out to the front patio so he could smoke we continued our conversation about stanley kubrick while club dude did his thang it was cool compromising something i have learned to do better as i mature we all were able to be in our own environments for a period sometimes when you go out with new people you do nt know what you are going to get but in this case we ended up having a decent time i do nt recommend zuma for much high priced drinks really annoying atmosphere and drunk people just falling out of the place like lemmings on vodka however if that is your thing than go for it do nt say i did nt warn you classy moment of the evening walking by a table with plastic fake glass buckets of ice bottles of moet s imitation champagne turned upside down now if that does nt say enough i am not sure what will about zuma
terribly douchy waiter food is mediocre at best
this is the worst place to take your animal they had us wait for hours and never did any thing for my dog they said they were busy with a dieing cat after hours all they did was come in and ask if we wanted blood work and tests for my dog was having seizures and the seizures had stopped so we left and took him to my regular vet the next day they charged us for doing nothing but let us sitting for hours waiting for them to serve us i do not think we should have had to pay because they did nothing be careful they are very unprofesssional
 first and foremost only the good reviews are posted on biddulph mazda s website  i posted this same review on their site and it never went live  less than a year and a half ago lrb jan rrb i purchased a certified preowned vehicle from biddulph mazda i felt good about purchasing a car that had been through the claimed point inspection my salesman bill was very personable  i have to give him that he did pull the whole the guy who put the price on this car made a mistake it should not be this low but we have to honor it lucky you yeah right i made them print out the car fax and all of that lrb which i still have the exact copy they gave me rrb everything looked reasonable and good the car had pin stripes on it that i did nt like so bill said i could take the car to a place in tucson and have the pin stripes removed and then send biddulph the bill so the next day i took the car to a place in tucson to have them removed and the mechanic said i ca nt remove those because the car has been painted i see paint on top of the stripes so if i pull those off i have no idea what it s going to look like underneath then we proceeded to remove the bra that had been on the car when i purchased it the day before just to find out that the paint was completely damaged underneath i called biddulph and was upset they told me not to worry and that bras can damage the paint and they will fix it so i drove the car back and they lent me a car while it was being fixed when i went back to pick it up stephen who dealt with all of my financing paperwork told me that they could nt give me the same interest rate because my car was a mazda rx and the rate could nt be honored with that model car he then said but do nt worry if we extend your finance tearm to longer than months you re payments will actually be less  steve i m insulted i told him that i absolutely wanted the monthly payment that i had established when i first signed the paperwork and i wanted my month term and he had to work his number magic to get my that monthly payment back and i was not going to take the car unless i got that so steve apparently worked his magic at this point i am exhausted with the entire car purchasing process at biddulph mazda now to get to the main issue just recently i was involved in a minor accident that made me take my car into a shop to be fixed through my insurance the guys at the shop call me and tell me that it is very apparent my car had been in a major accident they said there is bondo all over the car it is apparent that the whole roof of the car the side of the car and the front of the car had been repainted they also said that my bumber did nt even have the shock absorber my vehicle was missing an entire part i went to the shop and took photos of all of their claims it is very clear to me that had my car gone through the claimed point inspection  reasons to relax  the mechanic at the dealership would have noticed these very obvious issues and should nt they have noticed that the paint under the bra was damaged as well  anyway i called biddulph the very next day and left a message for bill and never heard back then i called back later the same day and asked to speak to the sales manager after explaining everything to him there was quite a moment of silence and he said that he would be more than happy for me to come trade the car in great however in august i moved to houston so i could not bring the car back to the phoenix area out of the question he then pulled up my paperwork and said that he does nt see the car was sold as a certified preowned vehicle what thank god i kept all of my paperwork i have a letter from ron stettner the vice president of north american operations that begins dear megan thank you for purchasing a mazda certified preowned vehicle from biddulph mazda we re confident that your certified preowned mazda will bring you satisfaction and peace of mind on the road ahead included with a card that has my vehicles vin number and everything another moment of silence from the sales manager it was friday and i told him that he had monday to come up with a solution it s now tuesday and i have nt heard back bottom line is i paid money for a car that is not the same car i purchased i believe the dealership is adverstising and misrepresenting cars as certified preowned please be wary of doing your business there and anywhere for that matter always hold on to every piece of paper you get from the dealership while you re there shopping and after the fact i am not keeping quiet about this and i am not doing business with biddulph mazda ever again
ordered two pizzas for our office one full pizza with sausage peppers onions pepperoni and olives and the other was a medium veggie pizza the food not that great  it tasted like the pizza had been sitting in the car for a while the sauce tasted bland and the crust was not crispy at all i felt like the pizza was frozen and reheated up again also it seemed like the vegetables were overcooked i do not recommend this place to anyone
last weekend i decided to go on a hunt to see if i could find a deal worthy of trading in my current car for a newer model i went to two dealerships because one i was familiar with and closer to my home and the other had the exact car i wanted i should have never made that second trip i already put car salesman at a lower bar than other people in my mind but this was a whole new level of low if you do nt want to end your day wanting to staple things to people s heads i would stay away from this dealership i walked into the dealership knowing what i wanted i still wanted to browse first but i had researched this is also not my first car buying experience and not my first mazda i am well aware of the line oh yeah and i m also a car fanatic i did nt mind being hunted down by a salesman right away because i had really already knew what i wanted it was coincidental that without saying what i wanted the first car he decided to show me was the one i had seen in their online inventory soon enough i was on a test drive great car as expected i asked some simple questions such as if i could have more details on the specifics of the particular perimeter alarm that was installed on that car to which the salesman did not have an answer makes me think it would have been fun to ask him what was under the hood we all know that what comes next is the fun part and by fun i mean extremely annoying process that takes times longer than it should  the negotiating process the first part was estimating the trade in value of my car though he decided to wrap this up in the first round of pricing negotiations right off the bat i was undercut by a couple grand at least on my trade in not cool i told him that the trade in value was nt acceptable and asked if i could find out the specific price plan i was eligible for to which i received a blank look i would expect a dealership employee to know the various standard pricing plans i also let him know i wanted to know what other offers were available after waiting awhile he came back with no change in the trade in but did give me the pricing plan i was eligible for since it was still not where it needed to be i explained to him what i was looking for i told him my situation and that i did not need to buy a new car i told him that my car was perfectly fine and in amazing condition and that i was nt desperate i let him know the price i had gotten down to at another dealership and where i ideally wanted to be i said i did nt want to play negotiation games and i wanted to know how close he could get me things quickly got out of line i was treated with great disrespect as i was given excuse after excuse and attack after attack at one point he recommended i lease and when i explained to him i did not want to lease i was given a rant of how i do nt put enough miles on my car and it s stupid for me to buy really  okay i m out then if that was nt enough i was also attacked for asking what the lowest price was i was asked if i wanted the company to lose money all while he kept informing me that he gets paid on commission which goes by the number of cars he sells i guess maybe i looked like i did nt know how car dealerships worked and how the car buying process goes at one point he asked again where i wanted to be payment wise to which i told him he then put a range down on a scrap piece of paper with an x and a line below it and told me to sign when i said i was nt comfortable signing a scrap piece of paper below a payment price range without any detail or further information he became very agitated in the end i let him know that this was nt going anywhere and that i did nt think the price was going to be where i needed it to be i told him that with the economy the way it is that i figured the price would be lower when i purchased my other car in a much better economy i was able to get a better deal i asked if i could have my pricing plan certificate back and was given a very sarcastic you can have whatever you want i was so repulsed by the way i was treated i emailed customer service at the dealership and never received a response i can not believe they would ignore a situation like this though with the only other review being a i am not that surprised anymore slightly more detail is available on my blog but i did nt want to write a novel here unless it was wanted oops i guess i already did rrb
wow this was the worst eyebrow wax i have ever had i read the other two reviews and i wonder if i even went to the same place i did nt have enough time to run to my usual waxer somewhere else so i decided to run in here and get it done i should have ran away when i saw the eyebrows of the lady that was waxing me i specifically told her that i just wanted a cleanup and i did not want them thinned well i guess she did nt understand or did nt care because she took almost all my eyebrows and even loopsided one of them she also proceeded to burn me not clean me up and leave wax on my eyebrows so that i had to rub oil all over when i got home to get off please beware when going here for an eyebrow waxing
gold needle alteration is the worst and i strongly suggest you go elsewhere they grossly overcharged and the work looked as if a th grader did it they put one big dart in my jeans they ruined worth of jeans and wanted to charge me to do so please for your own good go elsewhere
went here for a quick bite with family before a play at phoenix theater i was hesitant based on the reviews here about cleanliness and mediocre food but the place is a local legend and we had to give it a try on the way to our booth we passed a large empty table that still had the messy remains of previous diners and wondered why the notbusyatall waitstaff had nt cleaned it up yet the food was on the high side of just ok the malt icecream soda and phosphates we ordered with dinner were fantastic but before the final curtain of the show the cramping began for what would be a hour bout of food poisoning traced back  by process of elimination  to mcalpines chicken salad i suppose if you want a delicious soda fountain treat this is your place if you want to eat diner food without getting sick go somewhere else
it s located in an old house on th st in the coronado area patio is awesome and has a slight europeanspanish feel to it the food in the deli looked appetizing and gourmet i ordered the prosciutto sandwich and my wife had the sirloin the bread was quite good and appeared to be made on location the prosciutto was decent however the sirloin came out bloody at first which the owner admitted before even placing on our table it is supposed to be medium per his admission so we were confused why he even brought it out when my wife asked him about this he leered at her and said he knew what medium meant and then took it back to the kitchen before this he talked to her rudely when she was looking for the restroom the restrooms are labeled in italian which my wife speaks along with french spanish and english she paused in front of the door to adjust her purse and the aforementioned owner told her that s right it means ladies room in italian in a tone you would take with a child after the sirloin issue my wife and i just stared at each other in disbelief at the audacity of this fat bad mannered self righteous man when the sirloin came back out it was cooked properly but lacked flavor the bread was the only thing worth eating on the plate the server who took our order was this prissy guy who lacked not only personality but any sense of being helpful i do nt know if the owner is trying to create this new yorkeuropean poor service because we can atmosphere but please that does nt fly here and anyone that thinks this is acceptable must have very low self esteem you ca nt talk to customers like that i do nt care how good your food may be and in this case it was mediocre and to clarify i hate chain restaurants always try to support local business and know good food and service when i experience it so it s not that i do nt get it i will never return to this restaurant and implore you not to go here either oh and if you are the owner rest assured i will be scathing your restaurant on other review websites along with telling every single person i know how rude you are and how mediocre your cooking is i promise you will make less money because of your behavior towards my wife
my wife and i went to stingray with high hopes based on a previous visit to another location this experience was a large disappointment we arrived at on a thursday evening and we were able to get a seat right away we found out we were there during happy hour so we ordered drinks and appetizers the drinks were good and unique and the crunchy spicy tuna appetizer was also good but that was where it ended the other appetizer was a shrimp tempura roll which was average at best then came the main course my wife ordered the spicy shrimp roll which was also average with more rice than fish and the lava roll which was awful with the fish glob on top being all mushy as if it had been prechewed and spit on top of the roll i ordered the seared big eye tuna the risotto it came with was outstanding the tuna was in a word awful the flavor was good but this was the first piece of fish i have ever had that could nt be eaten because of sinews running through it i had to cut away over  of the meat because it could nt be cut or chewed to top it off the service was poor at best the staff was friendly but our water ran out numerous times our server was hard to find and the coup de gras was that they completely forgot my order my wife had completely finished both plates of her sushi lrb well she did nt eat the lava rolls because they were awful rrb and my tuna still had nt arrived when our server finally walked by after minutes lrb not exaggerating we watched the time rrb and asked she went to the kitchen and came back explaining the kitchen was backed up considering i ordered a dish that required all of minutes to cook i was nt buying it the manager walked by and i said something to him he went in the kitchen and came back about minutes later with my dinner both the manager and server apologized  but that was it not so much as a coupon for discount next time or my entre being comped nothing i understand restaurants make mistakes but own up to it and do something about it not that i spend a lot of time in scottsdale but i can assure you we will not be going back
ok so i think that this may be the first business that gets one star from me i just flew home from israel on this airlines boy they are pretty sad i usually do nt like to be too harsh on anyone but this airlines deserves it please do nt think of this review as complaining but rather a warning to others out there to never fly us airways lrb nobody likes a complainer right  haha rrb well not never but if you have no other choice i would venture to guess that this airlines is pretty cheap because of the full flight loads that i encountered you could say that is good for them but the service on the planes was not up to par i guess i have been spoiled with the likes of hawaiian airlines nippon airlines shoot you can even throw delta in there the flight attendants are rude this is from both personal experience and from observation of my own you know what i could go on and on but i really do nt like to cry about stuff would i fly us airways again  no way if it was one of the last airlines on earth  maybe i just hope that their service of customers get better then again maybe they didnt treat me well for the fact that i had nt shaved and looked talibanish oops
i have been going to ticoz for years and loved it but last week i went with friends and the place was empty i wondered why then the waiter came to our table he was rude to my friend right off the bat unbelievable she was nice enough and laughed it off it left a bad taste in my mouth the prices have risen and the food quality had declined i ordered the nachos for us and they were horrific the peach salad was still good though ticoz seriously right now  lower your freakin prices quit charging for salsa and chips hire nicer staff or your days are numbered just sayin 
we went to brio for our year anniversary and were very disappointed it was our first time ever at brio and we ve heard good things so we thought we d try it our server was great but the food not so much we do nt mind spending extra money on good food but we ended up spending extra money on mediocre bland food my boy friend got raviolis which were dollars and came with bite sized raviolis my pasta was bland and i ended up adding extra pepper to it just so it could have some flavor we ended up spending over on bad food needless to say we wo nt be going to brio ever again
the lines are always long they only have or ppl working and all of the women are rude i ve waited in line for over an hour and a half some days i wish i did nt prepay for my po box here service is awful
first tried mimi s when we first started coming to scottsdale about years ago it was always a go to place where we could get good food at a decent price do nt know what s happened but we ve been to different locations this trip and the food has really gone downhill sauces are gummy and cooked to death with too much flourcornstarch had the crab cake appetizers most recently and neither crab or cake belong in the description the crab was nonexistent and they were the size of a inch pancake the other annoying thing is that the servers now try to push whatever special is going in like the wine thing or the add a soup or salad thing so sorry we wo nt be going to any mimi s anytime soon
dont bother the majority of women who work here are very rude i have spent thousands of dollars here in the last years and when trying to us a free coupon here that wouldnt scan i was accused of already using the coupon and trying to double use are you kidding me if you dont want to offer the savings babies r us then dont not the first time myself sister or mother was treated poorly here sad but true this store needs new management to come in and do some housecleaning with the staff at this point i will not shop here and will pay more elsewhere just to avoid this place you have seen my last dollar babies r us
lousy excuse for a restaurant do nt waste your time or money on this place my fajita s were cold my margarita tasted like koolaid my salad came after the meal i would have complained if there was anyone in sight the server was an idiot who actually said i do nt know and then stared at me after i asked a question about a dish disgusting
i was told if if i bought a strip of classes that i could use for other things like massage etc when i called for massage appointment they said they do nt offer this anymore they would not give a return on my money i live to far away to use for yoga so they mislead into signing up and now have stolen my money

i used to come here on occasion and always had a blast  however this time around has put me off forever went to eat with friends  waitress i found to be rude as she acknowledge my guy friends and barely made contact with me throughout the night sat in my chair did not look at me nor apologize when i came back to find her sitting there beside my significant other odd since i found her demeanor to be lacking and found her to be rude and short i tipped her   which she in turn told me that was shitty and proceeded then to call me a bitch several times i kept my composure while she continued to have issues with her anger and i asked to speak to the manager i knew from her tone that the manager would not be helpful at all and i was correct he was insincere and unhelpful the waitress should be reprimanded or sent to anger management as this is the first time i ever had such an experience especially being called names talk about immature
i have been back to this honey bear s location several times since my first review and the place has gotten significantly worse on each subsequent visit this last visit will definitely be my last the place does not look well maintained at all and the food was an utter disappointment i ordered my usual hot link sandwich and my other half ordered a pulled pork sandwich my hot link sandwich was so so sad and the pulled pork sandwich was not only smaller and on different bread but also lacking taste or flavor and add to that it not tasty of course it gave him heartburn later to his dismay now i need to find myself another place to sate my hot link cravings
ordered a front door from arcadia several months ago was told once ordered it would be two weeks to have the exterior painted and ready for delivery  well weeks turned into and they never gave me the courtesy to give updates on my order  i was the one calling to check the status when the day did come for install they dropped the door off with an install guy lrb he actually told me flat out that the company is poorly organized and he apologized for my experience rrb turns out they sent the wrong door and wrong size frame the installer had to wait for the truck to come pick him up and short story short the install lrb which should ve taken max hours rrb ended up taking they made an absolute mess they didnt even have the courtesy of grouting where they screwed up trying to make the frame fit to top it off the paint they used is already beginning to fade in certain areas i would steer clear of arcadia window and door

i hate you ikea yep i said it i have given it a few tries and every single time is makes me even more angry first of all navigating this beast makes me want to take a pen to my eye and sneak shots in my purse secondly they ca nt get anything correct we came three times for one light fixture that was broken or did nt work when hooked up each time we bought bucks worth of cabinets and the handwritten ticket by the staff pick up downstairs method got us different colors and models for the same kitchen after the second trip for this screw up we requested a manager who simply said remodeling sure can be tough yeah especially when ikea ca nt match a model number boo million times over between the commute traffic and complete crap of customer service you can mark my words we will never return
this place sucks they always set there line up in the middle of the sidewalk and i kick down there little barricade things every time i m drunk leaving rulabula the music sucks and so do the people it s like a old town club that is misplaced do nt go there unless you like having a bad time
joe s crap shack is a more accurate name for this overpriced tasteless restaurant i m not sure what we were thinking when we decided to eat lunch here yesterday one of my dining companions was lured by the word crab and a stomach twisting hunger so we stopped in everything on the menu sounded good in theory but it did nt pan out so well in practice for i expected the crab cake sandwich to be almost a work of art  succulent crab perfectly spiced and neatly fried instead the sandwich was a lukewarm lump devoid of flavor unless you count the lingering aftertaste of old fish the remoulade sauce served with the sandwich was tasty with fries but it did nothing to save the sandwich from the pits of nastiness the crunchy fish sandwich is usually served with cheese i asked for mine without but regretted it immediately the fish fillets were the blandest i have ever had and the cheese probably provides the only flavor this sandwich has honestly i ve had better fish fillets from the frozen section of the grocery store another thing to dislike about the crunchy fish sandwich is the fact that they did nt serve tartar sauce or any other condiment with it who has a dry fish sandwich  blech the blackened tuna sandwich looked promising when it arrived at the table with inch thick slab of tuna steak sitting atop the bun one bite shattered that notion the fish was dry and overcooked while the blackening spice seemed to be more likely ground up charcoal no taste the one redeeming aspect to our lunch was the crab dip that was really tasty but i doubt if i d return for just that skip joe s crap shack if you re in the mood for ocean critters i wish we had i felt dirty and cheap after paying our lunch bill and walked out of the place very unsatisfied and a little pissed
i believe your awards were before the fire and under different owners frozen chicken fried steak is not an award winner is it frozen or fresh  why just not make the signature dish fresh  i would be back for that
i am not impressed with the mondrian at all i have stayed here or times and each time left with a irritated feeling and an empty pocketbook the rooms are upwards of bucks a night for that you would expect them to be decent when you first glance in at the black and white interior you find it modern and sleek pretty swanky upon further investigation you realize it is all a scam they must have went to design on a dime for ideas then left because they could nt afford it the remodeling from the james consists of sheets tacked to the walls and dangly things hot glued to the undersides of the counters the bathrooms are a joke and i have almost broken the sliding doors lrb twice sober rrb also the tv s are too big for the rooms so they must be watched at an odd angle the skybar over looks the parking lot how tacky lrb and hot rrb is that the pool is a pretentious joke you should be a beauty queen or at least have an expensive rack the cabanas can be rented for a day for that you get a tv misters and a couch i have actually been here on a few occasions because friends have dj d and my friend is the bar manager lrb it always helps to choke down free drinks rrb but if i was paying last time my friend ordered a pitcher of sangria we knew it would be expensive but they use little penguin wine that you can pick up for bucks i was nt even able to get drunk enough to enjoy the underwater speakers ostentatious jerks
lost my tire center cap broke my radiator hose nice work otherwise
let me start by saying that i love playing golf and i have probably played nearly different tracks in az i love playing at dobson ranch it is a great course for the money it does nt get much better the reason why i am giving them one star is pure and simple because of customer service the guys that work in the pro shop are ridiculously rude every time no exceptions i called to try and set up a tournament for my work with over players the total cost was going to exceed that included the round range balls lunch and a gift card of some sort plus the ridiculous cart fee it did nt matter if we did nt want lunch or the gift card it was non negotiable this was more expensive that courses such as legacy the raven and the foothills for someone who works in the customer service industry there is nothing more important that treating customers the right way and dobson ranch failed miserably in my book
great atmosphere awful food everyone looked like they were working hard to make everyone happy except maybe the cooks the food was gross good ranch dressing and fries though thank goodness
do i have to give this place a star to post a review  maybe rounds up to in yelp math  flat out the place smells like ass and not in a good way there s this sour smell not quite dumpster juice but in the same ballpark maybe the bar was built on an indian sewage plant  the wings were ok but unless somebody else was driving and i was incredibly drunk i ca nt see myself ever going there again
do yourself a favor and skip this hellhole if you insist on going then make sure you wear proper shoes they let customers throw peanut shells on the floor and it reeked like an old moldy cellar
erik t got it right httpwwwyelpcombizchinobandidophoenixhridfcdsmscmogpuwvkmosg i wo nt repeat his comments but he is spot on my partner and i set out for a friday evening meal and i let him choose a few weeks back he saw chino bandido featured on diners driveins and dives well chino is definitely a dive but he really wanted to try it what a mistake the best thing about chino bandido is the friendly service after that it is all down hill the place is downright filthy the food is nt very good and the atmosphere is sorely lacking of the two of us my partner is a very forgiving easygoing guy i on the other hand am at the other end of the spectrum and am very picky for him to make the following comments tells me this place really is very bad rrb this place is really dirty rrb the food is awful rrb i wo nt be coming back rrb hurry up and eat i want to get out of here to sum it all up if you want to eat bad food in a filthy dirty restaurant and wait forever for your food lrb it took ours over minutes rrb at least you ll get friendly service do nt say i did nt warn you read erik t s review
we have purchased yogurt from golden spoon on shea in scottsdale for several years the yogurt is good either we did nt notice or the place has become filthy quickly it is disgusting the place is filthy we have seen bugs lrb i wo nt tell you what variety but one can guess rrb the door windows mirrors and display case glass seems to have the same dirt each visit the franchise owner kyle obviously does nt care we will not return
this place was recommended to me so i decided to try it out big mistake i tried their jampong soup and it was the worst jampong and worst soup i have ever had the noodles were nt fresh infact they tasted like they had been frozen for yrs too long extremely mushy and not edible the soup was bland and was not proper jampong soup i think they mixed a couple sauces together with water and called it jampong the seafood and beef were dismal and the shrimp that was in the soup was nt cleaned properly please do us all a favor and take this so called jampong soup off your menu
unfortunately since this fab store is closing they could care less about their customers they will tell you that you can return something even though they will be closing soon and they wo nt honor this policy i bought several door knobs for my remodel and ended up with too many lrb baldwin knobs rrb and they would nt take them back even though they specifically told me they would
do i even have to say anything  worst airline ever first and last time i am allowing myself to travel on this airline long layovers delays missed flights due to delays worst experience ever we were flying all the way from pr and our first stop was philadelphia the plane we were suppose to board was late coming in from amsterdam finally after hours we boarded and got to phoenix late which caused us to miss our connecting flight to san jose and the worst part was the flight they directed us all to use to get to sj was full and they had one seat left and they just handed it off to whoever ran through the door honestly it was the worst thing ever if i could give this a i would btw the planes are horrible they charge so much for food which they run out of fast the only thing you can get is a free soda so i highly recommend to bring your own food pillows and blankets if you have a long flight prepare for the worst the seats are narrow and uncomfortable and i m not even that tall
i wanted to transfer two of my dog s rxs from another store to cvs for the promotion they offered with these transfers the pharmacy assistant refused to honor it at the pharmacy because i did nt bring the coupon i asked the manager if they would honor the gift card without the coupon and he said sure tell the pharmacist i said it was fine i did then the pharmacist stalked over and chewed out the manager and came back and said he should nt have told you that customer service rule  violated do nt argue in front of customers  do nt be rude to customers my other prescriptions will remain at walgreens
what are you in the mood for  i truly suggest this place if you re looking for grade d salad and such and if you want to leave in a clinically depressed state of mind pros all you can eat cons why in the world would you want more than a bite  every different lettuce bowl contained gross amounts of browning greens while the spinach looked and tasted fresh the romaine was not the parmesan was the kind that resembles anthrax or cocaine the dressing was ubersalty and quite disgusting the bacon bits contained no trace of pig and there was no protein other than cubed ham to be found while i can see how the entire soupsaladpasta  fruitpizzaice creamtacos  package might be worth and change this was a horrible buy for a person looking for a salad with some ample protein when your name contains the word salad do nt you think you should offer some good greens 
i didnt feel too good for days after grabbing the tacquito s for lunch too greasy so i prob wont go back
less than stellar food absolute crap service at a time when there was only one other party there my girlfriend left hungry because she could nt stomach the poorly cooked tofu
overpriced subs bread and meat has changed to lowgrade same quality as subway just a higher price tag will not visit again
the only reason i will be going here is that it s the closest gym to my house after my free hour personal training session that came with joining it will take all my energy to walk back into that place i ve never seen such high pressure sales tactics the dude trying to sell me their outrageously expensive personal training packages just would nt take no for an anwer when i said i needed to ask my husband about the extra money he said i m disappointed that your husband does nt support you and you have to ask him about that kind of thing what an ahole i walked out at that point lrb before i ripped his face off rrb
this is some place you only want to go to if you have to the atmosphere sucks the food always seems bland the building feels like it s in disrepair and the staff are lifers and kids passing through there are few places which can make you feel even worse about grabbing fast food and unfortunately this is one of them the bk on broadway near hardy is a million times better
when i first moved to phoenix i unknowingly wandered into this place i love a good bargain who does nt but this place gives new meaning to the term dumpster diver or perhaps it s where the term originated i felt dirty just being in this place if you ve ever seen the cartoon of tom and jerry when tom is fishing and reels in a dirty old rotten boot same concept applies to this store i would nt recommend it
we went here on a night where they closed off part of the street to have a party and the best part was there was actually a group of guys who paid for a table and another group of people who i am convinced were there just to take pictures of themselves for facebook this place is very very very very lame
we usually try to find some different places while we are on vacation we where not sure what to expect i had a feeling we shouldnt come here because all the good reviews where for breakfast but who can screw up a breakfast menu  i ordered the ribs with tritip and mac n cheese as a side the mac n cheese wasnt even close to being good i give that a i found out later that night that my cousin didnt like it either on there menu it says the ribs are the most ordered thing the first rib was a but then all the meat disappered because there wasnt much to of the ribs where broke also not something you want to see while eating the tritip was ok also the parts you could eat anyways the garlic bread isnt garlic bread that i give a also my grandma ordered spaghetti and meat balls and she had to use my steak knife to cut one of her meatballs lol never coming back
dont waste your money here the food is disgusting  the place is not clean health code violations galore i got extremely sick here the manager whatever his name is a jerk
qq grill closed it s doors two months ago
this place is overrated my taco shell was so greasy i ordered a taco salad with shredded beef and got big giant hunks of beef one time was enough for me wo nt be back
we got the rope vieja and cuban sandwich everything was super bland the rice was not cooked through either we were excited to find a cuban restaurant but this place was very disappointing
their sales people lie the trainers are sales people and high pressure you to buy a training package meaning they will text you and call relentlessly the pool was out of service for the first month of my membership showers always have hair in them there s rust on the bathroom vents and the yoga classes are next to a racquetball court nuff said here s the deal their website claims a bbb a  rating yet it shows over complaints in the past three years as of today i was complaint  
on  i took my computer in to softque because my computer would nt allow me to open anything on the desktop all i could do was turn on my computer clearly a virus i also could nt uninstall openoffice i gave my box to chelsie the next day they called and said they could find no virus and that everything opened up just fine for them they could nt explain why i could nt open anything i asked them to uninstall openoffice so they did and i was charged for this i brought it home and tried it everything did open up for me however my internet was super slow and it would nt let me click on certain hyperlinks that open new windows so i still had a virus a few days later my computer just went blank and nothing worked again this time i took it to red sevens who charges less to fix viruses anyway the only reason i took it to softque in the first place is because red sevens had moved miles further but apparently the longer trip is warranted
called last night  and tried to do call ahead seating for for a party of we are in town and are here to see some friends explained to hostess that some in the group are seniors so would need to have assurance on reservation i was told to call back in an hour the thought process by her was that it was too soon to give me a time and they were nt that busy yet so i did as told and called back and after about minutes of confusion and other waiting i was told we could nt be seated until or we could have seperate booths i explained that we needed to sit together and hours was the best she could do i was so frustrated i told her no thanks that we would find other arrangements she said ok and that was it nice job texas roadhouse not there is no excuse for not having a reservation system in place like open table one day there will be no customers to disappoint then maybe you will get it
overrated pizza is mediocre sauce lacks taste very expensive
dinner with my family started out enjoyable enough the food was rather mediocre though i was nt expecting much being far from any sources of fresh fish or japanese cooks i also decided to steer clear of the blue wasabi that looks like it s been dipped in antifreeze it was obvious their focus was not on food but on drinks and creating a fun atmosphere their decor is hip and contemporary with a color changing wall above the bar and abundant flashing lights and tv screens they try to continue the theme by naming their signature sushi rolls with silly names like eating nemo or kiss my bass though a few like me soy horny roll or dirty sanchez hardly make you think of sushi despite the second rate food and the epilepsy inducing environment hanging out with your yr old nephew is always a good time or so i thought close to the resolution of dinner i took a break to smoke a joint behind the restaurant i m from cali so i was being a bit nonchalant and careless about it all not realizing the laws here are a bit different i was just chatting on the phone with my girlfriend while trying to mind my own business a girl from blue wasabi who was also hanging out in back of the restaurant smelled it and asked me to please move on i replied sorry i did nt realize i was disturbing anyone thanks for telling me nicely and i put it out and returned to my table minutes later the cops are hauling me out in front of my parents and little nephew minutes later i m in cuffs and they re charging me with a class felony wow i couldnt believe it this girl even described me as nice to the cops yet she called the cops on me as i peacefully patronize her restaurant with my family does she have no heart  what a cruel and unnecessary thing to do things like this make me lose faith in humanity why would someone wish such terrible treatment upon a fellow human for no good reason  it makes me deeply sad i ca nt in good faith recommend a restaurant where they treat their customers like criminals literally
warning ripped off lrb read the review below then my edit at the end rrb the first time i went to bs west i had a blast i m a straight person but i loved a club that expressed an open mind and individuality so i invited friends to join me the next time i went i ve only been there saturday nights when the club has a cover and for drinks those are smoking deals and i ve never had a problem til tonight the bartenders tend to be the same in each area i find the ones upstairs to be a lot more friendly i had gotten my drinks and tokens up stairs but getting a drink downstairs was another issue this review is for those who plan on getting drinks at the club i asked for a long island lrb comes in a regular plastic cup rrb the bartender downstairs asked if i wanted to leave a tab open or just pay for the drink i decided on the latter he passed me the bill it was for drink lrb on a  night rrb wtf i had a feeling they tend to take advantage of the patrons later on seeing as most are probably to drunk to realize what they just paid for i m one of those people who just do nt argue it lrb karma is a well you know rrb and in turn i will just never return lrb or at least drink at another bar before coming here rrb this is really disappointing lrb i wo nt advise anyone from not going here everyone but the bartenders downstairs have been so friendly and not trying to rip you off but if i had to give any advice pregame before it s not worth it  so later i realized that not only was it saturday s  night lrb that apparently you pay for drink for rrb but it s also a cover to get in i paid for two of my friends to get in also lrb total rrb i handed the big lady at entrance a bill lrb she s been there taking the cash both times i ve went so it s not like she s new to this rrb she in turn hands me in change lrb it should have been even if she thought i handed her a bill it was obvious she knew she was ripping me off unfortunately i did nt realize it until later rrb this is a warning for those who have nt been there before they will take your money if you re not careful i guess just thinking this place was full of awesome people and trusting them to be welcoming is not enough i will be writing a letter to them even though nothing can be done it s just extremely disappointing lrb
this is the worst starbucks of all time drinks are always bad  or completely wrong slow service disgusting bathrooms annoying baristas i only go here if i m desperate for caffeine in a rush and do nt have time to walk to royal
so i sit down at the bar i have a couple of drinks a new bartendress starts the girl next to me orders another drink and the bartendress asks her how many she s already had lrb and i thought that was odd because she was showing no signs of drunkenness but i thought maybe she knew her rrb i start talking to this guy at the bar who was talking kinda loud and she admonishes him lrb saying i keep hearing you and thinking there s gonna be a fight which was so not the case lrb he was just being animated and talking to three people all at once while sitting at the bar i ask for another beer and she goes well okay but i think this should be your last now i ve been a licensed bartender lrb in wisconsin rrb and told not to over serve your customers but this was just crazy in my humble opinion i was not slurring my speech nor was i loud or obnoxious no biggie but it was pm and i had not been there all that long nor had i drank too much lrb i had four drinks in two hours rrb so if your ever into tying one on lrb which i was not at the time rrb this is definitely not the place to go also i did not find the people here extraordinary and the jukebox either lrb typical johnny cash classics punk and new wave standards better than most sports bars but nothing out of the ordinarily for a bar catering to hipsters rrb and the bartender had her cleavage covered completely with ink lrb tattoos rrb which imho is a violation of hallowed ground and of course she just had to show the world just gross and boring imho i will not be back but your mileage may vary clearly others think otherwise
i ve now tried this place several times i want to like it and i rarely write bad reviews but ugh the cost versus what you get is so out of whack that i m compelled to write the food is very heavygreasy it s expensive lrb for people rrb for what you get and the preparation is poor at best my friends had the steak and the carne adobada i the rellenos we had the garlic dish which sadly did nt come before the meal but rather with it but even that is that was nt a big deal however sadly all of us pretty much confirmed that the meals had we made them at home we would have tossed and taken the family out people seem to want to compare this place with richardson s due to similar dna unfortunately the place is not anywhere near as good as richardson s was and i ca nt really put a finger on why if you like heavy greasy premium priced food then this place is for you
i used to love shopping at sunflower the produce was great with a nice selection of organic and organic binds the prices were good cashiers were nice what has happened to this store first the produce was old lettuce was old and soggy in the container the onion i bought yesterday sprouted the kale was obviously old and yellow i started returning things something is wrong at this store then i was in over the weekend t only got a few things and went to the bind with organic apricots the bind was half full i took some out and then i noticed insects flying around inside the bind thats it i m done and will take my business elsewhere
four stars for the food another cumulative star for the service making them a solid five that was before we checked out minus five for their not having a defibrillator anywhere on site when my heart began missing beats right after their informing me how two cups of turkey soup one half sandwich a whole sandwich two iced teas a cookie and a small slice of bread pudding came to fortyseven bucks i must have appeared to the cashier as a mouthbreather and to everyone else in line when i stood there frozen vegetatively reverberating  huhfortyseven bucks really how is that even possible  lrb head shake rrb eventually my friend s laugher brought me back but it was my turn to pay for lunch so i could nt tell them to stuff their fortyseven bucks and walk out this place is in the middle of bfe with nowhere else to eat except the desert and i do nt care for cactus or rocks so i sucked it up and did the only thing i could do under the circumstances i sat there eating my lunch fixating on how i d just blasted through one fifth of my unemployment check on a fucking turkey sandwich not going back
i have no idea about the food or service as the restaurant was closed for lunch on the day i had a reservation for a party of they had an accident in the kitchen regarding a fire suppressant system i know accidents happen and they had tried to call me the very nice hostess made a point of coming to the door and took my name and number so that the manager could call me to apologize guess what weeks later  no call where does a party of drop in  it was a huge hassle and no call  do they not know about the longevity of restaurants on market street  better step it up
what is this filth that i am eating  had it delivered but whoops forgot the rice how do you forget the rice  anyhow the peanut sauce was deplorable it was literally the consistency of water i could pour it down the drain  and did the panang curry was the same  more like soup and less like sauce this place is easily in the bottom of thai places i have ever eaten at
i went in to get an ipad case and i got more help and info from other shoppers than i did from the staff and checking out  a pain in the arse no one wanted to take my money finally one associate told me to see any blue shirt in the front of the store bc they have handheld scanners but i couldnt catch any of them it was ridiculous finally a woman i had overheard telling people she was just directing traffic noticed how perplexed i was and rang me up thankfully so as i was about to just give up and hit another apple or just shop online if you are going to play with all the toys and gadgets you ll be fine just be prepared to tackle someone when you re ready to actually buy something
the salon has moved from its original location now it s in a strip mall down a long dark corridor in a tiny cramped room and there is barely room for the stylist a parent and a child the stylist arrived late was rather shockingly unkempt and sat down upon arrival and talked at us for thirty minutes before starting to cut my daughter s hair not sure why i waited but i did nt want to be rude forty five minutes later we had a haircut that did not resemble in the least the cut i d requested and i was just happy to get out of there would nt dream of going back and would never recommmend it to anyone
wow i m really surprised at the reviews for this place the pizzabytheslice was awful somehow a combination of crust  sauce  cheese had little to no flavor my dad and sister even sent back two slices of fresh tomato basil and garlic because they both agreed that it tasted like nothing let me write that again in case you did nt catch it  tomato  basil  garlic  no flavor how  i ordered a piece of the sicilianstyle which is thicker crust  again very little flavor the red pepper flakes i doused both pieces with could nt even save them  i ate about  of both pieces and left the rest our young server was nice and everything but a tablefull of unenthusiastic mehs when she asked how everything was should have raised a red flag instead we paid and quickly exited it s next to the movie theater what did i expect  i would not go back
i love ihop but this one is terrible i finally decided to try pancakes there and asked if they had real maple syrup i was told they did and did nt believe them so argued with waiter he went to the cook to ask and came back saying the hot syrup was real maple so i trust that advice immediately i got a reaction and felt lethargic told manager about it and he did nt seem to care that i had an allergic reaction to the false information provided by the staff other times i love the tossed salad with chicken description says it is tossed with yellow mustard normally at other places it is tossed like it is described at this one however they just give it to you on the side small nitpick i know but if you describe something as tossed in he menu it should be tossed there are several other examples of bad service and food i will not be coming back to this terrible restaurant and i suggest everyone else turn away as well
worst mexican place ever this was the most overpriced crappy food i have ever eaten in the phoenix area when you walk in it looks legit and even smells pretty good due to the wood they use to smoke some of their chicken once i opened the menu i could not believe it i think the cheapest dinner item was over i tried the carnitas a mexican staple and something i usually enjoy not this time in one word bland no seasoning whatsoever no salt no pepper no lime nothing at all to make this meat taste decent it was tender i will give them that but it was more like jello than pork the texture was pretty gross we also had to pay extra to get tortillas with the carnitas who the hell does not serve tortillas with their carnitas  seriously the black beans were okay the only part of the meal i could actually stomach the rice was crunchy and bland the salsa was bland and watery also no refills on the salsa cheap bastards charge me over for bland crap and can not even fill up my salsa for free  the service was bad slow and aloof i would rather eat at one of the bertos instead of this crap hole honestly save yourself the money and find another mexican joint i am in shock that this place has customers not even deserving of one star that bad
wow this place was awful subs were not terrible but not in any way great you walk in and all the employees lrb who could be considered the only special part of this experience rrb scream something at you then a lesbian greets you and teaches you how to read a menu and place an order you wait minutes and one of the tards err i mean employees brings you your food i honestly do nt even remember what i ordered that s how mundane the food is here their famous lemonade tastes like someone put a bunch of wet naps into a bowl of water sipped it realized it was nasty as hell then put lbs of sugar and food coloring into it every time i drive by i visualize the place engulfed in flames fitting 
terribly unprofessional i would never recommend to anyone they made an appointment and then lost the work order and lied about ever making an appointment i find it funny that the one other fantastic review is from a deborah when the main person working there is debbie same person  call someone else and save the aggravation
i have sampled their product at the farmers market and in their store i have also sampled their personality at both locations i think i was served by the owner at the farmers market and her mother at the store the apple does nt fall far from the tree the daughter is definitely worse than the mother though they are both quite rude and very lacking in business and people skills they should perhaps concentrate on wholesale or internet marketing where they do nt have to interact with people because they are quite unpleasant to deal with their prices are crazy too but that s possibly good because this stuff is very good to eat but not good for you however i just do nt see the justification for almost per pound it seems quite ridiculous but since they obviously think their personal waste is perfumed they no doubt believe people should pay a premium to enjoy their product too it might be good but i can definitely live without giving my hard earned cash to this pair of nasty people if others feel the same way they wo nt be in business too long
pierre you ve said everything there is to say about this i ca nt wait to see it bulldozed any day now
horrible i took us airways coming back home from a business trip in which i had to take connecting flights from dca to phx to sfo my flight was supposed to leave at pm from phx and when i go to checkin lrb upon arrival from dca rrb they tell me that my bags from my connecting flight were put on a later flight at pm i even showed them my confirmationreceipt printed out and they told me they could nt do anything because my bags were put on a later flight to sfo to top it all off instead of the nice aisle seat i originally requested on a bigger plane i got stuck boarding a mini one with a seat in siberia next to the lavatory door that would nt close and the attendant had to use a pen to keep it shut during takeoff my seat was soiled and the window cover was cracked and you could nt even pull it down because it was being held up by a crumpled piece of newspaper it was so uncomfortable and dirty i did nt even want to lean back into my seat i almost cried i ve sat on cleaner seats in the bart horrible never again
my wife and i went to applebees last night and it was not good we tried the for promotion we had chicken wings for the appetizer and they were to heavy on the tobasco sauce with no real other flavor my wife had the cajun shrimp and pasta and i had the riblet basket the pasta contain pieces of uncooked pasta and could not be eaten the riblet basket had two tiny slabs of riblets with a very strong flavor of tenderizer i also received french fries on my plate needless to say we will not be back
 do not buy groupons for this business  went in to use mine which became effective after am on  after my car wash began they told me that am on  meant  i explained that i was a contract lawyer for years i know what am on  means they refused to honor the groupon and my car was pulled off the line after the totally lovely and nice lrb it was nt her fault rrb desk woman called headquarters to get permission for me to use it she was a doll but whoever owns this business be advised i am circulating this experience all over yelp and facebook
since we always come here for happy hour i thought to stop by for lunch one day for sushi um yeah there are nt very many sushi specials for lunch the only thing on the menu was pcs sushi with soup for the menu was puzzling  had clam chowder burgers and nonexistent sushi options very disappointing
i went to  coachnwillies last night as part of the  downtownphoenix spring fling pub crawl coach  willies is the reason negative ratings should be possible on  yelp i will never ever return when we arrived we ordered a beer and a soda we also ordered nachos they were piled high this is a good thing removing the first couple chips resulted in a couple olives falling on to the bar i wiped them into a pile but figured i d wait until i was done to catch anything else and clean it up a few of us decided to have a shot to celebrate a birthdayinprogress i flagged one of the bartenders down he approaches me and says are you gonna stop making a mess on my bar  me excuse me  bt you re making a mess me i would like to order a drink not get hassled bt i do nt care about your drinks i only care about your tips me well you re not exactly working for one at the moment bt are you going to order or not  i placed my order without any further comments lest i inform him of my true feelings he takes my credit card and asks if i d like to keep it open i tell him no because i have left my card in the past he returns with the receipt on the tip line i write nofuckingway i work in a service industry you do nt treat me like shit and still get a tip fuck you a while later i go to order a beer this same motherfucker tells me i m cut off yes i am cut off i have had maybe three beers and a shot in hours i ask another bartender and as he is about to pour me a beer the first sob hollers to him that i am cut off then proceeds to show him my receipt because apparently you not giving a tip is justification for him being a cocksucker i demand to see a manager and one comes over i tell him that the guy is cutting me off because i refused to tip him and he tells me that the problem is that there is a minimum on cc transactions curiously that is nt stated anywhere further this manager took my first beer order when i arrived and made no mention of the minimum when i bought just the one beer nor did the other bartender mention that when i paid for the shots which actually totaled this manager was gracious enough to let me pay their establishment for service again  sarcasm i will recommend to every single person i know to never patronize that establishment and i will never return to a place with such puerile and petty employees
was it a bad day or is it crazy i had a groupon certificate for value i had called and asked what they had going on that night they told me an extra large one topping and get a small cheese free i had ordered it and went to pick it up i paid the difference with my certificate and took home a great set of pizzas a few weeks later my girlfriend gave me her certificate for the same place when i called he looked up my number and saw the deal i had before i repeated the order and went to pick it up when i got there i gave the owner the certificate same as lat time and that is when things went wrong he said that i had to pay for the cheese pizza i told him this is the same thing i had ordered a few weeks before with the same deal he again said i owed him more for a small cheese pizza i explained i did not have the extra money and would not have ordered it he said i did order it and owe him i again said that i can not afford that for a small cheese pizza he yanks the pizza from the stack and throws it into the back cooking area smashing into pots and pans making a crashing sound the staff from the back run out to see what is happening i stand amazed and say you did nt have to do that he yells back at me its my pizza i can do what i want with it he is so worked up that he gives me to much change back which i return to him no thanks just rage and anger i was sad and when i contacted corporate in chicago they explained that he is not part of their company the name is the same the food and menu is too so he is on his own and does what he wants so if you are up for a freak show feel free to come in and see the owner act out like a child in a temper tantrum
i went into this midas yesterday for an oil change and had a very bad experience  i came home and wrote to customer service and i guess it goes right to the store not sure what good that does here is my letter and the very unprofessional response i got from dennis robbins my letter to customer service i came in today for an oil change and to have an oil leak checked i have been in before and dealt with guy walker who was always very helpful and nice i came into today and got a very rude reception  not by guy  he was nt there  i told the gentleman i needed an oil change and the reply was hey i ca nt just pull a guy off of a job just to change your oil what first of all it says no where on the coupon that i need an appt lrb never had one before rrb and this guy told me he was basically busy for the next few days and nd of all do nt offer a deal then i was willing to wait to see if he had a noshow but after his bad attitude i told him i would take my biz elsewhere i have lived in az for years and have yet to find a friendly reliable mechanic to work on my car i will now give all of my biz to marshall s service center in scottsdale  even though their prices are higher they are kind courteous professional and do a good job without complaining or being rude to customers there is nothing more that infuriates me than bad customer service as you can tell mr robbins very unprofessional response maam if you had read your coupon it states that an appointment is recommended but not required i guess you failed to see that but i have a great customer base that understands total maintinance not just oil changes if you had read and called to make sure that a bay was open i would have fit you into the schedule i guess ill just go into my doctor next time instead of making an appointment good day he was rude unprofessional and condescending to the wrong woman i will never go to any midas location again  i have put a call into the corporate office to see if this is how they train their franchisee s to treat their customers do not go to this midas
everything here was underwhelming the menu is huge and just like you would imagine after watching a few episodes of kitchen nightmares you know this is nt going to end well both meals were just not good  not terrible i m worried about food poisoning bad  but definitely not good the waitress took our drink orders immediately upon sitting and still we did nt get our drinks until halfway through our main course a second drink was never brought and we decided better to pay and leave than press the issue takeaway not worth it under any circumstances the decor is cheesy staff is underwhelming and the food disappoints turns out you ca nt have things on your menu and pull it off
i called around to board dogs for this thanksgiving found this place which seemed fine over phone told wife to check em out it took exactly ten seconds in the door before the employees there made my wife feel uncomfortable they did nt say hello instead barking at her are you here to pick up a dog  she told them she wanted to know more about the store and they suddenly seemed disinterested telling her we ll get someone to talk to you then let her stand for a few minutes while they returned to chatting casually a few minutes later a guy came out and again made her feel like she was taking up his valuable time she was nt allowed to see the play areas apparently the tour means partial tour i got a very stressed out phone call stating that there was no way in hell we were leaving our animals there two other businesses told us yeah we get a lot of business from them for that reason after hearing our story kind of a chronic problem then  business guys don t alienate new customers this is going to be a board and your competitor is getting our business so the next day we went to camp bow wow peoria wow the owner talked to janet on phone the day before for minutes we were greeted warmly and given a full tour by a very enthusiastic young lady and they only charge night for dogs vice  all the extra services you have to pay for lrb play time treats medicine administration baths etc at pete and macs its all inclusive at camp bow wow even free bath with night stay rrb the day we went out to see it the owner spoke with us for about  minutes including talking to me about the franchise lrb i am looking to buy a business rrb dogs are going for their free get acquainted visit tomorrow in preparation for their stay over thanksgiving and yes this review is getting posted for both businesses  rrb
if you have never been charged for cleaning and minor repairs before another tenant moves in to your recently vacated apartment then this is not the complex for you the heritage charged me for the following removing a few plastic bags from the apartment lrb rrb touch up paint on the walls when i had never damaged them lrb rrb carpet cleaning lrb rrb tile repair lrb i had nt damaged them at all rrb the fact is any apartment complex i have ever lived in cleans up and makes minor repairs before a new tenant moves in that is just part of maintaining an apartment complex i have never ever heard of charging former tenants for the minor clean up job necessary before new tenants move in i in now way left the apartment a mess and i was respectful of the space the entire lrb albeit short rrb time i lived there i am very disappointed that i was charged over for such things and i am currently disputing the charges other reasons i would not recommend living here the complex has some interesting characters walking around and it smells like a fish packing plant at night on a fairly regular basis if i could give this place no stars at all i would
oh gee i m sorry i ever came here then again it could have been what i ordered  pollo pizzaola i should have stuck to regular bar food but i just was nt in the mood for a burger pizza or wings if you decide to eat here just realize they have one type of sauce pizza sauce and it s not that great there are lot s of other places in the area with better food please do nt waste your money eating here
i wanted to talk with this gym about membership options but due to a tight schedule was only able to talk by phone i was told that was impossible and that if i was nt willing to come to the gym for the hard sell then i clearly was nt committed enough to my fitness goals what a way to guarantee nosale it is nice to know right away that everyone is just a number a body to them if they treat me so poorly when they want my money i can only imagine what the service is like once they ve got it no thanks gold s i deserve better
closednow traffic jam
where to start i am still upset my husband and i usually avoid chains but since we had the twins we are getting more intimate with some chains we were trying to find a new one since the other two we go to have been beaten to death with two year old twins choices are a little scary i went along and agreed to go to arriba last time we were there was years ago and it was your typical mediocre fare which is fine for a quick lunch during work week first we order for the kids the chicken fingers and what i thought would be strawberry smoothies what a surprise when i had a sip and realized it was a virgin strawberry daiquiri i was giving my twins pink sugar water not the end of the world i ordered some milk then my husband and i were going to share the chicken fajita quesadilla the waiter omar seemed fairly nice he came by a second time to verify if i wanted beef quesadilla and i told him no i want chicken no beef please then he pushed for us to add the guacamole and sour cream which i said fine to bring it with it and i repeated chicken quesadilla when it came the quesadilla looked like a sad greased soaked blanket my biggest surprise came when i took a bite and guess what i found  beef i had to spit it out and call omar i explained to him this was a beef quesadilla he gave me this puzzled face and asked you did nt want beef  i thought it was a joke by that time the twins were getting rowdy and they had not touch the rock hard fried to death chicken fingers so i told him to take off the quesadilla and we would pay for everything else we did nt eat but had ordered afterwards we called from the car and talked to the manager he wanted to do something for us but i told my husband i did nt want to go back so we did nt accept anything i guess cpk with the kids again
a shopping cart was missing after going through the carwash the manager said it was impossible because of surveillance equipment  could i prove the cart was in the car  it was in the car on the last stop before the wash but i did nt have a picture of the car interior as it entered the system i filled a complaint with the better business bureau but they have been unable to get a response for my request to replace the cart if you must go there take a picture of your car interior on your phone so you can pinpoint the location  time of picture to prove what was in your car
poor ariana s i do nt think they re going to make it at the rate they re going went with friends for lunch started out with ordering drinks although they have bottled water on the menu they ran out  but we had a wonderful water filtering system put in so tap water is good ice tea and lemonade came in small wine glasses and was very watered down when asking about refills was told they charge for refills then we find out they usually serve the drinks in larger glasses but they ran out lrb but now you re going to charge me for a refill of oz s of watered down tea  rrb after our discussion no charge for the refill friend ordered a dish with rice and a sauce on the side friend noticed the dish was chipped and did nt eat anything from it again after much discussion we were told we d only be charged  price for that order we told our server we wanted to see the manager if the guy who came out is the ownermanager they really are in trouble what are you guys critics  ummm excuse me but all your customers are critics ever heard of social media  he said we would nt be charged for the dish when the bill came we were charged  price what a joke i agree with julie k food was ok lrb not good or great rrb our server although somewhat scattered was very friendly and nice some places i give a change to redeem themselves this place is nt one of them
one pizza pp left all the twenty somethings in our group still hungry scant ingredients mediocre crust stingy with the cheese wedge salad was deplorable runny dressing over a sagging chunk of iceberg a few bacon bits better pizza at barros tommy s even costco cpk pizza needs to be heavierhartier especially in light of the cost around
customer service stinks  enough said i asked my doctor for a dermatologist referal and was given this guy in doing my own research i could nt find a web page for them besides a single page with no contact information i called and after immediately being put on hold for minutes i got hung up on yeah i really want to go there now  heck i do nt even trust my primary care doctor after this
might be one of the most disappointing dining experiences in north scottsdale we live in the area an wanted this to to a good go to place but poorly executed and way over priced dried up meat bun a size bigger than the patty and toasted dry lettuce wedge high onion slice a half inch thick on top of the patty trying to give the illusion of a big burger i guess and absolutely nothing else on the plate all is a la cart waiter said one order of fries wd serve no way just a normal size of very average fries for we all give this place months tops so if you want to try it be sure and check that they are still open how can you not know how to cook and serve a hamburger esp when that s your menu and you are charging top top dollar it s a mystery too bad but that s the chatter in the hood this place is in for a short run in no scottsdale we have too many fabulous restaurant choices
i paid for a so call sterling silver and turquoise ring on my way to a baseball game during the game i noticed that my ring finger was turning black i returned to the store after the game lrb couple hours after i had bought the ring rrb and expressed my disappointment and asked for my money back i was treated very rudely not only did the manager not give me my money back he threatened to call the police called me a crazy woman and ordered me out of his store i ve bought a lot of jewelry in my life and i ve never had anything discolor my skin and i ve never dealt with a jeweler who did nt stand by his merchandise and try to keep his customers happy
it s been a while since i have eaten here but when i last went i had a horrific experience i got the chicken salad which was full of dark meat bone gristle skin etc i had to run to the bathroom and get rid of it when i returned to the table i calmly explained to the manager i was unhappy with the food lrb you could see that the quality of food was really low rrb the manager was rude and i had to argue with him to remove the meal and my drink from the bill i would think that after a customer was caused to vomit he would have already taken my meal off the bill at the least i d never go back i wrote a letter to the head chef of the chain and copied the manager and got absolutely no response from either poor food poor service poor management that goes all the way up to the highest level
horrible food restaurant in poor condition bad smell in the air when you walk in the door
i ve lived here since it was managed by a different company and it was a really nice place quiet working class residents and families when the current mgt company took over it started to slowly take a turn for the worse first thing they did was try to hassle me about my recent lease renewal before the prior company left said i was paying to little sorry i signed the contract you have to honor it i agree with the other reviewers that stated how bad the customer relation skills of the employees in the leasing office are lrb with the exception of cj he is very pleasant and easy to talk to unfortunately he has no managerial power rrb less than a year ago i was on a month medical leave due to a kidney transplant my benefits were taking long to go through so i advised the office of my situation and wanted to work something out sorry no dice since it took an extra weeks to receive my funds lrb now i was over days late rrb they filed papers with a lawyer and i got served so the money i just got had to go to late fees plus the lawyer fees which were over alone i was nt allowed to set up a payment plan pay half or any other option nice way to treat a long term tenant they used to be so strict with issues such as picking up after your dog parking your car properly within the lines and noise problems sadly all these things have gone it s almost like dodging land mines everyday many of us have complained but their honest to goodness answer was well if we do nt know who it is we ca nt do anything about it maybe if you took a picture of them or told us the apt  so i should hide in the bushes with a camera or stalk the person  i asked if they could at least put out a letter asking residents to be more mindful and respectful they said no now i see abandoned cars with flat tires broken headlights and expired plates they used to have the vehicles towed just for having an expired plate the grills have been broken lrb handles burners self igniter etc rrb for well over years sadly the complex has mirrored the surrounding neighborhood a great deal the past few years even a lot of the residents are just rude and discourteous they ll park in your spot or take up both theirs and yours other neighbors have complained of their cars and apartments being broken into and yet we still have no type of security presence if you re a new tenant they are all smiles and welcome you in but as a current resident their expression conveys more of a what do you want  attitude you try to ask a question or ask for help with maybe dealing with problems in the common areas lrb like broken bbq grills rrb and you get a  yeah we know or a  we ll look into it nothing ever happens they do nt take care about the current and long term residents and because of all these issues many of the good people have left this for sure is my last lease it ca nt come fast enough if i m able to save up enough money i just may break it so i can get out
went there on a sunday night at pm  their kitchen was already closed some food plates were empty and never refilled unless you ask for it even thought there were still tables of customers there it s a family owned business i saw a young kid believed to be the owners playing around the dining area  this is unacceptable soon all the employees sit down on different tables started eating their dinner ca nt they see customers are still there  they should tell me their kitchen was closed but they did nt in other words they charged me to help them eat the leftovers  very nasty i will never go back again
i remember der wienerschnitzel from literally decades ago i enjoyed the hot dogs back then maybe because i was much younger what a sad excuse for a hot dog i had today i paid for the socalled chicagostyle hot dog it was loaded with relish lrb should be pickles rrb and minced onions lrb should be fresh onions rrb there were two ufo peppers off to the side i bit into one of them and could nt even break the skin instead it squirted all over the table two wafer thin tomato slices lrb should be wedges rrb and a minuscule wiener i mean i had to look to make sure the dog was even there the relish overpowered everything else terrible topping it off they only serve pepsi products
i am well aware that we are in phoenix and that practically everything is in a strip mall but noca is not deserving of all it s hype or it s high prices when they are nestled in between a safeway and a great clips i have heard so much about noca and i was really disappointed this place is way too cramped i was rubbing elbows with the table to my left annnnd right can a girl get some breathing room  the service was really great i always ask the silliest questions when i do nt recognize words on menus and they were very helpful unfortunately this was the best part about noca i ordered the spinach linguine i love pasta and was expecting the freshest past ever as promised by our waiter the pasta was nothing special and the seafood in it was terrible i ve had better scallops at a sample stand at costco and the halibut was very very very dry what s with the cotton candy  yes i love cotton candy howvever it made me think of eating at rawhide they too bring cotton candy before dessert they also send you home with a cowboy hat the only difference is that rawhide can cook a better dollar whatever steak than the hanger steak at noca take your money elsewhere
the worst shopping experience ever went in for a simple bagel butter banana  sprite my light lunch of choice working a delivery job in the heat the bakery was dark midday odd bagels not well displayed very few choices asked if i could get it toasted  some butter no we do nt toast ask the deli for butter asked the deli no butter is not on our condiment order list check the bakery a big disappointment since bashas offers to toast it and ask how many butters you d like when you are selecting a bagel on a positive note the wine department  steward looked impressive
one star because this place during summer and during happy hour could be tolerable for a very short time other than that  run away the have the worst music mix on a friday night it s ghettofabulous rap and crappy bon jovi lrb the entire place raised their fists and mouthed the lyrics to living on a prayer i swear rrb mixed drinks taste sooooooo much better i feel like such a winner paying x regular price of a regular drink coronas i saw a drunk chick fall into the little pool thingy nice one out of two had fake breasts seriously i counted i entertained myself by watching the ladies in  heels sink into the sand and their dates never never offered an arm to steady themselves they just watched them sink classy what scottsdale stereotype s   yeah right
just had daphnes for the last time in the times that we have ordered from them they can not seem to get a simple order right one kids burger with apple slices lrb nope rrb one side of hummus lrb nope rrb but they are quick to charge you for the order then you call and talk to a girl name liz and she begins to tell you that they are correct and you the customer are wrong even though i have all the food sitting in front of me nope still no kids burger or side of hummus hmmmmm keep letting her answer the phone and you will see your to go customer base decline we are an office in scottsdale that everyday is ordering lunch for the office daphnes has officially been removed from the menu book nice customer service
food took way too long
years ago this place had some great food now not so much chicken fried steak is bland the salad has very little greens to it and the apitizer bread they serve is cold they used to have the best cfs around but in the last few years or so its beaten out by a denny s dinner
very sad about blanco i love fox restaurants and was shocked that this is connected to that company my hubby and i did a quick date night last week and chose blanco since we have seen it so many times in passing the guac was and seriously the size of a golf ball served in a large bowl i ordered a dinner salad i think it was for a bread sized plate of lettuce a couple tomatos and avacados and about a half a pound of dressing i usually get extra dressing on the side but no need for that at this place my lettuce was wilted from the amount of dressing on the salad this would not have been terrible if it was good but it tasted terrible my husband took the waiters recommendation and ordered enchiladas that was probably the best thing about our experience however it tasted like cream of mushroom soup out of the can and came in a little petite size skillet for i think or bucks i would never go back not even for half price i will stick to sauce and fox sports grill for mexican i will make the long drive to val vista and baseline to eat at nandos nothing compares to their food
wow the chicken was too burned and they charged me for grilling the tomatoes and onions but did nt tell me when i objected they just said oh well not for me there are too many other good med places in tempe
stopped by before the game to pickup wings and a salad the wings were like dessert mummies dry with no sauce lrb we ordered hot rrb the antipasto salad was  lettuce and no dressing try any place else but here
service and management is poor and inconsistant one minute we were told we could pay cents to add pinnapple to their pizza special as it was not one of the or so toppings and sub mozzarella for provolone on the hoagie five minutes later the waitress returned to say the manager that had originally told her yes to our requests had been yelled at and we needed to place a different order she explained something about food cost being the reason but last time i checked mozzarella cheese and pinnapple are not expensive items and beyond that you do not tell a table one thing and come back mins later and say something different disappointed in the mellow mushroom today  lrb
on the menu cupcakes never in stock  cupcakes the yogurt is subpar at best but i keep going back because they advertise at having cupcakes and frozen drinks at toppings the toppings they must rotate because there is no way they have and where do they make frozen drinks  behind the wall somewhere  i do nt think i d like to have a frozen drink made somewhere i ca nt see it so today i decide to call ahead and find out if they have cupcakes on the menu first i was routed into a general voicemail box a few times then i got a hold of a live person but not at the location i wanted when i asked him about the cupcakes he said we actually do nt have any cupcake inventory today lrb who says that  rrb i explained that i had bought a groupon specifically due to the fact that they advertised having cupcakes and my daughters love cupcakes and now i ve been in several times and no cupcakes ever they act like it s a totally random thing like oh gee we re out of them today really  every time  so when i explained to this guy that this was the case and asked him when they have them lrb so maybe i could try planning ahead next time rrb and he hung up on me nice service not so yeah do nt think i ll be going back and i wo nt be surprised at all when they are closed in just a few months
 ugh poor quality inconsistant bagels why are my bagels different thickness  i did nt order thin bagels when did asiago cheese become a cheese pancake   cashier tells me that the asiago cheese has always been thin lrb um no they have nt rrb this should nt had been served to customers  saw the young highschool employee dude throw some bacon into the microwave euw no napkin no plate no wax paper wth   slow service stuck behind an indecisive lady ugh cmon lady chose a damn bagel and ice tea and move along  the cashier was a young lrb inexperienced rrb gal who had the iq of a potato it was obvious she did nt know how to work the register either why bother having people like this handle money transactions   parking is ok  it was way too much of a hassle to run in to get a bagel here poor food quality terrible service inconsistant food quality and inexperienced employees lrb  next time i ll go into a safeway to get a bagel less hassle  worst einsteins that i have ever been to is this one a franchise 
well i was with that little group of who decided to stop for drink and chat saturday about pm lrb december rrb yes when we walked in the waitress was seated with a patron smoking a cigarette lrb delightful scent on her and her clothing not rrb which made her stink so yes she was engaged in a conversation while seated with a male patron lrb nothing like making yourself at home with the clientele rrb and using the fword loudly multiple times no other patrons were on the patio lrb figures rrb so we pick a table and because there were of us we scooted one table closer to another so we could hear each other above the tooloud music so the umbrellas were moved one under the other and the waitress wearing eaudeashtray perfume ran over and admonished us that they lrb umbrellas rrb break easily neither umbrella broke what ll you have to drink  she asks then we said we would like to have something to eat and asked if she could bring us menus she brings the menus then i asked if she could turn down the lrb too loud freaking rrb music speaker right over our heads and she said not really a lot of people are out drinking well now is nt that grand logic  gosh i loved her intellect brainy women always turn me on this was just too much and one of the others suggested we go elsewhere since the volume of music would have required us to shout to one another as drunks often do in noisy bars but we were sober so we left having read the other reviews here it was a wise choice because we might have also have been subjected to the bartenders that were in those other reviews labeled axeholes we found refuge at the marriot one block south with a lovely quiet restaurant where we could actually hear each other and where the wait staff was all one could askwonderfully polite and attentive
is there really no great thai in scottsdale  after a disappointing visit to malee s on main last year i decided to try swaddee thai on this visit to scottsdale the restaurant is casual but clean and decorated nicely but the service is unfriendly and the food is just ok i ordered veggie spring rolls which appeared to be raw on the menu but arrived deep fried for my entree i ordered a yellow curry chicken the curry sauce was thin and watery not at all like the thicker sauce i m used to it was nt bad i just was nt impressed
this might be the worst food i have ever eaten at least i did nt get sick
while the staff are great i m not thrilled with dr ben while initially for a  check up he was great but when further work had to be done he became arrogant and refused to listen to my concerns he was unwilling to work together to find a suitable solution to my problem  as he way was the best and only for a quick check up you might want to give him a go but for any further dental procedures i d find a dentist who is willing to discuss things with you listen to your concerns and problems and not put his hand up to stop you talking because he does nt want to listen
while i was eating a coach roach ran across my table i immediately stopped eating and threw it in the trash and left disgusted
in all ways no way should you live at broadstone ancala property management style is unprofessional and problem resolution is questionable the ventilation is horrible and air conditioning does nt seems to do much there are cheap materials used in the renovated apartments only one pool seems to be operating at a time so you are forced to use the front swimming pool with all the kids and beer guzzlers i could go on but not worth the time do yourself a favor if you are looking to live in scottsdale keep on looking
if you enjoy watching flies that require ground clearance from the faa prior to taking off buzz around you as you eat your authentic mexican food then you are in for a treat here as for me i do nt particularly enjoy dining in an establishment that clearly has no time for meeting some minimal health  sanitation standards disgusting
so sad i went here the other day craving the zbq pizza only to see that they are now closed
went in on a sunday midmorning seated promptly then completely ignored from that point on got up and left after minutes the hostess gave us a blank stare as we walked out and told her no one would wait on us the staff did not seem to care at all this is not the type of attitude and service you want from a place that prepares your food  danger stay away
good food pricey very loud lots of kids ok service atmosphere of a coffee shop
absolutely disgusting horrible fries rancid tasting oily beef careless staff way overpriced steer clear
you know what differentiates a lot of tomato based mexican food from fucking italian  oregano and basil both of which were in your hot salsa today i put quotation marks around that because i guess it was supposed to be spicy but it tasted more like sloppy joe mix than chiles i did nt ask for a freakin mexitalian burrito consistently the worst pseudomexican food in the business the best thing that can be said for it is it ll form a turd pure fuel not food
first of all it s for a bowl of pho that s way over price the soup was disgustingly bland and the one of the owners was walking around like a vietnamese hitler runway model pacing back and for in the restaurant the interior decor was dark and reminded me second hand ikea store i would never come back here and if you re smart take your business elsewhere you been warned
so today was the last straw i am a new customer to starbucks and have visited this store on several occasions and for the most part the employees have been efficient but very grumpy i have on two occasions in the past month spoken to the manager about it  i think his name is john  about the grumpy people that work there on the phone he promised me a free drink the next time i was in lrb which he conveniently forgot when i asked him about it rrb the first few times i was in i was waited on by a young lady who never smiled lrb actually it was more of a scowl rrb and when i interacted with her she was blank faced and sour in her reactions this was the person i spoke to the manager about today i was served by a young lady who basically threw my drink at me lrb energetically rrb and when i asked for extra ice she scowled at me never said thanks smiled or offered any pleasantries basically the service in that store s   ks i have been in there multiple times and have never really gotten anything close to what i would call happy service thought you should know unfortunately i will not be going into that store again greg
the gym will be closed in june their reason  lease is up 
apparently pischke s used to be a fun personalityfilled destination for yummy brunch which is why my friend aaron guided us there one early afternoon unfortunately since aaron s last visit changes have been made now pischke s is a bland eatery with a rather uninspired limited menu positioned at the aspirational eating price point as far as i can tell pischke s target customer is well off older people who are looking for unchallenging options and prices high enough to keep out the riff raff pischke s no longer serves daily brunch so we had lunch on our visit among our group of six not one of the dishes stood out in a positive way the burger and salads were average the crepes were decent but small and nothing special the pork verde was fine but inexplicably served with buttered flour tortillas the pot pie was atrocious  a deconstructed take on the typical comfort food it consisted of a large bowl filled with extremely bland pot pie filling topped by a thin layer of philo dough flakes it was devoid of everything lrb taste crust rrb that makes a pot pie good the food was complimented by very poor service our waiter was totally smarmy and condescending my drink order went unfilled and when the food was served the waiter had coded the seats wrong so every single meal was placed in front of the wrong person highly unimpressive while phoenix may not be known as a fine dining destination there are plenty of great restaurants in the area to patronize instead do nt waste your calories time or money at pischke s
if you live near fresh water lrb san francisco seattle rrb do nt eat fish here everything  everything is frozen sand dab no  scallops  no prawns eh no  even frying it did nt help just do nt eat fish in az veggies are good wait staff is good mojito was great  not a mix
why did i agree to go here  blaaaaaah even for fast casual japanese food it sucked i got the lowcarb lrb no rice rrb teriyaki salmon bowl the vegetables  a mix of cabbage broccoli and carrots  had no flavor whatsoever it was like hospital cafeteria veggies ever hear of salt or using a flavored broth  the sauce on the salmon was ok but once you eat off the top layer no flavor inside at all it was not worth or whatever the price i rarely go so far as to say oh i could have cooked better at home but in this case it s true one of the worse meals i can remember having and their shiu mai dumplings obviously frozen and then cooked because a rrb way too laborintensive otherwise and b rrb that had more flavor how can it be next door to cherry blossom noodle  i need a good meal to counteract this
be careful when you order happy hour drinks do nt open a tab last night we went to celebrate a friend who graduated and is leaving the country and came at the beginning of the  happy hour we were a pretty large group and our waitress was very attentive ensuring that we all had fresh drinks when required my boyfriend and i each had two old fashioneds lrb olds fashioned  rrb which were watered down and full of ice but for we were nt complaining however when we requested our check at lrb fifteen minutes after happy hour ended rrb our waitress gave us a group check for almost with everyone charged full price for their drinks when we complained she said that she had no way of knowing what time any of us ordered our drinks so she could nt give us the happy hour prices even though we had been there for two hours suddenly what should have been a check became including an outrageous autogratuity this may not matter to the typical old town scottsdale crowd but we are graduate students and ca nt afford a bar tab like that so thanks mabel s for stealing my food budget for the week with every bowl of ramen i ll think of you
after a promising response after my previous yelp review i was pleased to see them reaching out to reconcile the poor service i received at the restaurant after months i have not received the alleged giftcard would have been nice to use that giftcard to give them a second shot but i guess not
on november th i brought my vacuum here to get fixed too much cat hair two months later i got it back the first three weeks i spent calling asking if the thing had been fixed as i was told it would take about five days and would receive a call when it was ready a week later i tried calling it was near impossible to get the guy that apparently fixes that vacuums on the phone i was told i would receive a call back never got a call forgetting about it three weeks later i was successful and was told my vacuum had mistakenly never been moved from the waiting to be fixed pile no apologies but was again told i will receive a call when it was fixed never got a call at that point i was morbidly curious to see just how long it could be for the goddamn thing to get fixed a month later i called for shits and giggles and was told it had been ready and i can come and pick it up never got a call or message telling me it had been ready never again
the fox corporation owns this one along with it s next door neighbor j alexanders i havent made a meal in my kitchen for years and depend upon the good restauranteurs of phoenix for sustanence sadly these two places mentioned herein are now off the rotation list of places to eat we have watched the corporate cutbacks on food quality gradually decline into unacceptable levels september rd i ordered fish tacos with a side of guacomole what i got was three miniscule inch tortillas each containing a very small less than bite size piece of fish i have seen these small tortillas at other eateries served as appetizers in portions of three just like this offering the fish tacos were about bucks the side of guacomole was bucks even if the food was excellent lrb which it was far from rrb the portion size was pathetic just a bad deal all way around locals avoid it now and apparently the locale next to several hotels may keep it going unsuspecting tourists be warned avoid this one
one star because they flat out lied to us this is the sort of thing i loathe about so many american businesses they are willing to lose potentially lifelong customers for the sake of saving or so here is what happened we wanted to get a shelter dog but it quickly became apparent that the right mix of breed and age was going to be difficult to find at a shelter lrb i have a preschool age son and two cats so we thought a puppy would be the best fit rrb so we started to look at breeders and private families one day we decided to stop here just to look at a variety of breeds in one place with no intention of actually buying anything there the thing is they had this little dachshund puppy that we really fell in love with the price was too high but they came down and said when we picked him up we would be able to draw from a bucket and receive either or worth of store credit we finally decided to bite the bullet and pay way more than expected figuring at least the drawing would allow us to get his supplies at the time he had an ear infection and we had to wait ten days to pick him up you can guess what happened we show up to get the dog and they tell us that we do not get to draw because of the deal they made us at the beginning and a kennel they gave us that day during the course of the ten day wait we had been visiting the puppy at the store so i was not about to tell my four year old to forget about his puppy so of course i still took the dog but they are now on my list of most hated businesses along with thrifty rentacar and olive garden  the sort of place i will talk about for the rest of my life it is a shame because up until this time our experience was positive
bad service really really bad food is okay
roaring fork happy hour go there and try their big ass burger lrb that s literally what it s called rrb they have a happy hour all night very nice atmosphere once you ve tried their burger fudruckers just wo nt cut it i paid less to eat a gourmet hamburger at a table cloth restraurant than at fudruckers for me it s not about how many toppings or condiments you can put on a hamburger it s the quality of the meat bread buns etc roaring fork way better than fudruckers
this is my second review of arriba mexican grill in glendale and i m sorry to say this will be my last because i am not going to return to this place again again the stacked beef enchilada s were void of any flavor at all although the food presented well i mean it looked good but my goodness it was just terrible the bland meat was simply browned in a skillet without any flavoring at all and then shoved on to a corn tortilla and then covered with what was supposed to be red chili sauce there was supposed to be some of those world famous hatch green chilies mixed in with the meat as well but again  zip nothing when our waiter finally came by i asked for some chili on the side and a beer thinking i could salvage this mess but after a long long wait still no chili and no beer finally my wife caught his eye and a few minutes later i had my request on the table but it was no use this meal was dead what a disappointment i know this restaurant can make pretty good new mexican food but something has changed at this store  either the manager is cutting corners by saving money on spices or she is just incompetent because this place is capable of better service and better food i just have nt seen it in a long time what a disappointment i was anxious to leave this bad experience behind but it was nt that easy no check again poor service  then at last after about minutes our awol waiter finally shows up with our check and we are at last able to leave our  eaten meals behind
i took my two cats here and sadly had to put one down they were an okay establishment but nothing that screamed world class in my book when my daughter came across a newborn cat on the sidewalk i drove straight over to the vet where i had spent upwards of on animal visits over the previous few years upon bringing in this dayold kitten with little knowledge of how to keep it alive i was told by the office manager that they do nt take animals in off the streets they get paid by the county to take in animals and with that i was no longer a customer of tricity east family vet care of mesa however won me over read their review
greasy hole in the wall joint i gave it one star but please read the review ok the food i had was very good lrb bordering on delish actually rrb but keep reading this is a strange place superhero decor all over the place and spiderman was playing on the wall plamsa tv it was too dark to see the movie though lrb do nt know why maybe the tv was broke or the light from the nearby window was too much hmmmmmm rrb rrb i got a regular burger special it was yummers good fries they have different types of burgers breakfast hours a day and gyros they also have all types of deep fried desert treats too but herein lies the problem i was nt even half way finished eating when i literally was attacked by flies lots of them they were all over the area i was sitting at they kept landing in my food on my face in my hair etc and so forth i was like what the heck  i looked around and noticed that the place was pretty filfthy and swarming with even more flies it was pretty disgusting i left too bad because i really liked the food i wanted to come back and try some other things but i wo nt it only takes one case of previous food poisoning to become very paranoid about things like that i am not even the world s pickiest neat freak but i do nt know what was going on in there tonight so my questions for mike are why all the flies and why such a dirty restaurant  ewhhhhhhhhhhh it was like some really bad hitchcock movie lrb no joke rrb
ok if you are a little kid and like chicken nuggets nothing i would ever return for blan
this restaurant closed down about a year lrb or more rrb ago
worst place to go if you really want to eat and enjoy bad food complimented with worst service possible in this world ambiance is ok ok kinds only good thing is it is not one of those restaurants which looks like rat holes staff is not at all courteous and it looks like they do nt know how to smile to your customers looks like they are only paid to serve not to treat their customers well we orders some dishes and gobi paranthas they came back after mins informing us that they are out of flour and so can serve only we said okay but were shocked to hear such an excuse anyhow that was not the end when they actually brought food they told us that they do nt even have a single so they chose for us to bring plain naan lrb not even asking us or apologizing rrb wait that was not the end too when they brought the check it was having an extra beer which we never ordered and when i pointed this out to the owner he behaved as if i had done a crime pointing this out he said how can you blame us like this we put only those things that we ordered and refused pointblank to accept the mistake overall a strict no no for this place
not a good meal meatballs and chickpea crepes were too salty eggplant and spinach was an unappetizing greasy pile of slime and tasted oily the meatballs were accompanied by truly tasteless tomato sauce the pasta was nothing special crispy brussels sprouts were anything but undercooked and chewy and three slices of bread was brought to the table with just enough olive oil for two slices
tonight was our second time at this chompie s and had i written this review after our first visit i would have given it stars however after the service we received tonight we will not back after reading other reviews one can only assume that the borenstein s have made so much money that they could care less about what kind of service their patrons get we arrived around pm and the restaurant was not very crowded yet my husband order a soup and sandwich and i ordered the jewish sliders long story short every table around us received their food even though they arrived after us it took so long that the couple next to us commented on how long our food was taking lrb at this point they were almost done with their meal rrb not being able to locate our server i went up to the hostess and asked if someone could find out where our food was in less than a minute the manager lrb phil rrb magically plots the food on the table and says the sliders just take a really long time no apology nothing without going into the a lengthy description of the dialogue that followed between my husband and phil suffice it to say that phil had real attitude for manager at no time did he offer an apology free dessert or to take anything off the bill he practically blamed us for being too impatient to make matters worse right after phil left the table our server justin decide to continue with the attitude he asked us how everything was and my husband replied that he did nt know yet because we just got our food justin did nt seem to understand why my husband was so upset and my husband explain about the wait for the food justin s reply well you have your food now what s the problem  i left out lot s of detail but you get the picture they could give a crap about service i do nt care how good the food is but rude service with attitude especially from management is never acceptable we will not be back
went there for lunch around not expecting it to take minutes for a salad sadly this place is under staffed and lacking everything needed to be a good lunch spot i do nt recommend it if you want a good sandwich place drive down the street to dilly s deli or any of the other sandwich shops in tempe your wallet your time and your stomach will thank you

so you re with a bunch of people who like chicken fried steak and they say hey theres this steak house you should try with us this should be your first warning if a steak house is known for its chicken fried steak something is not right maybe you re different maybe you think sure they like chicken fried steak and i like fried asshole then this is your place now you go in and ahh the ambiance shit on the walls as far as the eye can see oh and not just the walls the ceiling as well its jam packed you ca nt hear the person in front of you you re thinking when s the last time they dusted all this crap  how much falls in my food from the lazy ceiling fans its hot and a bit humid to maybe to recreate that true texas experience  so you order your tbone medium rare side of mashed potatoes and hell some okra while you re at it good okra is hard to find in these parts the okra crispy soft inside lrb once its done being molten lava rrb perfect do nt bother with the sauce unless your garnish for okra is tartar sauce hey a side salad come with it oh the tiny diced tomatoes ice burg lettuce and what an interesting mix diced green olives all over the top in giant piles now your entree comes but the waitress if you re lucky has worked there years shes got a blond dye job too much eye makeup and a perm she makes sure to leave every single dish on the table just in case you missed one delicious crumb at some point she might drop by one basket of rolls for a table of the buttermilk ones taste homemade not bad oh yes the entree a tbone super thin in what is that  its pooling everywhere oh god the grease you did order your steak with a large slathering of grease right  well those mashed potatoes which are thick and standard are drenched in heavy white gravy and all the blandness of the gravy helps soak up all that grease so you re almost done with your food omg your giant glass is empty  where was that waitress  oh do nt worry just grab her by the arm and she ll try to remember to refill your drink and those extra plates well if they re really bothering you you can ask a bus person to take them though you might as well be asking them to lick your shoe lrb or eat what you just did rrb now you re full you ve paid and because of its prime location you get to cross a busy intersection to get to the car you had to park across the street might as well just wait to get home to pee too its sweltering in there more crap on the walls and ceiling and you pretty much have to stand on the toilet to get the stall door closed
man was i disappointed i ordered for delivery and was told it would take  minutes it actually took an hour and to arrive so first impression not the best but it got here and was hot and smelled really good i got the food opened and started serving and when i scooped into the curry chicken i was disgusted the chicken was raw very raw it was so bad i was afraid to try any of the food i called to tell them what happened and it did nt seem to matter much but they did give me my money back i was really hoping it would be good because my husband and i have been looking for chinese delivery place in the area after that experience my search continues

would never go here again hosted a grp of professionals and wanted to try something different sadly disappointed  and food poisoned summary of menu items tried coconut shrimp prepared from frozen and shrimp was not deveined lrb gross rrb salad bar fresh but far from interesting for the price filet totally unseasoned tasted like boiled tough and chewy could not finish teriyaki fillet medallions sauce from a bottle from safeway very bad and chewytough sea bass was nt sea bass was prepared from frozen overcooked and totally unseasoned orzo reheated from yesterday with a skin on top service knew that  tip mandatory was terrible inattentive and slow only reason i paid the mandatory tip is because i did nt want to make a scene with all of my guests i am not happy with the ripoff that the chart house gave us tonight that waiter made over in mandatory tips from my bill i am blessed to have been successful in business and i am normally pleased to pay my bills  but i worked very hard for my money and i hate being ripped off and the chart house ripped me off called management later to complain about the low quality food and service will see what happens to be fair and will update this manager on the phone said that he would inform corporate about our complaint should note that two guests lrb the ones that had the caesar salads rrb ended up getting very ill later that night the likely culprit is food poisoning from the caesar salads all in agreement lrb several of us are physicians and nurses rrb
my two girlfriends and i bought groupons for manicures  pedicures i did nt realize when i bought it that it was a school but i figured it would be ok i was wrong the school is in a tiny storefront upon walking in it seems messy dirty and unorganized the nail polish selections were almost all  empty and old my nail tech caused my pinkie finger to bleed and destroyed my cuticles i have had more hangnails these last few days after the manicure than i ve ever had in my life i received a piss poor hand massage during my manicure and no massage during my pedicure we were supposed to get a spa pedicure but we just had our feet soaking in plastic bins i could nt tell if anyone there was an instructor or supervisor no one came by to supervisor my tech s work or ask me if i was happy with my service my girlfriend paid extra to have tips put on her gel manicure poor thing her nails look terrible the color was uneven and thick probably because the polish was old my other girlfriend s pedicure looked awful because the polish was so old it went on thick and clumpy on her toes the only good thing about this experience is that the staff was somewhat friendly i would never recommend this place to anyone

very disappointing my boyfriend and i are from austin texas and we were so excited to visit jimmy buffets margaitaville only to be greeted with horrible customer service the hostesses told us we can seat ourselves outside which is understandable but we sat there for minutes without being greeted by a waiter and it was nt even busy i told the hostess we havent been waited on and told her where we were sitting and she looked confused and said okay minutes later we got up and told them we would go eat somewhere else and the hostesses that were his standing there said okay in a sarcastic way i was so dissapointed because we even had our food picked out because we looked at the menu online and wanted to visit the gift shop to buy some jimmy buffet souveniers we worked retail and understand the wait and how customer service works but this was absolutely a horrible experience sad to say that considering we are jimmy buffet fans
i was so disappointed to have bad experiences here since its close by and would have really been convenient they seem to have owners one nice and one just really strange i had a groupon or yelp on so i thought it would be great to get a couple entrees and be able to try some stuff since i planned on eating there pretty often grabbing take out on the way home from work yes me and smg were going to be new bff s loving carne asada i ordered that and the manager kept trying to get me to order an app like guacamole which is wierd the apps are all around  dollars same price as entrees he was so annoying i thought perhaps was upset since prob everyone was ordering entrees off that for groupon so i thought i would make it easy on him and just get the green chili dip well it was awful and so spicy it burned my lips off at home so i was so disappointed that i didnt just go outside with the menu so i could focus and order what i really wanted so i called him and he was really argumentative and kept insisting it wasnt too spicy so anyway he finally agreed to let me get something else well actually he only told me he would exchange it for the guacamole so whatever i took back the nearly full container of it the next night and he kept insisting it wasnt spicy in phoenix customers are garbage so im used to really lousy service plus i think he was more of a woman hater too but anyway i took pics which i will have to post as they are so hilarious but my guacamole was also so spicy i guess they put maybe jalapeno juice in everything there it all seems to have that burning quality but my quac comes in a smal plastic container wtih not one but of the avacado pits unbeliveable so i guess he wanted to give me the least amount of guac he could anyway i never went back i go to loco patron where they treat me like gold and their food is so awesome but i will post these avacado pit pics soon they are hilarious
agonizingly slow service tepid mediocre food salsa from a jar
i was excited to try this restaurant after reading the reviews sadly i was majorly disappointed we arrived after the lunch crowd yet had to wait a very long time for our food to arrive we started with the table side guacamole and the avocado was not ripe enough the chicken taco horrible and pumpkin bread pudding too sweet do not arrive starving because the wait staff moves like turtles i give this a three at best not worth the
horrible most of the employees including some who were apparently off duty were too busy hanging around chatting with each other to get orders packed correctly interact with customers in a friendly manner or clean the disgusting bathrooms and customer seating area edited to add this followup complained to kfc about the lousy service wrong food and disgusting dirty conditions got a standard apology letter with a certificate usable only at the location we told them we d never go to again way to go kfc way to listen to your customers not that they have to since they re so big but it makes me question myself every time i get a thought about visiting any of their stores and i ve stopped myself from going there from time to time
stelagtites i could make this review just that one word but i ll explain my night a little more indepth to please the yelp gods it started at exactly pm on friday night three of the whitest dudes around looking for trouble after being told there was no cover until lrb a couple minutes earlier and perhaps  rrb and one dollar drafts by the staff and then waiting in line to get in until they tried to charge us a cover wait a second we were just told there was nt one and we were in line before pm but bouncer mcbouncy over there was doing second id checks presumably to take longer  we ended up paying for the three of us such a negotiable price that i felt like i was in rocky point at the donkey show still though draft beers thats all i was looking for finally getting into the place it was dead with maybe people in there but at least the bar was empty so we pulled up and ordered our beers they came in the little dixie cups that the hospital gives you to take your meds with when you dont really want fluids ok so it was a little bigger than that but it was an oz disposable plastic cup i had of them which is oz and cost me that was approximately regular beers and would have cost me as bottles were each so it was still kind of a deal we hung out in the back area mostly as they had some nice cushy chairs and the music was a little quieter i also noticed the abundance obscenely overweight women did nt go back there much maybe it took too much effort it was our sanctuary out of nowhere i looked up and saw stelagtites what the fuck is that all about  they were cut into the ceiling in lieu of ceiling tiles mystified as i was i was also drunk so i shrugged it off but looking back it really was a cheap ass place full of crappy attitudes and tackiness yet another bar for kids to shoot each other in
waited mins for partly wrong order red jade chicken was over cooked had a full restaurant of waiting people somethings going wrong in that kitchen equivalent to fast food except for the wait should ve went to original in phx
if this is fish and chips then i m a monkeys uncle they served some sort of red sauce that i think had horseradish in it for your dipping sauce for the fish what the hell is that fish and chips get served with either lemon and tartare sauce and malt vinegar for your chips wont be going back there ever
do not stay here they charged my credit card for services not rendered i had to contest the charges with my credit card company
just had some about minutes ago no
well let me tell up front we never got to eat we changed our table from a two top to a three at pm on a tuesday night in the dead of summer and that put us into the  hourwait stratosphere of seating so we left after two hours this is not sour grapes because of that i said i was going to review the bar and i am the bar was terrible i despise a bartender who is so  whats the word   spoiled that she only has to serve whoever is standing in front of her because business is so good any bartender wither their salt monitors the bar s comings and goings keeps tabs on some rough order of service and is rewarded with generous tips by seasoned diners who appreciate having their turn honored they did nt have one of those bartenders the red wine special they offered at a glass had begun to turn so that could be a reason they were pouring it off on the yokels they had two tap beers  both bitter  and we had a bar tab which i know is nothing but that s also what we got let me tell you something all yelpsters and bar owners of the world the bartender is the ambassador to your business that s all you need to know for training and service ambassador to your business wake up earn money a good bartender could have cajoled us to stay
i do nt like to give places a star review unless i have either gotten sick or had a really bad experience i sort of had a combination of the two at china magic noodle house i saw a groupon for this restaurant a couple days ago and it looked simple and good so i went ahead and bought it i am always in the mood for noodles so i was excited to try this place and it was right down the street from my house so sunday afternoon we decided to eat here for lunch i have been sitting on this experience for two days now and i feel that i am not giving a harsh review based on my experience we walk in around pm and there were only a few tables being served the first thing that hits me is the smell of this place my first thought was that it smelled like urine i m sure it was just a combination of the spices and whatever was being made in the kitchen but it was not a mouth watering smell like you should experience when you walk into a restaurant i should have turned right around and went home but we stayed so we sit down and someone brings over some water and some boiled peanuts and pickled vegetables i still am not sure if this was supposed to be some kind of appetizer or a garnish for the noodles it was a little weird so i decided on the spicy vegetarian noodle dish and my husband decides on the vegetables and fried noodle dish and a strawberry smoothie i see that there are spring rolls on the menu as well there is a language barrier here with the waiters so when i asked if the spring rolls were vegetarian at first she just thought i was ordering them but after asking three times whether or not they were vegetarian i think she finally understood what i was asking so i was a little bit concerned about these everything came out really fast like around minutes fast the spring rolls were vegetarian but they tasted like they came out of a freezer bag and the vegetables inside were really limp and not crisp at all a couple packets of mustard and some gelatin like duck sauce come with the rolls i did nt use either how hard would it be to make a really simple nice sauce for the rolls  my noodles come out first and at first they look really good and i was excited however as i am eating them i am noticing some weird textures in the supposedly vegetarian sauce it tasted almost like some kind of seafood and it was gritty i did nt finish it and when i asked two different waitresses what was in the sauce neither of them could tell me which is concerning i ca nt feel good going back to a place that ca nt tell me whats in the vegetarian sauce my husband liked his noodles but he is nt as paranoid about what his food is made out of as i am his smoothie tasted like a slushie you get at  i am sure it was made with some kind of red dye and not fresh strawberries sickeningly sweet as well about an hour later we are walking around target and my stomach starts to burn i feel this intense burning sensation in my stomach for the next two days i think there is some kind of issue with msg here possibly i do nt know what else could have made me feel like that i also did nt eat pretty much anything for the next two days because of how bad my stomach felt the only cool thing about this place is the guy who pulls noodles in the big window in the middle of the restaurant prices are also pretty cheap its cash preferred as well other than that i am sorry to say i wo nt be back
yuk will never eat here again it was dis organized and food was undercooked and tasteless honestly  that s really all i have to say about this place sadly enough will not be going back
there is no wonder this place is out of business they deserve a  star when they first opened i decided to give them a try everyone wants to try a new pizza place at first it looked like family business that probably made some good pies when in reality pizza hut or dominos is better and i do nt order that kind of pizza the pizza looked like a frozen pizza thrown into an oven and shoved into a crappy box the bottom of the pizza had the little dots just like a frozen pizza from the grocery store but the funny thing is the frozen grocery store pizza tastes better than this did too the sauce was l swear from a jar that read pizza sauce and the directions said pour over pizza dough yuck just terrible and when i saw that they were out of business i smiled and said yes now hopefully something good can go there in its place years ago it was port of subs and i have missed them ever since lrb
dirty that about sums this place up walked into this place because i was in the area and i had not been to one of these in years the food is okay but once i had ordered my meal i began to notice how dirty the place was the floors had dirt stains on them and no one had mopped up there was a small bucket sitting on the service counter that had a rag in it an some type of cleaning solution for wiping down the tables the trash cans behind the counter were viewable and they were full and had trash laying on the floor around them and the final things i noticed were the condiments bar and the drink area were dirty and had not been wiped up in quite awhile stay away from this place
i stopped in because of a coupon offer and had wanted to try them out for awhile i was pleased to see that there were plenty of menu items and lots of types of smoothies however all the good things about this place were wiped out for me because of the actions of one of the employees after placing my order and paying i watched an employee make my smoothie as my drink was blending she reached for an empty cup in preparation for the transfer but she missed and knocked it onto the ground instead of throwing that cup away and getting a new one she bent down picked the cup off the ground proceeded to transfer my smoothie from the blender into the dirty cup then handed it to me like there was nt anything wrong i called her on it and she proceeded to make me a new smoothie albeit reluctantly because she was clearly agitated that i asked for a replacement it s too bad really because i could nt enjoy my smoothie without freaking out just a little bit with every sip you d think it would be common sense move to replace the soiled cup but if that employee did nt care that i saw her drop then reuse my cup who knows what other unsanitary practices they use out of sight when they prep the other foods they sell here   note  this experience happened to me on april and i have not returned to the business this employee may already be long gone
service was less than average the waitresses nails were realyl really long which i would have to question how clean they were my ice tea was served with a teaspoon in it so i was grossed out and decided not to eat just sat there and let my other fruends enjoy there meals yuck
very disappointed in this store i went in one morning to get their oil changing special during the process of my oil being changed the mechanic and store clerk told me that my brakes were scratching really bad i was shocked because my breaks did not indicate they were going out or even a sign of screechingscratching i told him i did nt have time or money to get them replaced so i will have to come back in a week i was going to see if a family friend could fix them since he was a mechanic when i drove out all of a sudden i heard this horrible screeching sound and you can hear the scratching i did nt understand it so i had our friend look at them he told me that they pulled out a pin so the car would make the scratch noise and i did nt need the brakes fixed if anything i could maybe replace the pads i was pissed off that brakemasters would do that he said that s how they get you so shame on brakemasters for not only trying to scam me out of paying for their services but for tampering with my brakes never will i go to brakemasters beware of this store
great food but terrible take out service it s weird when a place has perfect pizza but terrible service i ordered a large pie for takeout minutes later i m there to pick it up and it s not ready no problem i can hang out and the employee said it would be three minutes ten minutes later i m just standing there looking bored while literally five employees are just standing around complaining that one table has someone who ca nt eat onions or garlic i finally go up and ask someone to check on my pizza the man i asked looked like i asked him if he could deliver a baby underwater just totally perplexed then he went and checked and sure enough it was sitting in the back he gives me my pizza and i ask if it s sliced and he gives me a look and says yah it s sliced i get in the car and check and sure enough  it s either not sliced  or the biggest slice of pizza in the world i go back in again and find an employee and ask to have it sliced again this request was met with utter confusion and finally they found someone who could use a pizza slicer i m not sure if this is the training store or they just have crap staff but i would avoid this location nypd execs would be wise to send in some mystery shoppers i think they d learn a lot
i ve been always loyal to amc theatres the movie i was planning to see was sold out at westgate so i decided to drive miles down the street to the park west when i went to buy the ticket s the salesperson did nt even look at me when i went to buy a pretzel at the consession stand i said thank you and the worker just gave this stingy look the only good thing about the theater is that seat s are comfortable
terrible service arrived at pm plenty of seating sat inside for ten minutes with no service moved outside and sat minutes with no service waiter was aware he had customers just did nt care told the manager and she feigned surprise but did nt do anything about it she was sitting at a table with three other employees gabbing i suppose her conversation with them meant more to her than serving customers we went next door to steve s and received excellent service and food
my recent visit to chili s was the first time in years a friend had a gift card to burn so she took a few people there i think my taste buds have grown a bit more sophisticated because i found my chicken bacon ranch quesadilla to be quite bland and salty the service was fine but the food was not i was reminded why i usually did nt go to large chain restaurants there are some decent even good ones but chili s is not one of them i could have made a better quesadilla at home
i truly anticipated that barrio queen would become one of my favorite restaurants upon walking in awesome decor and concept with the taco menu resembling a sushi menu where you mark off which you d like to try then we met the waitress  it all went downhill from there just the thought of this place makes me sick now i ordered a martini  after tasting it my entire table of avid tequila drinkers decided that there was tequila in it no big deal we ll just order another one right  wrong the waitress was so rude and sarcastic stating that there was no tequila in it in fact she made it herself okay  ordered a round of tacos they were fine nothing inspiring ordered tableside guac they did nt make it tableside for us but they did for a nearby table chips way too greasy we were still hungry so we ordered chicken enchiladas they were cold disgusting and here s the kicker i found a long dark hair right in the middle vom we were clearly done at that point and when we politely showed the waitress the hair she says that s so weird i do nt think there s anyone who even works here with long dark hair hahahahaha at a mexican restaurant   cue different employees walking by our table with long dark hair before we leave  laughable she did nt apologize or comp anything for us had she done that i might have tried barrio queen again and given it a second chance but since the service was so incredibly poor and the food totally subpar i wo nt ever waste my time again if you want amazing mexican food try la hacienda at the princess or the mission
i needed to have some pretty extensive work done in my backyard including oleander removal followed by all new landscaping in those areas i contacted treeline design on april th jeff came out april th to take a look he said he d get back to me in a few days with an estimate after a couple of weeks i had nt heard anything on may th after i had already had someone else do the oleander removal i called the treeline office lrb spoke to tricia rrb to ask whether jeff still worked there as i had nt heard anything i explained i still was interested in the new landscaping in a show of poor customer service all tricia did was send jeff an email lrb in all caps rrb copying me asking for him to call me well not surprisingly i have nt heard a thing lrb it s now june th nearly two months after the initial consultation rrb i m working with some other companies and treeline has certainly lost any chance for a k  project
i wish i had read the reviews ahead of time about being upsold insurance you did nt want because that s exactly what happened to us i complained when we returned the car and of course they refused to take it off in years of renting cars i have always declined the insurance and that s exactly what i thought i had done on monday jan but dollar is apparently making too much money on the insurance to hear you when you say decline i will never do business with them again
pattie s i do nt get it
we were greeted at the door by two lovely ladies the place was not busy yet they said that it would be a min wait to be seated out side so we took the first available minutes later after i spoke to the bartender and asked him why the wait for a table outside was minutes yet no one is here we were seated food options seemed interesting but not for the price atmosphere is great if u want a quiet spot wait to go to this place when construction is done in downtown because they are building a tilted kilt pub upstairs and it was nosier then the people eating dinner if u are a very wealthy person lrb your salary is more then by yourself rrb u will be able to afford eating and drinking here
horrible customer service they lost cds i returned and are trying to charge me dollars avoid this library
i was browsing on targetcom and decided to buy some items the items that i was purchasing were shoes and clothes i figured if they didnt work out i could return them in the store that is what it said on their home page in bold print after the long processs of checking out i saw that i could use paypal i thought great that will be easy they have all my info well when the items arrived they were ill fitting and poor quality no problem i can rerurn them so i thought since i paid with pay pal they are only able to give me a gift card i am so angry and disappointed i just want a refund the same way i paid i do not want a gift card
i purchased a small case for my compact camera from ritz camera days ago after limited use over that two week period the lowepro brand case had the stitching ripping out of one of the pieces of velcro  probably a manufacturing defect that i was not upset about at all i took the item back into ritz with the receipt and they prompted to tell me they would not exchange the item without all its original packaging which i did not keep i asked to speak with the manager did nt catch a name but he had a long brown pony tail and he proceeded to tell me the same thing and continued that he would take the item back but he would have to charge me a  restocking fee the ridiculous part was that i was actually going to purchase another item at the store at the same time and proceeded to tell him that i would not be buying that item nor anything else again at a ritz camera ever again my suggestion is to bring your business to any other local retail camera seller and avoid ritz camera otherwise you will probably end up paying more than other retailers and getting absolutely horrible customer service if anything goes wrong
omg mold mold everywhere i bought two potato filled pastry s we get  through eating them and my boyfriend goes is that mold we then pick the pastry shell apart and the entire thing is filled with thick black mold this was hours after they were purchased in about an hour we were both feeling sick i threw up which was terrible i m posting a picture of the nasty moldy food we got i m shocked i eat out everyday and have never ever had an experience like this i ordered borsch off the menu as well and they were out so he just opened a can they had on the shelf and added tap water lrb for rrb i have to say one word horrified
this place is a joke there is nothing resort like about it the organization has been pathetic the rooms are less than impressive and you are by nothing interesting do nt waste your time save your money up and go to your local holidays inn cause it is no different anybody that even for a second considers buying a time share here is off their rocker
husband and i decided to try it out very disappointed the bread was really dry and very bready lacked flavor i d rather drive to ted s hotdogs than go back very disappointed
if i could give it zero stars i would worst service i have ever had at a restaurant in my entire years of life i was with a large group of people and we ordered some beers and food lrb coming to an oyster house and being told they do nt recommend them on the half shell rrb and when we got our food the waiter got our order completely wrong and when we told her what happened instead of apologizing and offering to make it right she proceeded to tell us that was what we had ordered and that we were the ones who were wrong i could nt believe my ears when i politely told her again that was not what we had ordered she kept arguing with us and then just took the food and left i was beside myself i have never been treated so badly in a restaurant before i then asked to speak to a supervisor and she shot back that there was not a supervisor on that night yeah i believe that so we promptly left and were never not once offered one single apology instead we were told that we were wrong and then ignored will never set foot in this establishment again and i hope to speak with the owner to let himher know the level of wait staff they have representing their restaurant
wow pei wei used to be one of my favorite places to eat since then prices have gone up and quality has gone way down my friend accurately described the food as tasting like soap i literally could nt finish my meal because it tasted gross and i was nt totally sure the chicken was thoroughly cooked on top of that the staff is very depressing and unfriendly ca nt wait for this place to close and be replaced with a good restaurant
my bf was visting from colorado springs and we were in the mood for seafood yeah in phoenix but we decided to try this place anyway what were we thinking  there was nothing wrong with service the food was terrible it s definitely not what you expect when you look the price really pricey we shared oysters for the appetizer i ordered a clam chowder it was fine not outstanding but edible my bf ordered a ceasar salad the plate was warm the romaine was wilted he is not a picky person but he did not hesitate to send it back i ordered the scallops which were ok a little on the rubbery side and it came with brown risotto it was all too dry i had to get an extra glass of water to wash it all down it sat like a lump in my stomach leaving no room for desert my bf chose the mussels in an herb de provance soup it was a bunch mussles that looked like they were swimming in yellow water the taste  none it was tasteless and watered down no butter no white wine nothing to make it taste good the herbs did nothing for the dish would i go back to give it a second chance nah not for the price the most unsatisfying place i have ever eaten
my wife and i went for early dinner and found the place to be extremely noisy not from people but the crap music was way too loud the meal was for two burgers fries and sodas way too expensive for what you get the burgers were sooo greasy my wife would not eat hers the fries are fake potatoes and the soda machine was broke so we had warm can soday to add to the ice which diluted it very quickly for half the price we can go to in and out and get a really good meal without the grease and the noise we wo nt be back that is for sure
got food poisoning here a few years ago so i do nt have the stomach to go back really loved their food and the people were friendly probably just a fluke but i ended up in the doctor s office and lost lbs
wow crapo we have gone to other tgi fridays in the past and had a much better experience stopped in here on our way back from a weekend trip tried to go to a neighboring restaurant but did not want to wait minutes low and behold we were able to get right in at tgif i guess that should have been our first red flag we were seated right away and our server took drink orders and apps order we ordered the green bean fries  these were pretty good but not as good as the ones at pf changs i ordered the dragon fire salmon which comes with rice pilaf and broccoli my wife ordered the tgif shrimp which comes with fries and all you can eat shrimp when our meals arrived my plate looked like a garbage pile you know like when you watch a cooking show and they keep throwing the scraps onto a pile somewhere on the side well that was my plate a messy pile up of rice broccoli and salmon what a mess i had to deconstruct the pile of garbage before i could begin eating when the waitress asked how it was and i told her the truth she seemed to not really care at all then the manager was making the buttkissing rounds and asked how things were i repeated my minor complaint to her and she just sort of shrugged and said thanks while she walked away messy presentation aside the salmon was pretty good the rest was ok my wife s meal was nothing special and she practically had to beg for the refill of shrimp worst part though was the waitress her name was stephanie very inattentive to customers took eons for her to notice we needed drink refills took forever to get the bill as well next booth over was luckier  they had a server named jessica and she was super attentive and made me feel jealous that i was not seated in her section overall we will never eat here again no way no how
avoid this place i have always gone out of my way to be nice to all the people who work here and in return have gotten nothing but unfriendly catty rude disrespectful witches with attitude in return who do a sloppy job
victoria secret tempe market place sucks if you hurt your self there they do nt care they care more about selling you bras rather than asking and see if you are ok instead of are you ok  can i order you bra online  ah hello i can order my own bra online i made a complaint already times people nobody called me i guess nobody gives a shit z
yuck this was the worst pho i have ever had bad broth ugly meat wilted veggies service was awful the dude up front was coughing violently and blowing his nose go to khai hoan i feel sick right now and may have food poisoning   update i definitely got food poisoning from pho all seasons 
three of us came and went if you are a fan of an overtly pretentious environment than this is your place the staff has no personality and the food even less if you have any concerns  or allergies for that matter  the chef is unable to accommodate the menu is so bold  offering a robust basic items  that they are unwilling to offer no substitutions or modifications really do nt waste your time  or money for that matter  really
the food is too expensive the portions are nt very good for the price across the street is panda express which is about the same amount of food cheaper and has a drivethru the gentleman at the front counter that takes orders at the register had a cup in his hand taking a sip of his drink while taking my order then he proceeded to say hello to a customer i assume is a regular and threw something at him it was all very unprofessional to say the least all while taking my order needless to say i wo nt be coming back
the mortgage loan officer appeared nice in person but never got back to me about my application only after i bugged her by emails a few times then she finally replied and made me fill out another loan application saying previous one is out dated do they not know filling out those extensive application form and gathering all financial information takes time  and after all this stupidity she was nt able to help me i hate it when incompetent people waste my time yeah big banks are good when they are shoving into our faces useless services like over the top online webpage fancy atm machines and unnecessarily numerous brunches lrb like one every block waste of our money really rrb but when we need a real help like their core financial services ie loan services lrb mortgage auto etc rrb they really are not there to help you i was very disappointed with how i was treated i actually pulled all my money out of bofa and moved it to a credit union it probably made no difference to them but i just wanted to make a point
please make stars an option yelp avoid bob and steve at the thomasth st location at all costs got suckered into a serta perfect sleeper here and within a month the nearly bed was sagging we did nt want to deal with it and are moving and called bedmart about the warranty weeks ago they looked up our file and said that an inspector would be in touch to set up an appointment to inspect the bed i waited a week and called back but they said not to worry i called a week later and they said they would look into it called again and they said they d look into it again but go no return call finally i called again today for the th time and steve told me there was no way it would happen until next year lrb after we move rrb that s annoying and bad service sure but the reason i m writing this is that they were patronizing rude and just plain insulting when i said i was dissatisfied at having to wait a month after we move just for the initial appointment steve spoke to me like he was doing me a favor to look into why we had not been contacted in fact he actually said this he was vague about the whole thing and when i asked a question about it he actually said he could fax my request to the factory today or throw it in the trash btw the manager bob said the factory is actually closed so faxing it was not a favor at all either way are they really doing me a favor to follow up on the bad service for the crappy product they sell  no i called back and asked to speak to the store manager who answered the phone and identified himself as bob without even giving me a chance to say hello he gruffly said he had heard the whole conversation and was not going to allow abuse i explained that i was the abused one and that unless i had been on speaker phone he had only heard one side of the conversation he did not like facts and was even more rude after i pointed this out needless to say he clearly did not care about customer service talked over me and cut me off and spoke to me like he was donald trump and i was his peon contestant he proceeded to tell me that there would be no inspection anytime soon since the serta factory was closed until the new year but he offered a hollow favor if i wanted he would call me monday xmas eve umm hello but you just told me the factory who sets up the inspection appointments is closed for days so what new information would you have in days  bob did not want to be bothered with facts and just wanted to shove it to me whether it made sense or not so he kept repeating and belaboring this when does the factory open i asked  but bob who either made up the whole thing about the closure or knew only half the facts or just wanted to keep shoving it to me would nt tell me when do you want me to call you back since you want everything on your schedule he asked how about right when the factory reopens how about we just have them call you to set up the appointment he said um but i already did that weeks ago and they did nt set it up i pointed out lrb that s why i called times rrb whenever the factory opens the next day would be fine i said then bob decided even though i told him this would not work he would not follow up on why they had nt called and just start over in other words throw the followup request in the trash no i said i do nt want that that s what i m doing and then hung up on me we went to bedmart looking for a latex mattress that was firm but bed mart on ththomas convinced us that this spring bed would be great and would not sag they lied then we call about the warranty because the bed is crap and they know it we do nt hear from them repeatedly someone else at the ththomas location was supposed to follow up with me two days ago but never did lrb on my rd call rrb clearly they want to get a bed sold period if you have a problem which eventually you will they will tell you it is someone else fault not return calls patronizingly tell you that they are doing you a favor to follow up on your lack of service and basically treat you like you are crap because you have a problem with the bed to top it all off they will hang up on you and be rude stay away from this location from bedmart generally and from bob and steve
i know corporate reads the yelp reviews since i ve now received two rounds of gift cards from them so i ll spare a stamp and tell them what i think while sparing them two more gift certificates lrb i m not using the last two because i do nt think it would be ethical rrb so here goes i believe my issues with the new concept are structural and not related to the strength of the menu items i say that because the last letter i received told me about a new steak sandwich and lo mein dish for chain restaurants it s a game of expectations and until now when i saw pei wei i always knew what to expect it s consistently decent and delightfully predictable which is why people go to chain restaurants in the first place i ve always liked pei wei and i still enjoy visiting them when i have the chance which is not too often now that i do nt have one anywhere near my house i ll drive miles to patronize true food kitchen or fez but i wo nt drive that far for more basic fare your company did the right thing when it did nt name pei wei pf chang s asian market since it would be a little confusing and make people think they were getting a cheapened experience at the cheaper restaurant i never felt that way about pei wei and thought it stood well on its own the new stores should have their own identity and definitely should not have replaced an existing restaurant which always seemed to be crowded i highly encourage you not to replace any more restaurants with one of these stores but i see that the plan is to replace quite a few of your underperforming stores with these things i really really find eating out of cheap plastic containers to be a serious step down from what i expect from eating at pei wei which seem reasonably elegant for the price point the new store feels too much like eating at mcdonalds and i have nt darkened the door of a mcdonald s level restaurant in years and i ca nt imagine you want to cheapen the pei wei brand in that way if you put this restaurant in an airport then i might eat there but it will no longer be on my fairly large circuit of dining choices good luck in fixing this new concept
i moved here about months ago i took out our mortgage with wf and they opened checkiing and one savings account for me and i was told i would not have any fees associated with this account since that time i have had to reopen all accounts because of some sort of breach in online banking and now have been receiving charges for the accounts when checking in to it they are going to start charging me for no particular reason in order to get my free checking i had to open new accounts to replace one of the accounts and jerry rig transactions per month to go back and forth between accounts in order to do this of course that means new checks fees for this etc now i log on to my account to find that i have no access to any of my accounts for past statements even the ones that did not change when i called the rep acted like i should know this they are a very unreasonable bank to deal with when i find another bank i will be moving on
   this review is for the weekday lunch buffet    ok the old hotel san carlos here is serving a weekday lunch buffet so of course i stopped in to try it today was mexican food day  they had a small setup of items which might be ok as long as the food is good i started with some of what they said was tortilla soup in a styrofoam bowl next there was a bit of salad  then it was on to the refried beans which were cold tasteless  the consistency of the clay we had back in grade school they also featured nearly tasteless chimichangas enchiladas  tacos over at my table there was a pitcher of warm water to drink the service was awful  so was most of the food factoring in price lrb rrb it was worse than taco bite  o
attended a concert at gcu arena in dec terrible parking access  getting in was no problem but getting out was an absolute mess not nearly enough exits to empty the lot in a reasonable amount of time nobody directing traffic either on campus or to exit onto the street very annoying and dangerous terrible seating  the seats are tiny tiny tiny i m a little taller than average and could nt fit in the seat with people seated around me  had to go find an empty seat near the back without anyone in the surrounding seats once was enough i wo nt be going back
terrible experience not like the stores the corporate heads have lost touch with the customers never experience corporate till now i sent back items which were not what i ordered and received a note saying that they have been retagged did not know what this was until they explained it to me as i have bought thousands of dollars from them and referred many friends who have done the same i was stunned as i got shifted around to corporate management who have lost touch with the customer experience it became apparent that they did not want to help but make excuses for their mistake and put blame on me what i did find from the managers who are friends at the stores that i did shop at was that this is happening more lately and she heard that they need to move slow inventory to reduce inventory hence tagging items incorrectly and then sending them out when you try to return them they blantantly blame you for shady practices and if you make waves they ask you not to shop at their store this way they can get rid of you without having to replace anything hence move inventory that they ca nt sell and financial books look good i am appalled at this experience with on line and corporate if you want to move slow inventory put it on sale or donate it do nt make me pay for something i do nt want be wary of ordering on line also make sure you check the quality of what you buy with jeans check the alignment of the back pockets since most are crooked and shirts check the seams also since misaligned you are paying a higher price so expect higher quality and top notched customer service also i would recommend nordstroms they have the same price products sometimes cheaper with better quality and exceptional customer service and return policy they stand by what they sell
it s hard to review food when the cleaning chemicals are so strong you ca nt eat the section i was seated in was being cleaned with strong disinfectant i was asked to move my feet so they could clean the floor under my table but they swabbed my feet too i was here for food not a shoe swabbing well i got sick from the disinfectant paid for my food and left yep they make you too sick to eat then charge you for food that has nt been delivered so i ca nt comment on the food but the cleaning products stunk and left stains on my shoes not really the experience i was looking for
i was excited to try this place out especially because i m all about mom n pop type places its also down the street from my office so i was hoping to find a great new lunch place first time i went with a coworker the restaurant was open but you wouldnt have been able to tell from the inside it was darker than a night club inside and they were nt ready to serve only but a few things off the menu the poor waitress was inexperienced and surprisingly had very little knowledge of cuban food and had to keep running to the back to ask questions we decided to leave and try somewhere else and maybe come back when they were more established i ended up coming back a few weeks later with another friend and tried the buffet and was less than impressed pretty much typical buffet  a bunch of mediocre food with little flavor the fried food that should have been light and hot was cold and greasy my dreams of yummy sweet and slightly salted tostones were crushed because of course they didnt serve them on the buffet lrb really  rrb and again the place was still not prepared to service patrons we had to ask for place settings and there were several dishes with no serving spoons lrb i was nt sure if they wanted you to use the same spoon for multiple items but um no thanks rrb the one thing that was actually good were the black beans  nice smoky flavor but unfortunately for me that s probably the last item when i think of cuban food i actually really care about too bad there s not much that s sweet about azucar
one word comes to mind ish ordered the pu pu platter do nt bother way too much money no dipping sauce lrb unless you ask rrb and the shrimp well i have no i idea what was in that formation i ordered a beef dish that was so dry i had to dump chili paste and soy sauce on it to wash it down with the overly dry rice my friend ordered the sweet and sour chicken same thing very little sauce i will never eat here again
never going back what do you mean no more dutch baby pancake  we drove over miles to go to one of our favorite breakfast places  as a treat we always order the dutch baby pancake after waiting minutes for a table we brushed off by the waitress after asking to order this butterfield s special oh we do nt serve that anymore we were so shocked that we thought she was kidding after going back  forth we kept asking why  she just left  sent over the asst manager he simply stated they were constantly getting burned  made a management decision to discontinue the butterfield s tradition for christ sake they have a half page write up in the arizona republic boasting about their specialized dutch baby pancakes when we stated we d never had a burnt one nor had we ever remembered having to wait any extraordinary time for the cooks to make another one always within minutes of ordering we would get it without fanfare this asst mgr was so indifferent to our complaint that one of my kids said i guess we ll have to go to the original pancake house to get this pancake then the asst mgr piped up  shot down this comment by saying oh but their food is terrible  i ve heard very unclean i was stunned neither my wife or i could think of anything to say to that  the asst mgr then turned  left i can not believe a professional restaurant manager would stoop to such tactics we ve been to the original pancake house  love their food especially their swedish pancakes the dutch baby is a bit better at butterfield s but to have the audacity to speak of another competitor restaurant as being unclean is unforgiveable we never found this restaurant in any less than stellar cleanliness i m sure the original pancake house would not be very happy to hear of this assistant manager slandering their restaurant upon leaving we asked the hostess just when was the dutch baby pancake discontinued  she immediately went  got the general manager he was of little additional help other than clarifying  contradicting his own asst manager he said the pancake was taken off the menu just days prior to us coming when we said that we heard this was because the dutch baby s were getting burned  waste we said maybe you need to get a good cook he looked at us puzzled  said they were nt burned it just takes too long to make what  needless to say i won t be back
i thought that i might have found a replacement for discount tire these guys were really close to my house sold tires and did oil changes so my daughter s car needed a front end alignment why not try them i looked online and called the number as it said i could make an appointment nice um no called them and they said that they do nt take appointments mmmm k so i asked how much an alignment was and they said cool great price so i have my daughter drop her car off when i pick it up for the alignment i paid i do nt quibble about ten bucks but i wo nt go back dishonesty may have gotten them ten washingtons but it lost them my business forever discount tire has yet to be beat as far as i am concerned and it s too bad
i was here a few days ago to pick up some coffee and the arizona burro i went through the drivethru and there were tons of flies flying in and out of the open drivethru window lrb and into my car as well rrb and landing in the open peanut butter container i could see having flies everywhere is not a good sign of cleanliness at all this is awful
booo hiss hate waited in line att their insistence for a very long time just to be told they could nt help me taking seconds to answer my question would have saved the time but worry not there is plenty of time to set up photo enforcement and the like rude people dirty place clean it up and save some face
i have never been so angry to pay my bill before my lovely experience at the garcias s in arizona mills i love mexican food so it was no question that when my boyfriend and i were browsing through our selections at the mall we decided on garcia s upon entrance the staff was very unwelcoming and standard we were seated and immediately asked our drink orders within minutes the chips and salsa and bean dip were deliveredwhich was the best part of the meal our waitress took way too long to take our orders and when we finally received our food lrb i had chicken enchiladas with rice and beans and my boy had a chimi rrb we were nt impressed our meal lacked flavor i know that garcia s is nt authentic mexicansuper yummy hole in the wallmom and pop shopsorta authentic but still i expected something better than the bland flavorless garbage that was steaming in front of me it was crap and overpriced the bean dip was the best part of my meal even the salsa tasted like it came out of a pace bottle crapalicious
if i could give minus stars i would the service there is the absolute worst now i am in the middle of packing to move to portland but i am taking the time out to write this review because this is how bad this place is i have been to mrs whites on several occasions and the service has always been pretty crappy but today took the cake breakdown of events call in my order at pm the woman that answered the phone had no business telephone etiquette at all arrive at mrs whites after going through the maze of the light rail and one way traffic i digress that is not their fault anyway i walk in and i am cheerfully greeted by a young lady that is sweeping a woman lrb i am sure the one that answered when i called is on the phone rrb she is on the phone with her boyfriend calling him out for cheating on her using all sorts of profanity while doing so i state that i am there for the to go order and that is it no one says it will be a few more mins or anything now mind you i live on th st  camelback so travel time to mrs whites should have been sufficient time to prepare fried fish mac and cheese and mixed greens of the dishes are cooked already i am sure i wait for about mins when a older gentleman that works there reminds the phone lady that i am waiting for my order i assume she is the cook well phone lady never even started my order she did not start my order until mins after i walked in the door and she was done calling out her boyfriend on the phone in my mins of sitting and waiting there were employees there and the owner was one of them he did not acknowledge me or anything and sat across from me watching tv and then left why does it take close to and hour to make my order with that many people there in the kitchen  my food finally arrives only to be dropped down in front of me no words just nothing so i leave my for my meal as it states on the website since nobody came to take my money bad enough i have to wait for my food but i be da   ed if i will wait for you to come take my money so i left i barely get my foot in the car and phone lady is out the back door saying that i did not pay the total for my meal i said that the website said the meals were she tells me that the price on the site is wrong the meals are now  so i give the extra now why could she have not been that quick with making my food  so save yourself the time and headache of this place it is not worth it i do nt care how many celebrities or what food network show they were on i have been to plenty of famous soul food places in harlem nyc and never would anything like this ever happen if you have a jones for some soul food check out lo lo s in scottsdale the food is basically the same and the service is excellent
this place was absolutely disgusting i read the reviews thinking it might be worth checking out the chicken in my chimichanga was very fatty and had very little flavor my wife s enchiladas were also disgusting they had some weird cheese that looked and tasted like shredded string cheese the salsa was nt too bad but the chips were hard and cold there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant which was very disappointing because we had to wait for a good amount of time to order our food and to get our check overall i will never ever go back or recommended it to anyone we only ate several bites of our food and had to go somewhere else because the food was too disgusting to eat
i tried i really did i really wanted this to be my watch guy for repair and servicing after reading all of the amazing reviews about  the watch repair company i decided to bring in a few of my old watches with the hope of giving them new life i brought in older seiko chronograph that needed a battery cleaning and some scratches buffed out i also brought my skagen world gmt watch that needed a crown replacement battery and cleaning along with my vostokeurope anchar that needed the rotating bezel pin replaced or fixed lrb to keep the bezel from falling off rrb i was certain this was going to be the beginning of a wonderful business relationship after all the owner is russian one of my watches is russian and i even spent some time in russia so i knew a little about russian watches and culture gosh this would be great i thought boy was i wrong strike one after dropping off the seiko and skagen for what i thought would be a pretty quick fix and clean up lrb the owner tells me this rrb i get a call a week later stating that the seiko is ready but he would need more time to fix the crown on the skagen ok sure let me know when it is ready no worries right  i m not in that desperate of a rush to get the watches back i can wait about five days after that he calls me to inform me that the skagen is ready with the seiko for pickup bring cash i do nt take visa sure no problem his business his rules i get it well i pick up the seiko and skagen to see that yes they are fixed but he did not clean or polish them at all and they were both really dirty still maybe he just got busy and forgot  anyway while i m waiting to pick them up there were also several other people lrb shady looking folks selling gold and selling it fast rrb making deals with him so i felt like mentioning it my cleaning problem would not have not warranted a good response at that moment so i figured i would mention it another time or just clean them myself as i am more than capable no biggie strike two a few days later i i decide to give him another go as he mentioned to me that he was an expert in russian watches so in good faith lrb once again rrb i bring him my vostokeurope anchar and ask him to fix the bezel he gives me a range for a price and so i drop it off he was nt sure if he had the parts and said he may have to send it to a friend to get it fixed ok just let me know when it s ready a couple days later he calls me to tell me that maybe i need to call the distributer lrb only a couple in the u s rrb and have the parts paid for and shipped out here so he can fix it so to recap a russian watch expert who is now asking me to do the leg work and get the parts needed to repair the watch hmmm at this point i decide not to invest any more time into this as i can now see where this whole thing is going i decline politely opting to send the watch to ri for repair instead strike three a few days after the vostok fiasco i somehow rationalize with myself that the reason he could nt fix it was because of the rarity of the watch itself and that i should just stick to easier repairs for him man i m trying so hard to give this guy my business it is unreal  this what i was thinking at this point i give him a call and ask about crystal replacement for my skagen why not  surely he s got this under control right  yes bring it in i replace with same crystal cash great see you thursday not so great when i visit him though he takes one look at it and tells me he can not fix it because the crystal is too big mind you he had an extensive amount of time with this watch lrb i presume rrb because he had it for close to two weeks when he repaired it the first time ugh here is the deal i am patience to my own detriment sometimes i am aware of this therefore sometimes i get treated a little poorer by businesses that think i wo nt do or say anything i get it but i really wanted this to by my watch guy and i was trying so hard to give him my business even after he fell through twice on his end what else could i do  here is my actual evaluation of his operation got a quartz watch in need of battery  see this guy got anything of value that you want back in a specific time frame  go to an ad got a watch over with repairs needed  go to another shop or send it off to an ad or highly recommended place got gold for sell  see this guy for quick cash lrb it seemed like a popular choice when i was there rrb sorry i tried guess i ll have to take my business elsewhere one other quick note the whole desperate people selling gold and only dealing in cash made me think that this guy s operation of watch repair may be a front for his other dealings not saying i care just saying it came across like that to me as i was waiting for my watches
cobbler fraud ok your calling yourself a cobbler shop lrb and who does that rrb yet your admitting to me that your peaches are not fresh but hey it tastes like it does huh i m glad that i just asked for a taste of the cobbler to avoid getting more riled up and then luckily asked the nice lady about her peaches how cheap are some places and then it was obvious the sample had been nuked because it was microwave hot and not fresh out of the oven then i m thinking hmmm i never had a frozen apple before the apple cobbler must be fresh right  apples are like cents each but to my horror those apples are also canned frozen or otherwise not fresh all of this could have been avoided if i never stepped foot in the place and just stared at the sign karim does nt make cobbler grandma does karim just thinks he can call himself whatever he wants  oh its cobbler allright but granny would be rolling over in her grave at these frozen canned and nuked frauds
received flyer today in mail crazy buffet advertised no cholesterol it was near a picture of crab legs and oysters if referring to this seafood both contain cholesterol if the advertisement was about their restaurant that is also false do nt make ridiculous health claims
hi there i lived in this apartment complex for a year and i was very relieved when my lease ended i lived in phase i do nt have any knowledge on when this phase was actually constructed but it certainly looked and felt like the oldest phase in the complex i ll start with the positive there was ample parking lrb both covered and uncovered rrb and we had new carpet when we moved in the rent was very reasonable brandon in the office was very amicable and polite and seemed genuinely concerned about our experience that s it for the positive on to the negative the apartment itself was poorly painted and constructed quite honestly it looked like they sent trained monkey s in with paintbrushes and hammers and told them to do the job as fast as possible the cabinets were plywood that had been painted many many times they had a funny smell to them like years and years of grease and cooked food accumlated upon move in we discovered that the apartment truly was nt move in ready rrb upon checking the dish washer a loose piece of dry wall fell off the wall adjacent rrb the dryer exhaust was not hooked up and was the torn holy exhaust tube was sitting on the top shelf of the closet rrb the baseboards at the bottom of the walls were not there it s simply unpainted cracked walls that come to a right angle with our carpet quite ugly rrb multiple door locks were broken rrb some of the shelves in the fridge were broken and dangling that s just what i can rememeber from a year ago i m positive there was more but i truly ca nt recollect i did enjoy balcony but the problem is that we overlooked a very very large and dead tree no attempt was made at removal it simply sat there looking very unattractive we had cockroaches for several monthes despite having a neat and clean apartment we were told it was from the downstairs neighbors they sprayed our apartment multiple times but nothing was done to rectify the situation at the source lrb the downstairs neightobrs rrb until they actually moved out management sprayed and declared the building roach free then we had some new downstairs neighbors move in and after talking to them i ve found out that there were still cockroaches infesting the downstairs and by proxy our upstairs gross the pool in phase was poorly maintained to the point where it was almost unusable wrong chemical mixes that irritate the skin and poor sanitary conditions in and around the pool areas add to the feeling that there is a distinct lack of caring or concern about the safety and welfare of the tenants the hot tub did not work at all the entire year we lived there noise levels were consistently loud but did die down a bit toward the end of the lease although we still did get the occasional gangster wannabe rolling around with his bass turned all the way up the real source of noise came from the gang of twenty or thirty kids lrb ages  rrb that hung out in the driveway of the phase do be careful coming into the parking lot because they are completley oblivious that they are playing in the road i feel that most of the issues could have been resolved by management but they seem to be dealing with a lot of red tape from their corporate office  i was told that for many of my complaints they would have to get approval from their corporate office to remedy my complaints i m sure the economy was nt really helping the situation either i did get very frustrated with management many times lrb in particular when our ceiling in the master bedroom started leaking at am rrb and i m not sure if they re simply used to lots of calls coming in for maintenance issues but i certainly felt like we were a tertiary concern for them if you do decide to give laguna village a try i would advise caution make sure that you find out which apartment you re going to be in so you can scout out the area before moving in make sure you look at the interior of the apartment before moving in so you can take advantage of the clause in your lease allowing you days to move out if it is unsatisfactory do nt assume that because the apartment they will show you as an example apartment is fantastic inside and out that the unit you will be given will be even close to what they ve shown you if you have a choice choose to live in phase or best of luck to you
read the reviews and went to the hidden gem for dinner tonight lrb saturday night rrb and it was dark either temporarily or permanently closed call before you spend the effort
early board  we are huge fans of sw and have flown them for years our holiday flight from long island to phoenix left us less than pleased we paid for early boarding when we printed out our boarding passes our numbers leaving islip were in the s and our numbers leaving chicago were in the s when i called sw after receiving the high numbers i was told that eb passengers got their boarding numbers hours prior to departure while everyone else got their numbers hours ahead while waiting in line to board both on long island and chicago we talked to passengers ahead and behind us and discovered that in both cases those passengers did not buy the eb program so we paid for early board but obviously did not get early boarding
short version it looks like it was either a failed texas roadhouse or a very cheap knock off either way norterra has plenty more to offer without suffering here food is on a fast food level all frozen friedmicrowaved if it was nt for the service i would have given it maybe a however my overall experience was just terrible waitress and manager were clueless it took more than mins from the time we gave our credit cards till the time we actually signed the check no appology no comps manager seemed pissed that i would complain about being over charged and made us wait while they kept our cards long version our waitress was very friendly and pleasant we asked about hh drinks specially the wine now this is nt a place to go for fine wine we realize that but when we asked which wines were on hh we were told by our waitress that she did nt drink and did nt know the wines or how to pronounce them or which one was on hh so we decided to back track and order a bogo vodka and soda and lime that confused our ttotaller for a minute we placed out order appetizers our first round of drinks came quick then nothing for about  minutes which is painful when you are left with a bucket of salted peanuts finally i was able to order a another round of drinks vodka and peach tea meanwhile we watched a everyone else get their main courses while we waited for our appetizers for another  minutes so we are now nearly minutes since entering the place finally our appetizers arrived via other servers again our waitress was gone elsewhere we ate our appetizers which were soso nothing special and not worth the calories and fat we received our check and i had been charged for teas so we questioned this and the waitress said it was a mistake she would fix it we gave her cards to split the bill minutes later we flagged down the manager who said he would get this resolved he promptly brought us a new check hang on wheres our credit cards we gave over minutes ago he went and found the waitress she presented us with a split bill finally but did nt take the tea off so i hunted for the manager and explained the mistake he said he would take care of it now nearly minutes had gone by and he presents me with one half of the bill and removed the tea  now i tried to explain that the folder i gave back to him had slips in it to half the bill and he needed to redo the bill with the tea deducted the manager was clueless finally brought us two checks but only one had the removed by this time we were so worn out and happy to see our cards back it was minutes since we handed them over that we paid left a just tip for the service and left wondering what all the attraction was about no appology no comps manager seemed pissed that i would complain about being over charged and made us wait while they kept our cards
first time try the service and would not go back sloppy job on manicure and cracking jokes about my private life for first time they ever met me was inappropricate i ve experienced better service
been to the majerle s in phoenix but this review is for the new place in chandler  as i ca nt remember the last time i visited the downtown estab the bottom line avoid like the plague a couple observations  the place was total sausage fest like dudes to one girl during happy hour  worst fish and chips imaginable now what place on earth serves up cookieencrusted greasesoaked cod with sugarlaced french fries  yuck  the tartar sauce to go with that  nope just all mayo  hot wings surprisingly we re okay  philly cheesesteak sandwich  ick  cole slaw more like sugar slaw place blows so many other great places in the east valley to visit with your hard earned dollar vote elsewhere

walked into jimmy john s at pm on  to see a man with a large dog waiting for food at the pickup end of the counter the dog was not a seeing eye dog or one in training dog had its front feet up on the counter and the people behind the counter were talking to the dog pretty disgusting for food being prepared or feet away no thanks

the owner of this store is extremely rude and unhelpful i will never ship here again or refer anyone to this store i have never been treated so poorly by anyone that owns a business in my life
i would have given stars but i feel betrayed by the horrible way one of my fav cuisines was handled a philly cheesesteak is a form of chi that no one should fuck with get it right or back off also when you advertise a lemon coke as a dinner make sure it s not coke with a lemon slice in it that is false advertising
awful this place is packed if you want to get into a movie you have to show up at least an hour and a half before the seating is awful bench table with office chairs the food is expensive and disgusting if you want a great movie dine in experience go to the amc esplanade
asu fans are mean i actually cheer for usc over asu there i said it usc you dont feel welcome in their town after football games thats really bad pr
considering what is considered the  norm for workout facilities this place is way behind the times this place would be amazing for  it would then be considered clean tidy and cutting edge there are some actual perks about this place  they do have daycare and plenty of mirrors for me to watch my fat jiggle while i run on the treadmill  rrb it s just an utter disaster when the bf and i originally signed up we got a couples membership at a newly redone glendale location and it was worth the monthly membership fee this place does not need a  facelift it needs to be gutted and totally renovated you just feel a nasty moistness when you walk in the door  which just gets worse the longer you re there and is even more worse during the summer guys always have the weight benches dominated there s never any availability for machines lrb any kind rrb from  pm then it starts to thin out blah bla bla blah bla considering this is the biltmore location huge disappointment fact
very dangerous work there as a merchandise processor for day my body could not handle the horrible working conditions such as broken syringe needles stabbing through our flimsy gloves i would also like to point out that customers go through the garbage before it came to me so i wonder how many people it stabbed all my tests came back negative thank you lord
i have had nothing but poor customer service from brighton takes forever to get anything back that you send in then when i did send my watch in for the battery it only worked for weeks they had it for weeks gave it back to them today so we ll see how long this battery takes
first of all i m out to have a good time on my birthday the id checker told me that my birthday was yesterday even though it was pm on my actual birthday then we get in and the bartender lrb male rrb looks over at the female bartender and goes are you going to get them  to which she rudely replies no you get them everyone was rude from the get go we just went to check them out i give good reviews where ever i go but i felt bombarded with rudeness and hated it we walked out in less than minutes do nt do it
shady shady shady they are crooks they are unorganized unprofessional liars i would nt trust them to manage a property or to attempt to rent a property from them beware
haha at buca yeah you have an array of typical dishes to choose from but considering these are quite simple buca still can not master them thought the chopped salad would be awesome but i should have known they used machetes to chop this dish and then served us the bottom of the bulk which means sweaty liquefied salad also i do nt mind having to order a  side of pasta but i m just so flummoxed by the choices spaghetti with marinara  or fettucine alfredo  choices choices choices i mean these two just pair so well with the porchetta rustica lrb sarcasm rrb apple crostata  standard apple pie no warm apples flaky crust as falsely advertised on the menu i should have learned from my first experience here good as a soup line
i was a hankering some mexican food basic fare ya know well yelp listed mucho taco so why not my first impression walking the through the door was somewhat mixed the tables were all stacked with dirty plates with the exception of one table now one could suppose they had a busy lunch time and the food is good or not i chose to think it was good food and a busy location i placed my order and was provided chips and salsa to snack on while waiting for my meal my dish arrived shortly and the food was ok nothing memorable as i can not even remember what i ordered what does stand out is the counter help was cleaning the tables and the following was observed my first few bites were ok nothing special except for the hair in the salsa bowl maybe a forgone warning i asked for another salsa bowl before my observations noted below as i sat there the counter help was cleaning the tables with a dish rag which we see and most likely do at home right  except the food debris she swept off the table was landing onto the seated benches large chips small chips and whatever else was very noticeable she neither cleaned the benches or attempted to pick up the large food debris from the seated areas the green and red sauce bottles were collected and placed on the servers counter along with what perceivably was a full bowl of salsa as she cleaned the tables other salsa bowls collected from the tables were taken to the kitchen along with the dirty dishes the green and red sauce bottles along with the full bowl of salsa was taken back to the kitchen follow me the full bowl of salsa on the table was most likely placed back into a larger vat for reuse later to other customers if not then why separate this one salsa bowl and place with green and red sauce bottles  so i said all that to say this you gotta be kiddin i wo nt be back
this ups store is beyond ridiculous i sent a package on october th to my parents it arrived smashed into pieces i filed a claim two weeks later and the woman behind the counter said they would handle everything ups insures all packages up to i ve followed up on the phone three times and personally gone into the store three more the second to last time i went in  i waited for minutes while the one worker tried to figure out what she was doing with another customer then another girl appeared  went and rifled through some files and said yep it s here we re just waiting on ups to get back to us fast forward more weeks i went in again and the girl behind the counter could nt even find a record of the shipment luckily i saved the shipping receipt i find it hard to believe that a company as large as ups should take months to review a small claim the biggest part of this ordeal is this particular ups store they do nt appear to have much knowledge beyond selling stamps
just spent over minutes at a table waiting no waitress or waiter however i was able to see up to waitresses and a manager a table over eayupting and chatting while me and my friends waited as we left we told the hostess why we were leaving in front of the manager and he said absolutely nothing food do nt know s drinks do nt know never got either service awful i will spread the word for you manager since you can not talk
you know how your wife or girlfriend is always whining about how you never listen to them  this of course as a shoe comes whistling past your cranium well the tortilla factory must have the same listening skills their management never listens either you would think that after reviews someone over there would recognize there s a problem with the service nope this would lead one to conclude noone in management knows about yelp or and i suspect this is more the case they ca nt read prior to writing this i read some of those reviews in an effort to see how my experience last night pairedup uncannily it was true to form explaining why this place gets two and a half stars service was bad with waiters only stopping by to sell more drinks had to ask for the tortillas twice before ever seeing them appx minutes waiting on the free tortillas hey tf do i need to remind you of your namesake  and the prices for the amazingly tasteless food will stupefy you lrb i sampled everyone s food in our party of eight rrb old town tortilla factory you re really one sneaky bastard laying in wait for all the unsuspecting scottsdale visitors looking for the  mexican food experience and instead ambushing them with your bad service high prices and tasteless garbage you call food but you do have some nice attributes which is why similar to my situation of never listening i still have a wife only i m not sure how a fountain large patio and a cutesy margarita cup are going to keep you in business oh well who cares right  there ll be another plane full of visitors headed your way tomorrow are you related to rustlers roost by any chance  you both have so much in common
sorry not impressed with the pizza greasy could not finish the slice i ordered salad was blah free popcorn had no taste no salt no butter blah not returning
i currently live here and i find it the worst place ever wish i could get out of lease without so many fees i have had numerous problems living in these apartments i should have never moved here i have had my car vandalized i ve had the maintenance department steal my ipod when i was gone and the office staff said their was insufficient evidence when two men employed by camden for maintenance entered my apartment to fix my freezer and then my ipod touch was no longer in my apartment ummm come on how much more evidence do you need  i am so fed up with this place ca nt wait to get outta here they say its safe but they have had theftbreakins so beware when looking at this location they will not tell you these things up front shannon and kirsten will try to sell you on the property but care nothing about your real safety wellbeing or your belongings think twice before deciding to live at this property
this place was messy and loud the food really was nt great and the salsa bar looked like a three year old put it together overall the only plus was the tortilla chips that were free before the food i will not be back unless one of my friends pays for me
this festival sounded like it was going to be amazing unfortunately it was such a bust outside of the parking and entrance fees that literally did nothing but get you into the place you then had to buy tickets to try samples lrb literally one bite samples rrb at each the lines were ridiculous well over an hour for most and most of the trucks had run out of food shortly after it started i wo nt be wasting my time or money on this kind of event again sad
after visiting the glendale store two consecutive days and spending nearly store manager lane pate left me feeling less than satisfied with my experience lane had worked with me both days and was informed that i did not have any furniture in the home i was furnishing yet he neglected to mention that with my bed purchase i would not get a frame after the deal was closed and i inquired about frame set up upon delivery he told me the frame was not included and the mattresses would be laid on the floor he then sent me next door to purchase one from kevin for an additional more dollars i was so shocked i did nt know what to say and just left even kevin laughed and then apologized for making fun of the poor service i am thoroughly disappointed that during our multiple discussions this detail was not mentioned particularly since this is a necessary component my intentions were to come back and purchase furnishings for the rest of my home but based on how i felt when i left today i will most certainly be doing my shopping elsewhere
i was bugging my boyfriend for weeks to take me to this restaurant i am a couponer and had a off expiring on  so he took me tonight we had a pretty nice evening and then they told me the coupon was no good because it was  bottle wine night well the coupons say nothing about being not valid on wednesday s or  bottle wine night it just says you can just use coupon per visit per offer lrb of the coupons on the list rrb i am a woman pf principle and i will never come back to this place again the owner should be embarrased getting people to the restaurant to not accept a little coupon for this alone i would not step foot in this place we were with my best friend who thought it might be nice ot have her rehersal dinner for her upcoming wedding here lrb discussed during the meal rrb but over that is gone at that point it had nothing to do with the but the fact they would stoop that low good luck i will make sure all my boyfriends coworkers lrb in his building alone rrb never step foot in this restaurant and i would bet you it will be closed in  months terrrible service terrible atttitude  terrible restaurant no matter what the food is place is a joke and veryy arrogant wait staff definitely did not treat us good
as a new yorker i m always yearning for a good deli experience in the desert after all my people wandered around one for years you d think we could find a decent nosh anyway this place ai nt it as pathetic as it sounds i still ca nt find anything better than chompies and that s a pretty low bar to cross my wife and i took of our kids lrb oldest at uofa rrb and we were hopeful for a taste of nyc as we had been here for breakfast once before and it was decent our lunch experience was far from it i had the special  a skirt steak sandwich my wife had a half chopped liver sandwich and a cup of soup lrb ca nt recall which one rrb kids had bagels portions were ridiculously small there were strips of steak on my bread my wife had an ice cream scoop of chopped liver bagels were large but nothing special service was prompt but devoid of personality come on if you re gonna work at a deli at least give me a little attitude anyway if you re jonesing for deli avoid this place it wo nt help
good part appeared to be a locals favorite an have a local theme rest of story you stand in line for cafeteria type service you by pass people with heir food already who are hunched over their food like prisoners then you get your drinks and go to the counter i ordered pulled pork and pork ribs with baked beans and mac and cheese the lady behind the counter responded  qu  silly me for only speaking the national language of english after two more tries she finally is able to understand my order so i get my order and i mention they were really light on the sauce she told me not to worry you can get more so we pay then get sit down but wait there is no one to clean up the mess of previous people or trash cans at the end doors to dump your trash so you get to pick up the trash of the previous guests and pile it on the ledges with the rest not sure how that does nt attract other little critters so my girlfriend brings up the bbq sauce as i finish clearing off a place to eat again i was wrong to assume that bbq sauce was supposed to be thick like ketchup and not pour like water now we finally get to eat and the meat was dry and it was obvious the sides were boxedcanned and just warmed up then while trying to supplement the moisture from the drink i ran out so i get to stand in line with the hungry crowd again and walk past all the prisoners guarding their food to refill at the only soft drink station also stick with the barq s root beer the home made tastes like a diet version needless to say in the end i was not impressed at all
i went to crust last night and was very disappointed i ordered the medium crust pizza with spinach as a topping the pizza arrived lukewarm and the spinach had a bitter taste the service was friendly and the ambiance was ok but i think that joe s pizza in downtown scottsdale has a much better sicilian stye of pizza for a much lower price i will not be returning to crust
padlocked and closed with an eviction notice taped to the front door
this place is horrid they profile tattooed people like they are criminals do not go here
ok food horrible service
unbelievable i went here for an ultrasound and transvaginal ultrasound ordered by my obygyno to confirm a pcos diagnosis as my husband and i had been trying for over a year to get pregnant with no luck when i arrived i did the paperwork and sat in the overcrowded waiting room to be called back my husband was meeting me there as well i got called back before he got there i asked the lady at the front to send my husband back once he arrived well the front desk called back to the room i was in and the technician answered the phone and her response was something like yea yea she wants her husband here i do nt understand why and then hung up the phone it took pretty much all i had to keep myself from screaming at this woman i wish i could have calmed myself enough to get her name how effing rude she had noooooo clue what i had been through medically not to mention the trying to conceive part of my medical history how dare you say you do nt understand why i m pretty sure it s none of your damn business and if someone anyone comes into your establishment requiring spousal emotional support do nt question them i ll never use this facility again thankfully we ve moved on to an re who actually performs all my testing in his office and with his own hands
this location was a joke me and my girlfriend went here while we were waiting for her cars oil to be changed at the brake masters down the street you stand in line like at a cafeteria and the people behind the counter dishing out your not so fresh food can barely speak english the tray i picked up was sticky and dirty and had some type of half dried syrup on it and it was disgusting they served us and did not even give us silverware or chopsticks to eat with and the general decor of this restaurant looks like a ghetto chinese buffet in crack central the floors and restaurant in general were dirty like christina aguilara dirty back in the day before she was a mom the food tasted like it had been sitting in a pan for hours and i would never go to this place again i was surprised i did nt find a finger or a needle or a cockroach in my plate of mushroom chicken with vegetables
the pho was not good this place is old and run down
snooty and expensive tiny portions of precious food get real please
went to spotted donkey today and sign says they are closed
this place is disgusting the place looks ok the decor looks fine and everything looks good at the beginning i ordered a carafe of green apple infused sake both me and the friend i was with poured our first little shot when we realized the bottoms must ve been full of dust there was little pieces of lint floating all inside  and the shot glass fits only like a tablespoon at the bottom there was a little brown streak that i wiped out lrb i was not going to ask for another dusty shot glass rrb btw the sake tasted like water and green apple mixer with a touch of sake  it is the weakest drink i ve ever had the carafe which is normally dollars at happy hour poured little teaspoonfuls of sake how do you mess up wasabi and soy sauce  the rolls we ordered came out fine but somehow the soy sauce had like no flavor do they water the soy sauce down  i normally put a lot of wasabi but this is the first time i put the whole pile in and barely got a tingle in my nose oh and i had to wipe down my little place too because there seemed to be old food on it lrb it felt gritty and there was a piece of dried up lettuce on it rrb the table probably was never wiped down because it was sticky as well this place sucks and i would never go there again
people came and went they picked up togo orders paid their bills got on with life they loved had children died were reincarnated as sea creatures i just sat there no menu no water no service i was wearing a shirt and shoes too finally we were the only people left in the restaurant and the servers just started cleaning other tables no menus no waters no acknowledgment of being alive considering i was nt wearing my invisibility cloak i do nt really get what was going on i wo nt go back but if i did they probably would nt even realize i was there  cries under invisibility cloak 
this review is for easytech that s inside staples dropped off my laptop to be diagnosed since it i was getting blue screen and error message related to the operating system informed technician that was getting os message and tested computer came back after three alleged tests that said it was the definitely the motherboard you know in that know it all kinda way asked nd in house technician to test it again and once again came back and said it was motherboard offered to send it off to be refurbished for and told me that they would do everything that was needed called me back nd day to let me know that they could nt refub dell xps laptops with video cards and to get someone to replace the mb you d thing that s something they would know ordered mb and had it installed by another technician and it turned out to be the operating system emailed technician regarding the inaccurate diagnosis and never received a reply morons certainly would nt assume just because they are working on computers that they know what they are talking about got me
just gave another try last night to see if saigon is worth to hold my heart but obviously it is not to be honest i ve tried real authentic vietnamese food so if you try the food and you think it s good  then you have nt tried the real food since they just changed the owner quantity is more matter than quality they just wanted to cook quickly serve quickly to meet the demand and if someone do nt know the real taste then it s their lost last night we had to wait more than mins for the food to come out i ordered pho tai with beef on the side  xtra beef lrb because i d prefer to eat them medium raw rrb and my bowl came out as a big disappointment they did nt use eye round steak as advertising  they used some kinda different beef and it made me wanna vomit right in the first bite i am not talking about the siracha i m not talking about bean sprouts not about any other either  i m talking about the broth i just felt like i ate a bowl of boiling water with some msg my friend ordered mi hoanh thahn lrb egg noodles and wonton rrb  she let me try the broth and both of us agreed that the broth tasted like boil water plus some xtreme fish sauce i m not even try to come back here in a mean while  i can get much more than i expected at other places i just feel bad for those who get deceived by the price and such bc they would never know they can enjoy something better than that sorry saigon but i need to cross your name out of my list
i went through the drive through and ordered burrito and chips and salsa got home and realized i didnt have my burrito i didnt have enough time to go back and come back home again so i got ready for work and then went back on my way to work it had now been about minutes since i was at the drivethru i walked inside this time and explained what had happened the girl didnt seem to care she grabbed a burrito that had been sitting in the corner by the drive thru for this whole time apparently i was hoping for a fresh burrito to take to work not an old one that had been sitting out she said they could charge me for a new burrito i said no thank you i will just take my money back for the one i never got she did give it back but dropped my money on the counter with a little attitute i guess it was my fault they forgot to put my burrito in the bag  went across the street to carambas to pick up lunch instead love carambas
beyond disappointed i have absolutely loved this place in the past this trip has completely taken me by surprise i would write that you should not come to this property if you have children but i am not sure that is the case i brought my daughter and her friends here for a girls getaway we were treated horribly by one of the pool staff as soon as we arrived after a tab lrb which i tipped generously on rrb we decided to go back up to the room for a rest we came back to the pool a little while later  in which as i write this lrb over an hour of being here rrb the lovely server has only come over to tell me that the girls need to be quiet lrb even though there is a very loud group of people on the other side of the pool rrb and has not even offered if we would like something to drink eat etc i am truly embarrassed and disappointed none the less the girls feel like they were nt wanted
went for a free poker tournament and was quite disappointed lrb and disgusted  rrb in the place i literally stuck to the floor it was gross their carpet is nasty the bathroom was nt much better i mean do nt get me wrong i do nt expect a lot from a sports bars but i also do nt expect to stick to the floor the waitress i had was great and the drinks were cheap and strong  but not enough so to bring me back in the future thumbs down
the doctor is very very very old fashioned i had the mariana put in before i moved to michigan and loved it when i was having some issues and cramping lrb since it was my first months of the birth control rrb i decided to visit this doctor to make sure everything was alright needless to say the doctor was appalled that i had this form of birth control and did not have a child she was completely against my decision and made it perfectly clear everything she had to say had a bias
my fiance suggested we go here and though i read all the lousy reviews about this place i figure meh i ll give it a shot well every review you read about the lousy service is true or the one really lousy server gets around slow service and she was absolutely clueless now if she was busy i d chalk it up to being slammed but she was nt took forever to get drinks take our order never brought napkins got the order wrong forgot my salad i could go on and on really horrible and the wings were ok but whoever said great wings was misguided or inexperienced the other food was pretty good but the service just killed it overall so next time you re at cadillac ranch waiting and waiting and waiting for someone to take your drink order look across the courtyard see san felipe  now there is a good place take your appetite and your money leave cadillac ranch and go across the way to that restaurant you ll thank me i promise
the food was meh at best the service was deplorable i ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast first the biscuits came out when they served my fianc his dinner then came the steak and part of the eggs the remain egg and hash browns came out by the time i was served my fianc was nearly finished our waitress left us sitting there long after we had finished eating when i asked for a to go box she took my plate and did nt return for quite a while when she came back she asked if i wanted a box for my biscuits i asked where the rest of my meal was and could see immediately on her face she had thrown it away she then said i thought you only wanted a box for the biscuits which made no sense she then left hurriedly and said she would adjust the bill but i would have gladly paid the extra to leave both she and the manager said that they had nt scheduled a cook and waiters the waitress said she was triple booked at her station i do nt see this as the waitresses issue but it seemed more like a lot of bad management decisions what kind of manager has an all you can eat fish fry on a friday night and does nt have all of his staff working  this was our fist and last visit to bbd
 years or so ago i would come to this mall every once in a while and i do nt remember it being too bad then again i was a college student new to arizona and i may have just been naive the other day i walked in the front door and immediately starting planning how soon i could leave the place just has an overrun flea market atmosphere i noticed a few generic clearance stores and with the virgin megastore going out of business i m sure another one will be taking its place soon enough i stopped by a couple other outlet stores where the prices were not very outlet worthy i should have just stayed away and kept the good memories intact
i called the health dept on this disgusting place and a inspection will be happening soon i also filed a complaint with the bbb as for anyone thinking of eating here i urge you not to if you have any shred of dignity
i ve had waaaay better mexican i grew up across the way from the barrios in santa ana so i know me some good mexican pros  cute outdoor decor that was it  the cheese crisp was ok  they had flour tortilla chips that were pretty tasty and a nice change from corn cons  food was not good i can make better mexican and i m asian  ceviche tasted like frozen shrimp mixed with salsa  drinks were watered down i ordered a margarita and it came with a side tumbler so i was excited until i tasted it watery verdict would not go again although it was fun following the chilies on the path back to my hotel
after reading the reviews we decided to take the family here the mine tour was over priced and horribly boring and a waste of time the mine is fake and the tour guide was awefull the saloon would have been decient if the bartender didnt talk to me my wife and my children and yrs old about politics and religion  how muslims are bad  this was out of the blue this place is horribly boring for anyone any age you would think this fake place the people could get in character and play a part in the atmosphere  cowboys miners instead the people were sad and the place was sad do not go here unless you want to be bored out of your mind
not a big fan they nickel and dime you i ordered the lettuce wraps and they do not serve enough lettuce with the order i asked for one additional piece of iceberg lettuce and they charged me i could have walked to albertson s next door and bought an entire head of lettuce for cents
i had a horrible experience this past week just going in to inquire about prices i was met by a sales personwhatever they are called who began by weighing me and measuring my bmi though i do nt know how they can measure in such a way as they did mind you the only reason i went in was to inquire about pricesnowhere in there did i say i wanted to be weighed measured etc i m normally a runner however have found with starting a new job and the summer heat i m having difficulty finding time to do this outside i was only looking for a facility at which i could use a treadmill and maybe take in a few classes here and there for the next couple months till it cools off enough for me to run outside at a decent hour the salesman treated me like i was some fat lady who had never seen the inside of a gym before without even asking he assumed my lifestyle was sedentary and then proceeded to tell me my bmi was the highest on the chart far beyond what a healthy bmi should be i m not stupid i know my bodyi m not thin but i m not obesei m quite average and i m quite active i took huge offense to this i also told him i would like to lose about lbs and no more and he whipped out another chart saying someone my age and my height is actually supposed to be about lbs less than i am are you freaking kidding me wait it gets better when he finally got around to the pricing lrb hidden startup fees etc rrb i asked him about a couples rate as my boyfriend was interested in joining too he gave me the rates after the shpeel i said thank you very much i m not ready to make the decision at this time and he said he said is your boyfriend keeping you from signing up with me today  i said no he may still join but i think i m going to stick with the y downtown near my house if this is the sales tactic at la fitness they are badly mistakeni left there feeling like crap i have been off the wagon for a month or so and am ready to get back up and at em but i felt like this guy was trying to play on my selfesteem or somethinglike he was actually trying to get me to feel bad about myself so i d sign up for a membership boo la fitness boo indeed because of this experience i will not got back to la fitnessthe salesman surpassed the stereotype i had in mind of sales people at chain gyms like this
horribly slow drive thru takes  minutes on average food is good but not that good
i know that fry s has better prices than safeway but i still hate this chain they never have enough checkouts open its setup is annoying because they have everything scattered around the store making you go down almost every isle to get what you need i know that they do that so you will buy more just gets me pissed and i end up leaving and going to safeway i also ca nt stand all the pan handlers in the parking lot why is it that every time i go to any fry s some jerk has to ram their cart into the side of my truck and no i am not taking up more than one spot and i always park at the back of the parking lot because i enjoy walking
came here while a robbery was in progress the cops asked me why on earth i would have come here alone lrb at pm no less rrb avoid at all costs unless you need more excitement in your life
first time to the mellow mushroom was very excited took over an hour to get the pizza waitressed blamed the amount of people in the restaurant and how busy they were restaurant was maybe  occupancy service was absolutely awful pizza was okay but the service really killed it
the hotel is great and very nice it s a very nice la quinta inn the issue is the hotel double charged me for my stay i spend several hours with the hotel staff and told me stuff i am not sure if the stuff was true i have my doubts i finally dispute my charge with my credit card company as it was not refund i then had to threaten legal action against this specific hotel including cost of going back to yuma for the court case only after that did they refund the money it took almost a month for me to get my money back after they double charged me please note with my credit card activity i can tell when the refund was put through on their side and when it posted so i know it was posted afterwards i have been double charged before by hotels i understand the mistake it happens all the hotels had the charged refund within a day or two of calling not a month and not having to threaten legal action i do nt known if i would stay here again it s nice but i would never give them my credit card again in all honesty i am not sure if i would stay at another la quinta agian
having to eat gluten free these days i was really hoping to find a new restaurant i enjoyed and can eat at safely nope on both counts i would like to point out to you review readers to remember to read reviews carefully if they are superlative without offering many specifics or the details tend towards telling you what things cost and special offers and overspecific details about the ownersmanagers you might want to take the review with a big ol salt lick bombay spice is somebody s idea of making indian food more accessible and healthy what did they do  they deconstructed the cuisine breaking it down into components lrb meat or veg mostly rrb and sauces lrb korma tikka etc rrb they took out the cream and ghee lrb butter rrb and the msg lrb you may not know it but many indian restaurants use msg rrb the meat is cubed chicken breast and fish there is no paneer the enjoyment you derive from this menu comes exclusively from the selfcongratulatory superiority you feel from eating blandish deracinated indian food if you are a celiac like me you eat there because you can and there are few alternatives available the waitress was pleasant and friendly but utterly unknowledgeable about indian food bombay spice advertises itself as an indian restaurant healthy alternative with gluten free options this means that staff must know their way around indian cuisine basic nutritional issues and the glutenfree diet she lacked these understandings and did nt know what paneer is oh and she talked us into eating this chickpea ceviche i am weary of hummus and chickpeas on restaurant menus  the reason you are seeing hummus everywhere is because it s cheap to make  but my dining mate wanted this so i caved allow me first to be certain you know what ceviche is  it s fish marinated in chilis and or citrus and or garlic and onions and herbs bs s version of chickpea ceviche was this huge pile of chickpeas covered in this gloppy sweet pinkishgray sauce we were told it had onions and tomato and with diligent searching we each found one tiny lrb mm rrb cube of each in our dish it was all chickpeas and sweet yogurtbased glop this was a rare time i could not quite figure out what was in a dish by looking at it and tasting it was it chickpeas mixed with yoplait blueberry yogurt  perhaps my friend ate two bites and apologized to me for wanting to order it we also got the pappadums as a side with some sauces there were sauces offered  tamarind mintchilli red and a yogurt raita they supplied tiny spoons for the sauces we needed a couple more tiny spoons the sauces were okish but the red sauce tasted pretty much like hot paprika mixed with water and oil none of them were memorable the portions were very small less than tablespoon of each sauce except maybe t of the raita our entrees were acceptable in flavor the sauces were tasty and close enough to what you d expect they were just meat and sauce there was a problem though  my glutenfree entree came with triangles of bread surrounding it even a crumb of bread makes me ill  this is why i m so careful about eating out and do nt eat in restaurants that do nt understand the restrictions of the gf diet bombay spice advertises its glutenfree options this is why i was here the manager was friendly and accommodating but once something like this happens the cat is out of the bag and i know the kitchen staff does nt understand the gf diet and they ve probably thrown flour and bread crumbs everywhere and taken no precautions against cross contamination of breadish things into the other food i was now on notice and my bellyache hours later confirmed i d eaten more than a crumb of gluten at some point my wine glass was refilled gratis which was nice of them as an apology but it wo nt make things right for my intestines which unfortunately ca nt eat any gluten and wo nt heal for or days can somebody tell me why so many of the reviewers on here claim that glass wine is a great deal  it s not the bs wine list is full of bottles that retail for less than meaning their glasses cost them each and many other restaurants charge less for wine i got a glass recently in a restaurant and that s their regular price for house red finally the decor is dull  medium brown wood chairs typical restaurant benchish seating a long shotgun of a dining area with a semiopen kitchen not a place to go if you like interesting spaces overall this place is a dud
it starts with the chips and salsa which the chips are bland the salsa is liquedy and tasteless the margaritas are good but small and pricey i ordered the carna asada and enchilada the carna asada was quite good the enchilada was nonexistent i think they just gave me the shell of it and was buried under i guess what was beans and rice with cheese the plates are gross looking was nt worth that s for sure i think this place takes advantage of people nothing special and not worth the money for the poor quality of food
this is a busy dirty walmart and you shoud stay away from it shop at a target
omg drove up to the location today for my salt and vinegar fix and it is just gone with a dumb sign saying it had to close immediately for business reasons and to try one of the other locations that are all like an hour away i am devastated if they do nt open a new one around here soon i am starting a petition
i just played the course last week and it is in the worst shape i have ever seen it in the past seven years the majority of the sprinkler heads are broken and the course has nt seen water in a long time they also are about to loose  greens that have just started to turn brown i would avoid playing this corse unless you are desperate
burrito after a few bites i discovered i had been chewing on a piece of what appeared to be plastic like cigarette clear wrapping the size of a playing card the food is always cold between the food being cold every time i get a burrito there and now foreign objects in the burrito come on its arizona there s plenty of better places to get your burrito fix
i came in today for a manicurepedicure the pedicure was okay  the lady who did my nails messed up my big toe nail polish when she was putting on my sandal and tried to cover it up by filling in the crack with polish it did nt look good and i had to ask her to redo it over again my manicure was horrible upon the drive home i noticed that the sides of my nails were nt even painted also some of the tips of the nail were unevenly coatednot coated at all i had to try to match a color when i got home to fix it and became upset i called back asking for a refund lrb rrb for the manicure only the manager refused despite me threatening to file a dispute i am now forced to dispute the charge he offered for me to come back in and have them redone i was just sitting there for hours and i do nt have time to drive back there also i m leaving for alaska tomorrow and have other more important things to do lrb ie pack pick up prescriptions etc rrb i will not be going back and i will tell my friends to do the same
this place is really fake  i would never recommend it i mean it s fake because they are trying way to hard to be hip and laidback but it is nt at all i have to say that i ve only gone there twice both for friends birthdays so i ve never eaten or shopped there you basically have options if you re going to drink alcohol  gross beer lrb the priciest of the beers they have is pbr rrb or really expensive cocktails there is nothing in between not even a bud light or a well drink the staff is rude and the dj is horrible i wo nt be surprised if this place closes soon
 shakes head  i am baffled truly baffled how does a place like this stay in business  it s kinda crap well not kind of it is i ve been there on about different occasions the first were cringeworthy i have to confess that all the times i went was because i happened to be close by and the people i was with were all gung ho about it truth be told if they had waited about ish minutes i could ve had them at a different mexican restaurant  a million times better than serrano s the th time i went the chicken enchiladas i had were so incredibly good i felt that it made up for the previous times i happened to be in the neighborhood several weeks ago and dropped into serrano s nuh uh nerp nope hell to the no f  ck no never again my chicken enchiladas was gross and i ve never called any mexican food gross this was pathetic beyond description avoid this place the only truly redeeming quality were the servers we have had each time i ve gone there  fast friendly and courteous sadly it s not enough to make me want to go back
it had been years since i d been to this location and i will not be going back called in the order to be a quick pick up ended up waiting at the window for minutes for the staff trying to figure out how to split the check on two debit cards was treated very rudely by staff member michelle  manager sara and upon getting home the food was made incorrectly veggie burrito was just a bean and cheese thanks for the memories someburros but your rude staff and inability to get the food right means it will be another years before i give you my business
although there is lots of fun to be had here  the atmosphere of the show does not make up for the lack of cleanliness and overall ick factor i love me some dive bars but this one was a little too subterranean that and please ladies  when you are lip syncing at least know half of the words to the song just moving your mouth and jaw like an automaton is not fun or attractive
my inital reaction very clean bright and organized these folks have tanning down to a science from package deals to prorated fees and upgrades you do nt have to worry about streching your buck they ll take your money and figure out the math but they ll clue you in ask them for advice and they happily oblige with different levels the tanning options are diverse this includes the package deals and the different styles of tanning beds not to mention their plethora of tanning lotions and ointments oh and did i mention they have a butt ton of magazines to read  only i have nt once had to wait more than a couple minutes to tan but it s always comforting to know the  zines are there when you first join you pay the membership fee which will then be applied to your first package you also buy your eye wear and are expected to bring it each time if you forget you can buy some little coppery stickers for like something to note there is a monthly fee if you ask me it s a bit absurd but like i said these guys have this down to a science it s almost genius how they run this place even the cleaning lady is on top of things i would recommend this place to anyone who has the extra stash of cash laying around for with a monthly fee  package lrb average one offered rrb that adds up to a pretty penny or two or a thousand then if you want some bronze on your hot bod you have to buy the lotion the cheapest they offer runs over lrb something to note the package grants me an avg of tans if i go for a max of minutes per tan at level so yeah rrb it s definitley a scottsdale establishment in that regard i m happy to report though that none of the people working the front desk are snotty rude or impatient they have always been friendly and helpful and to me that s worth its weight in gold
very very professional very nice and excellent work what more can i say i used them for a business vehicle repair and they were wonderful and fast with the repairs i will use them again for both my personal or fleet vehicles and consider them a great find
the munchies is great the owners are so nice i look forward to seeing them when i pick up my lunch i have only had the gyro here but it s delicious
love this mall its pricey but its clean of all the trashy people and it has great stores  rrb enough said check it out
the hardest part of going glutenfree for me is the sweets i had some geneticgift of being able to eat all the sugary stuff i want without really gaining any weight at least i thought it was a gift until my doctor told me that the digestive issues that i have suffered my whole life  one that really kicked in this past year  is caused by my consuming gluten she said that if i continue to eat that way my pain would get worse and i could even be at risk for cancer or a paralyzed colon i just know it sucks because i am forced to change my diet trader joes has been a lifesaver though with a glutenfree butter cookie that tastes sooooo gooood it s like it s a regular cookie  verses some of the cardboardchew i am finding i do nt know the name of the cookie  but if you go into joe s their awesome people will point you in the right direction i love it  i love it  i love it
i want to be buried here super friendly and very helpful people i was trying to figure out what i could mix pumpkin pie vodka with and the manager hopped on the computer and helped me figure it out they were sampling blood orange martinis whiskey wine grand marnier i mean it s like costco for grown ups love it
great place good bar type food and great service
pv obgyn is great my vagina and uterus have received wonderful care over the years by dr dado laura waggener np and margarett gossett np lrb i get around hehe rrb their professionalism and friendly bedside manner make the awkward positioning and nakedness of our meetings a little more comfortable the ancillary staff is just as friendly and professional the office itself is new and very modern the waiting area is beautiful with plenty of spacious seating and a coffee station to visit while you wait the exam rooms have a huge tv in it that you can navigate yourself and learn about any ob or gyn issue you may have or might just be curious about also i love the fact that you do nt have to feel any pressure when you get changed when you are ready all you have to do is push the green button and it lets your care provider know you are ready for them to come in
the lady at behind the bakery section in the morning seem very nice as for the rest of the workers seems like it ll kill them to say good morning but the prices for the baked goods ca nt beat them
i needed my clutch replaced and called everyone from the dealership to chain repair shops and speciality shops i saw mr mechanic and decided to call and see if he could quote me a price i spoke to tim who was very nice and had no problem speaking to me over the phone answering every question i had not only did he quote me a price over the phone lrb which most of the places i called refused to do rrb he was also by far the most reasonably priced tim also scheduled a saturday appointment to work around my schedule once i dropped off my car i also explained that my daughter had dropped coins in my cd player and my radio and door locks no longer worked he mentioned that he d take a look while he was working on it not only did he replace the clutch he also repaired the short in my electrical and removed the coins from the cd player when i picked up my car everything had been fixed and my oil and air filter had be changed and all for less than most of the quotes i had received to just replace my clutch tim really takes the time to explain everything in language you understand and is quick to do what he can to accomidate you i was also impressed with not only the one year warranty on my new clutch but also the month warranty on his labor just give him a call and have a chat with him about your car im sure you ll feel the same way i did when i decided to use him no more chain shops or dealerships for me i ve finally found an affordable mechanic that i can dare i say it trust thank you tim i will be back again and again i also took of his business cards to refer my friends
i have been to mabel s a few times now and i think it is a pretty stellar place the food is awesome lrb try the chicken lollypops and the deviled eggs rrb and the drinks are strong the ambiance is nice and cozy and i think it works well for a romantic dinner or a big group of friends the staff has always been pleasant and accommodating and that goes a long way for me in snottsdale last night i was wowed by mabel s we had a fundraiser for a great friend who has cancer and they not only let us throw it there for free but generously offered to donate  of the bar tab to the cause the service was great that night and they earned a fan for life thanks mabel s for being so cool you re a breath of fresh air
i passed this place a few days ago and it looked like it was already open i stopped in tonight for the first time and was told that they just opened yesterday this is a nice location with a patio i like what this plaza did with the traffic flow too this smashburger did not disappoint because i got smashed tonight i had a regular smashburger with grilled onions jalapenos tomatoes lettuce sweet relish and mustard on an egg bun the burger was juicy and perfectly cooked what more could you want
on a whim i came in for a few extra bites after a yelp event with some friends i thought it d be light but i was wrong even their so called appetizers will have you full from the richness they entail i m surprised that on a tuesday night it d be so crowded but the place felt alive and fun the scallops with risotto came with large heavily seasoned scallops on top of a mixed risotto this was in the appetizer section but it was a good lunch size portion i would say the mac and cheese and crispy potato chips as part of the bread crumb ish topping i m a sucker for truffled mac and cheese so this was the first victim to be obliterated no prisoners here i will be ordering this every single time i return the pulled pork appetizer was more than enough for us to split ways it came with hard boiled eggs and some vegetables covered in a sauce that looked like ponzu sauce but was not actually ponzu sauce but whatever it was absolutely delicious lastly being a meatatarian i rarely order salads but the hype about the stetson salad has solid ground i do nt know what exactly makes it so special but like the menu description said i would lrb probably rrb make a picture of this chopped salad part of my screen saver because it s heroic how good it is i also bought some of their gourmet popcorn on the way out the door i could nt turn down chocolate hazelnut pretzel popcorn or chocolate bacon popcorn i mean when do you ever come across these types of snacks  my only dislike was that my diet soda was i was actually taken aback by that since i m used to sodas being half that but whatever i m one to talk i did after all and on a whim buy two mini bags of gourmet popcorn
food is awesome it is actually a small snackshoplike place in a grocery store pros  food is tasty authentic  prices are good  lots of options  fast and hot  ordering is simplistic filled out in a piece of paper cons  small seating is limited  owners lrb old guy and his son rrb at the counter are always chewing tobacco and moody  the use and throw cutlery is a bit cheapo but hygienic
oh ice tango why do i love thee  the small is freaking huge i have a hard time imagining eating more the tart is surprisingly tart  and sooo very refreshing what an awesome pickmeup the fresh fruit additions are marvelous  my diced strawberries were so generously scooped into my cup that i had more strawberries than froyo at the end of my serving it is less than miles from my new job i may just make this a regular onthewayhome treat with so few calories involved could you fault me 
one of the best bbq restaurants i ve been too the place looks a little run down but it only adds character open late lrb til pm i believe rrb this is a quick easy lunch or dinner for us my favorites are the bbq beef sandwich potato salad and the cobbler is great too a definite must and there are multiple locations throughout the valley
are you kidding me this place is great perfectly sized bread quality ingredients cool staff when i think dream sub i think italian night club no mayo and extra peppers do nt get no betta
what makes me feel better about being another year older  perfectly cooked beets in a mustard cream sauce thanks tuck shop i had attempted to eat here a few weeks previously but unbeknownst to me it was the coronado historic district neighborhood festival  and the regretful host informed us the wait was an hour and a half the courteousness of the host the brief peek i had of the interior that night and a quick scan of their menu online when we got home secured it as a top choice for my birthday dinner and by making my reservation for a week in advance we were in because there were so many of us we were able to order quite a few dishes and trade around  a practice that the waiter had greatly encouraged when we ordered by saying the dishes were served  familystyle and meant for sharing for that descriptor i expected bigger portions but they turned out to be closer to a sizing i generally prefer  moderate the quality was excellent wellchosen flavor pairings and everything had that great homemade quality  nothing came out cookiecutter style i was very interested in the cheese and chorizo stuffed medjools but as i m a vegetarian  i opted for the fontina  pear panini plate we even received an interesting tip from our waiter while gorging on the slab of chocolate decadence we ordered for dessert  bleu cheese to break the palette and offset the sweetness not bad definitely for the adventurer the only thing i would have passed on was the cookie dough ball parting taster their presentation was lovely four or five little dough balls drizzled in chocolate  though in the end i ve had better raw cookie dough lrb i ve been spoiled by wanda s magical cookie dough from sack s for years now rrb and it did nt quite live up to the rest of the fare but hell  they were free
i ve only used their online store since i live in the san francisco bay area so i ca nt review their brick and mortar shop but as far as online shopping goes they re great very basic online presence which is fine with me the quality of their spices is top notch their blends are interesting their gift sets are really handy and i like the fact that they offer a wide range of sizes for most of their items from an oz bag to a oz jar of basil to a lb or oz bag of star anise there is often the choice of whole spices or ground as well some fun exotic goodies as well like sanaam chili peppers charnushka lrb nigella sativa rrb or mahlab lrb sour cherry rrb so far i also like all their blended spices as well grill rubs chicken seasonings have nt tried their salad mixes or cheese sprinkles yet but i m sure they re good i ve ordered from penzey s numerous times and they ve never let me down they re very consistent be sure to get their catalog mailer which comes with helpful recipes and suggestions then get cooking rrb
i used a travelzoo package at the aji spa at the sheraton wild horse pass resort for on a monday  thursday i got to choose from a massage or facial plus lunch from the aji cafe along with a glass of champagne tip was not included in the package price therefore when i arrived i had to pay tip is  automatic on the full price service even though they have midweek specials on services i chose the facial and aesthetician portia gave me a wonderful minute facial and relaxing neck and shoulder massage i feel she made my service very worthwhile because she took the time to explain the service we discussed my skin and skincare practices and the products she would choose and use for my facial i have had facials peels and dermabrasion before so i knew what to expect and the quality of the facial from portia at aji spa was up there with the best of them loved the product line too and there was no pressure to purchase that day just sent a brochure with me i hate it when products are pushed in front of my face while i m lying down on the table during the service portia did not do that she showed me what i asked about after the service was complete the service bed was heated and the room was relaxing very professional service provider so i was very happy with that just to touch on other parts of my visit to the aji spa the checkin at the front desk was great quick and easy and both front desk staff remembered my name during the time i came back up to get my lunch that had been set aside since i was eating after the cafe had closed at pm i had requested this when i book my appointment on the phone they also have online booking options if you register to do so the facilities are phenomenal i have been to probably spas in vegas and a handful of wonderful spas on cruise ships aji spa competes right up there with the best of them i love this spa and would certainly return again there is an aromatherapy steam room inside the women s locker room which i think they use their own native american herbs which is just heavenly an indoor and outdoor spa tub in the women s locker room area and a dry sauna as well fully stocked locker room with showers mirrored getting ready area etc there is a coed waiting area for services or just a women s waiting lounge the lotion soap etc all have an earthy native american kind of smell which is very nice and spa like i liked the coed area better as there was a fireplace and more seating it just seemed cozier also hot towels with a little bit of the native american herb liquid on them also the whole aji spa is in a separate building from the hotel and resort so there is a separate pool just for the spa beautiful relaxing outdoor spaonly pool area with tables and lounge chairs several jacuzzi spa tubs are part of the pool and at separate as well the pool overlooks part of the golf course and into the western mountain area very quiet and relaxing there is even a separate little area by the pool for yoga plus a fantastic fullyequipped fitness center i did nt use the fitness center but it looked great despite using a travelzoo package for my first visit to aji spa i will probably be back and paying full price because i enjoyed my visit so much and left feeling so rejuvenated i may try to go back on a monday  thursday as they run specials as listed on their website full price would still be worth it to me i really enjoyed my facial lunch the use of the beautiful facilities and the customer service i received at aji spa
this gem on th avenue and camelback is one of the most traditional chinese restaurants lrb american rrb that i ve ever been and the food is super delicious five stars hands down
i love this place the coffee shop opened when i was still living in az  was going to grad school in mesa even though it was about a min drive from my school lrb and there was at least starbucks that were closer rrb when i had the time in between classes i would come here i m happy after all these years lrb okay it s been like ish rrb the coffee shop is still around and has actually grown not that i had doubts based on quality  service but i still consider this location to be somewhat in nomans land even though i no longer live in az when i come home to visit i have a friend who lives close by so i still try and dropin when i go to visit them maybe i m exaggerating this but i think the place has grown over the years there s tons of seating both indoors and outdoors and there s even a cute little living room type area wcozy couches the atmosphere here is very clean  open now for as much as i love coffeeespresso i m not a huge connoisseur of it but that being said whether it be chai or a latte the drinks here are great what really sets this place apart from other coffee shops though is the food particularly the baked goods the scones muffins  cupcakes are all fantastic there s a huge open kitchen where you can see these delicious pastries being made as far as the sandwiches soups and breakfasts i ca nt really say much since i ve never had any of that stuff but i m sure they re yummy if they re anything like the baked goods the coffee shop is nt exactly located in the most central area and i would nt necessarily go out of my way to come here but when i m relatively close by i make it a point to come here even if it means bypassing other coffee shops along the way
this is one of those places that i wish you son of a bitches did not know about just kidding that is what makes this place is the cool peeps lrb unless i can not get a table rrb when we arrived did not want to valet so we drove to colter and walked over cardio complete had the honor on a sunday for brunch with a homey ok this is what sunday funday really is pitchers of beer lrb good stuff  get at least beers outta one rrb the bloody mary bar was in full effect and so here is what we ate apps  gotta have the corn dog poppers i mean your drinking beer they were excellent main meal  backyard burger windsor style buddy had the picnic kebobs  chicken pork shrimp  mixed veggie with spicy pepper dip all really tasty i mean really good all the food looked really good and my neighbors at the bar were nice enough to give us their favorites list for our next trip look forward to a patio table next time and a chance at the ceviche
i typically put auto mechanics in the same category as auto dealerships wolves that prey on those that either do nt have the knowledge or motivation to take care of their auto needs themselves for this reason i buy cars used private party do my own repairs whenever possible and generally save thousands of dollars when it came time to do my timing belt on my runner i decided that the job was a little beyond my skill level lrb plus it was over f outside at the time rrb i shopped the work around and was quoted about  fot the timing belt replacement alone at the local dealerships i was referred to cary by a friend of mine who had recently had work done and was very impressed by his level of honesty and knowledge i rolled the dice and was completely satisfied cary gave me a ball park quote and started work immediately he ended up replacing my timing belt water pump thermostat drive and accessory belts a bearing for lrb including tax parts labor and materials rrb he also did a complete coolant change with the rather spendy red yota coolant this was done in hours dropped off at am done by lunch awesome could not have been happier with the service he tore everything down gave me a quote and then invoiced me for the quoted price after this experience i have decided that i am better served taking it to him than doing complex stuff myself i would lost the better part of a weekend doing what he did in a few hours highly highly recommended
we got our wedding cake form slice in may of and it was amazing chef chris even came to our home with mini cakes of different flavors so we could pick our favorite i told her to bring a more traditional white chocolate rasberry for me to try and my wife picked a key lime cake i thought she was crazy but of course she was right it was delicious everyone at the wedding said it was hands down the best wedding cake they had ever had i would reccomend her to anyone give her a try you wo nt be disappointed i still crave that key lime cake all the time o rrb
just had an excellent dinner here the other night  we had great service on a very busy night lrb the final four games were on rrb too my meal three sisters salsa trio nice way to start a meal for a group three different salsas lrb two red one green rrb with homemade tortilla chips and fry bread barbeque glazed salmon over squashsweet potato hash and a tamarind sauce i have nt had a salmon dish this goodunique in a long time highly recommended and the obligatory margarita lrb known as a tontorita here rrb  very good we sat inside but the outdoor seating area looked great hoping to visit again someday soon to enjoy the outdoor setting in person
my favorite place to get coffee they will remember your name and they are such nice people it is in an old historic house in downtown mesa where they offer yoga classes as well the courtyard is an excellent place to relax when the weather is nice they know their coffee and they have some great healthy lunch options check it out you ll love it
so i was living in phoenix for about a year and lived blocks from this spot hands down my favorite bar lrb and i live in texas currently rrb always great atmosphere killer selection of beers and rotating ones too same owners who own matts big breakfast so everyone is like family almost i recommend the house beer i would have and be faded luckily i walked but do nt get drunk like me just a great place to chill eat some simple snacks and watch some old school westerns on their tv kick ass place i miss lrb
in terms of mexican joints this place is the best with the outdoor atmosphere tacky decor and authentic food it just does nt get any better the other locations are just as good the staff is usually pretty cool too although one time we waited a very long time to get served at the scottsdale location
my friends came in town from st louis we tried taco tuesdays and the meals were all outstanding the freshly made guacamole and three different salsas were the best the fresh fire roasted chile salsa is the best ever the owner is also the chef and she is both nice and a great cook this is one of our favorite mexican places in town
i m really surprised at the negative reviews of the clarendon from people on here i ve never had anything but get bar service either on the roof or in the lounge while i ve never stayed at the clarendon we go every so often to hang out with friends for a few drinks to begin the rooftop is amazing it is the perfect place for those cool winter nights they even have heaters if you get too cold the bar upstairs is nt fully stocked but they have enough to save you a trip downstairs finally the view is really impressive it is great to escape the craziness every so often the pool area is one of the best in phx i guess they charge now but i hear you get a towel and sunblock so i do nt suppose that s a bad thing the pool is gorgeous especially at night and there are always pretty people around it the interior of the hotel is classic strange art pieces and rolling stoneinspired urinals really bring out the quirks of this place the lounge and bar are nicely appointed and really make for a great place to hang out when the temperatures are inhospitable also do nt forget the amazing gallo blanco restaurant inside i simply love the clarendon and am totally excited for the temps to cool off so i can hit the rooftop again
i love this place it is small personal and just full of good vibes chris is a one man show and yes it is that crazy as it sounds how he does it all i am not sure but i can witness that he does nt have arms either he looks so chill that you assume he does nt know the definition of stress jealous  yea i was back to dinner it is a byob  awesome pre fixed dinner of person you need reservations for dinner when you call he asks you your preferences chicken meat seafood any allergies etc you come in and he first serves the appetizer mine was an assortment of vegetables lrb mushrooms eggplant pesto tomatoes rrb and lots of goodness the entree fish cakes with this sweet sauce dessert was amazing fruits like plums and berries over this cream and flaky crust it was aromatic and sweet but just the right amount chris is so sweet and makes you feel comfortable the bathroom was cool looking too rrb
i think hana is one of the best casual sushi experiences in phoenix i went there with friends almost once a week for the last year until i moved they are small and cosy but very friendly and helpful admittedly the first time i went i was a tad bit underwhelmed with the service as the girl was efficient but very reserved feels strange after the chattiness of most wait staff but the fish was excellent so we went back and really they are all lovely just not as effusive as usual best feature of all is the byo  bring beer or wine and they will provide the cups and keep your bottles in the fridge no charge the rainbow carpaccio is sublime the sashimi is always fresh and most importantly they have fresh wasabi now fresh wasabi is a new experience for me but it is so far beyond the standard wasabi paste it will knock your socks off i am now seriously disappointed when i go to an upscale sushi restaurant and they do not have it i ve moved now and have not managed to find anything as good lucky lucky downtown phoenicians take advantage of this great local sushi joint
the food is so fresh and full of flavor the fresh steamed vegetables are crisp and bright and offered with most dishes the food preparation is a bit slow compared to other small places but they really seem to put care into preparing a quality dish the owner is very friendly and sometimes talks to the customers i wish they had a few more kidfriendly dishes that would make it easy for my kids to enjoy the food like a dish with noodles and a sweet sauce and some fresh tofu and veggies on top
this is by far the best chinese food in the valley the pan fried noodles and sesame chicken are awesome i eat here at least once a week
st francis is one of my very favorite resturaunts in phoenix their menu is super interesting and everything i have had is delicious though i have only had one thing because it is so delicious i get it every time i usually get the chicken which has green olives also it has a very kind of swank trendy feel without the least bit of pretension which makes it very nice this is demonstrated by how super kid friendly the place is there is even a box of toys that your toddler can play with and one time when we went there the hosts practically babysitted our daughter playing with her at the toy box it is so nice to go to a very grown up kind of resturaunt where they welcome children so throughoughly
for a chain baja fresh makes some really good mexican food always fresh and delicious my favorite is the baja burrito with grilled chicken the side salad is a great deal try the salsa verde dressing enjoy
really cute place with a modern hipster vibe service is fast and friendly and everything always seems organized and clean their order up front and wait for your food at your table makes it a quick way to have a nice sit down breakfast with your family without the wait of regular sitdown restaurants their veg scramble option has sun dried tomatoes in it which just rocks my world they put a lot of thought into making their menu unique and provide delish healthy options above just the wheat pancakes of other breakfast places my official recommendations are anything with the veg mix in it their turkey sausage wheat pancakes and the lox breakfast but truly  everything on the menu is worth having
my favorite happy hour on the planet i would travel many miles to get my hands on their spicy tuna
great spot to go to when you want to wash your own car its really affordable and the staff is really friendly i usually go on the weekends and a man named dannon always helps me with what ever i need there s a lot of air fresheners towels cleaners etc to choose from in the vending machine its a great family owned business id definitely recommend it if your not too lazy i always feel great knowing i washed my own car when i leave
i hav nt been able to find a place with tastier wings than this the mango habenero wings are the best its really the sauce that makes them so if you order anything else from the menu that gives you a choice of wing sauce get the mango habenero if you love spicy its sweet but very spicy lrb nd to last in line for spiciness of the sauces rrb but the flavor is beyond amazing another flavor that is good is the asian zing if you are not that into spice the hub loves the garlic parmesan wings kind of a different flavor and might not be for some people if you are not a wing lover there are other items on their menu that are good choices i love their buffalo chicken flatbread pizza as well as their buffalitos for sides and appetizers their buffalo chips crispy southwest dippers roasted garlic mushrooms with southwest ranch and slammers with hamburger and pepperjack cheese and pretty legit for wing lovers remember that tuesday is their cheap wing night and thursday is cheap boneless wings also while you are waiting on your food make sure to request a trivia  poker device so you can play games as you wait lastly if you are on a strict diet do not go here i do nt think there is one healthy thing on their menu even their salad is loaded with cheese
i was drug here kicking and screaming by my hair imagine you are out with your friends it s late ok very late or maybe early around am ish any way your drunk and starving what do you do demand waffle house or jack in the box no such luck with this bunch they pulled in to village inn i am not a happy drunk at this point i finally come to terms with the fact that our designated driver will not drive me elsewhere and begin to review the menu i decide on a patty melt with onion rings i am whining about my choice and just generally being a belligerent drunk wanting to boycott then the food came and quickly i might add holy rye bread drenched in butter and grilled to perfection this was a damn good patty melt i wanted to order another i have been back times since sober to get it and it is good the onion rings i get with it are decent too that is why they have a star from me the deliciousness of that little patty melt they get snaps in a circle damn patty is like a monkey on my back now just gotta get my fix
there is so much buried treasure in here being an avid hater of buffalo exchange finding out about another second hand store within a couple blocks was amazing now i ve never sold anything to sunset but the one thing that i can say is that i m not going to have some bitchy nineteen year old hipster buying my thirty dollar shirt for three bucks cash or ten bucks store credit screw your store credit if i wanted a fifteen year old stussy shirt i  ld go to a garage sale in mesa the selection at sunset is very good and you do nt have to go sifting through a pile of hobo rags to find the goods also it s all pretty reasonable priced and in almost new condition not gently used by some shitty hobo condition that s not even what i really go there for when i need a quick totally awesome piece of jewelry that fit s my girlfriends style and wo nt cost upwards of fifty or a hundred dollars this is the holy land every time i ve swung through casually looking for a gift i find something more often than not that is better than what i was looking for people really should shop here more not only for the great deals and selection but also because the employees wo nt treat you like trash stuck to there yuppie hipster leather boots instead you ll be treated like a nice person by some people that probably look like people that would wear yuppie hipster leather boots but really they have shiny pretty nice people leather boots on instead
one of the things i love about my neighborhood is that cornish pasty is win walking distance every pasty ive had here is awesome my personal faves include the shepherds pie the chicken pot pie and the thanksgiving pasty yes its tiny and loud but it adds to the charm also the smell that you smell right when you walk in the door  heaven we eat in and get to go tip for to go have a beer or a cider w  your wait

i have been to this hotel multiple times and i have never been disappointed with my stay it is tradition for my family to stay here over easter weekend when the weather is perfect for laying poolside all day the service at the pool is excellent despite how packed the pools can sometimes be the server was very friendly and was constantly checking on us and was always there when i needed another mai tai we usually stay in the casitas which are spacious nicely furnished and lucky for me right next to the pool over all of the times that i ve been here i think that it s safe to say i have hit all of the dining options that the phoenician offers when i stay here i always prefer to dine at the hotel rather than venture off to the many nearby restaurants relish has some of the biggest and best burgers that i ve ever had i met my dad there after he finished playing golf and had the apple turkey burger with sweet potato fries followed by the cookie skillet which i finished by myself  it was too good to leave any behind they also have an italian restaurant and a steakhouse which are both pricey but very good all of my meat and fish were cooked perfectly however i ordered the shrimp cocktail at the italian place and would have like to see more shrimp one of my favorites is sunday brunch  they have either a buffet or a course tasting menu or both since it was the last day of my vacation and i could hit the gym when i got back i decided to get both everything was amazing normally buffets are nt my favorite but they did a good job of keeping all of the food hot and high quality my third course was the dessert tower which had a variety of different desserts that were the perfect size and very tasty there are also a lot of things to do nearby there is a mountain that is right behind the hotel that i like to hike to make myself feel better about all the food that i m eating there is also a huge mall minutes away that i could easily spend all day at overall i always love my stays at the phoenician the service and staff are great the food is amazing and the location is beautiful
very nice and helpful staff
nice waiters great food you really due pay for the atmosphere and the ambiance in my view its worth it i dont see to many places with the feel this place has i just was on my way from portland and was lead to this place unknowingly and it was just what i needed waiters are nice one of the bartenders kind of an one uper but over all nice people to talk to soon to be a duke

this tiny restaurant packs a punch of awesomeness if you speed by north nd avenue and west roosevelt street in downtown phoenix not only will you get a speeding ticket but you will definitely miss out on one of the hole in the wall restaurants in phoenix i tried their herb crusted rack of lamb which came with the chorizo and manchego risotto and it was to die for my wife was not a wine drinker but had their sweet red wine lrb forgot the name but found in aj s food market on centralcamelback rrb and she wanted the some for her next house party the other dishes we had were the spinach brie  grapes blackberry spinach salad white truffle pizza and meatballs marsala my mouth and tummy was very happy that night thank you centurion great customer service and place was very small definitely need to set a reservation ahead of time before coming here but news flash our waitress stated they were going to extend the place and will occupy the business space to their west lrb unknown when they will begin this project rrb another great location for a date night and would also recommend it to visitors family and friends definitely a must visit
crackers has been a long term staple for me held over from my days as a mesa resident you just ca nt go wrong here offering breakfast and lunch everything on the menu sounds delicious and everything i ve had was even better i d love to be able to say that i ve tried everything but let s be real here  it s a big menu crackers offers an average of six different soup selections every day with one or two daily specials same with dessert  daily selections may vary both are homemade  no boxes or cans here  and they taste like the best thing your mom ever made for you only maybe a little better lrb assuming your mother was a good cook rrb the breakfast offerings are hearty and full of flavor the lunch offerings run the gamut from light snack to full blown food coma material great stuff like meredith said the decor is nt anything special  it has nt changed much in the years or so since i first ate here i think they re going for homey country charm it does nt matter though  this is nt a place to go for ambiance unless you re a reclusive mormon housewife crackers has two other locations  one out in east mesa and one in tempe i have nt been to either of those but this one is definitely a winner
whoever said that british food was gross and bland has never tried this place the owner dean is an amazing person with a passion for his food and it shows in everything that is served the best guinness in arizona to go with a filling oggie the traditional pasty i found this gem while at asu and make a stop there every time i m in the valley
we went on a recent saturday night four of us were racking our brains trying to think of somewhere different to go to dinner together we were tired of the same old places near us so i finally remembered about dick s hideaway the other couple had never been there my husband and myself had been there about times before but not in a long while we had always eaten at a table in the bar area which is so cozy but we actually were sat in the private dining room which we had only been able to peek into before it was really a treat we started with the roasted garlic platter which we have ordered as an appetizer every time we have been there it is quite a lot of food for as a starter it is amazing you know that you are going to pay for it the next day but we just ca nt resist there were specials that night three of us decided on a special for our dinners my girlfriend  i had the fresh sea bass first we got a salad included which was very good with a house dressing the portion of fish was very large and so amazingly delicious my friend said it was some of the best she has ever had and i have to agree the plate is filled to the brim with a medley of fresh vegetables and their special green chili pepper mashed potatoes my husband had the mixed grill special which included medallions of pork tenderloin filet mignon and a couple of lamb chops the meats were perfect my girlfriend s husband had the surf and turf from the regular menu and i figure he liked his as well since the plate was clean i am always a bit nervous recommending to eat out somewhere that is a bit on the pricey side but they ca nt wait to go back neither can i

this little mexican joint has to have the best mouth watering orgasmic beef tongue tacos on the face of this planet my pastor introduced me to this place while my friend and i were starving in our little office ready to devour every thing we laid eyes on i ordered beef tongue tacos and i tell you it s amazing the tortillas are made fresh in front of your eyes and the tongue must of been braised for hours upon hours because the meat just melts in your mouth matter a fact get the burrito you ll get more meat and is cheaper with your burrito and tacos that you purchase you also receive a roasted onion and jalapeno on the side if you want more pickled jalapenos or carrots radishes amazing salsas they re available if you truly want a delicious burrito drop by any i think there are locations in phoenix  do nt eat the americanized chipotle junk this place blows chipotle out of the water

amazing customer service my husband and i told them it was our anniversary and not only did they send over a compimentary bottle of champagne but the sushi chef came out and introduced himself and asked if he could prepare a special  course meal for us  this is very uncommon these days and we were beyond happy we ended up staying there for almost  hours wonderful wonderful food was fantastic as well

 years ago chef johnny chu set out to bring a hot pot restaurant to the valley of the sun if you re unfamiliar with chef chu he s the proprietor of the hip and popular downtown phoenix asian tapas joint sens now his dream is realized with the opening of tien wong hot pot surprisingly his new restaurant is nt even located in downtown phoenix but in the city of chandler after talking with chef chu on my last visit he explained to me that this location was selected to prove out his concept in an asian neighborhood low rent and a discerning customer base he can make all the necessary tweaks for success and will hopefully bring tien wong to downtown in the future for many the whole hot pot experience might be foreign since many of us are used to having our food cooked for us forget that the idea of hot pot while romantic and interactive is all about you cooking various meats and vegetables in hot pots filled with flavored broths each table is equipped with a high powered induction burner where you hot pot is placed and then you order as many different raw meats seafood vegetables and noodles as you desire once our order started showing up i become overwhelmed and confused where do you start  what are the cooking times  what do i do  before allowing my head to explode i simply took a breather and one of the helpful staff to my aid in my calamity i did nt notice the helpful hints on the welcome card however it goes something like this the broth boils you drop in the thinly sliced meats pull out dip into one of sauces sesame and soy then eat easy after only a few minutes of practice it all came together into a well crafted experience that s designed for socializing romance and lingering if you have difficulty choosing your broth opt for the ying yang broth lrb rrb which includes both the house original herbal broth and the house spicy broth with the later being the most complex of the flavors i ve tried starting with pork stock the addition of dried dates ginseng schezuan peppercorns and dried chiles give the base heat and depth over the course of your evening the broth evaporates with cooking which adds to the intensity and enjoyment not to be confused with the tips of peas pea tips lrb rrb actually are the leaves and stems surrounding the pea itself the tips cook fast and have both crunchy and tender qualities that taste so good either cooked or raw by contrast the korean pumpkin lrb rrb takes longer to cook but the payoff is so tender you can even eat the thin skin noodles include springy udon lrb rrb as well as a flat rice noodle lrb rrb which resemble chewy flat pieces of rice than a noodle in the traditional sense both cook up in a hurry and their absorbent properties are capable for taking in so much flavor sliced wagyu beef lrb rrb comes from one of the best breeds of cattle in the world so its no surprise that the meat was flavorful and tender add an order of lobster lrb rrb if available for a surf and turf combo names are nt always accurate descriptions take sliced black pork lrb rrb which is nt black at all the name refers to the pigs breed since it has black hair and skin it s super tender and flavorful only taking a few seconds to cook thanks to expert slicing desserts feature different kind of cheesecake strawberry lrb rrb and green tea lrb rrb both were light and satisfying the perfect ending to chef chu s dream
it was a quiet and warm evening as we walked up th street and over the canal as we crossed the canal we could see hundreds of bats flitting to and fro just over the water s surface as they chased down the many insects that are attracted to the coolness of the canal i like bats bats are cool just across the canal lies chelsea s kitchen an offshoot of the lgo empire  and a successful one at that this restaurant occupies a location where many have tried and failed but it seems like these guys came up with the right formula situated right on the canal bank there is an outdoor patio that serves as both a bar and dining area with large open doors into the restaurant we put our name in for a table on that patio and the hostess asked for my phone number  kinda odd i thought but then she explained she would text me when the table is ready  how cool is that  we pushed through the crowd and found a couple of seats at the bar and shortly put in some drink orders me a duvel draft and the wife a sangria the duvel was served in the correct glass  which seems to be happening more often in america and i like it we tried to converse over the loud and busy crowd  barely able to but it was also fun peoplewatching and listening to the drunk executive nearby who did nt stop talking for like twenty minutes his partner looking somewhat bored and trapped soon my phone buzzed and there was our table the bartender was kind enough to transfer our drinks to the dinner tab i left a tip and joined my wife as she was led to our table shortly our server arrived and we ordered some wine we were nt sure about the wine so the server brought us a taste  it was a delicious wild rock pinot from new zealand we went for the bottle after pouring we ordered our dinner she grilled swordfish street tacos me grilled ribeye street tacos this dish comes with a tangy chopped kale salad pico de gallo and fresh house made guacamoles and corn tortillas the tortillas were awesome made to order and held our taco ingredients perfectly chelsea s was not skimpy on the tortillas either offering four for each of us my ribeye was cooked a perfect medrare and sliced into bitesized pieces perfect for tacos my wifes swordfish was grilled perfectly again sliced for taco consumption this was a perfect meal and washed down with the wine sitting on the patio  the ambiance was what this city needs more patio dining that is actually conducive to dining rather than some afterthought space with a few tables tossed in afterward we walked back home stopping at br for an icecream cone dessert a perfect end to a perfect meal
i have been to this location in awhile but my coworker from in was in town she wanted something healthy so pita jungle popped in my mind she absolutely loved it she commented on how trendy the place is she loved the pasta salad and the portion is huge i ordered the humus and grilled chicken with roasted pinenuts omg this is my favie now move over chicken philly steak hello my new friend humus with grilled chicken with roasted pinenuts the pita was plenty mmmmmmm
i m so sad that harvest closed lrb
nate s barber shop has been at this location for years now but nate is no longer alive the shop is now owned by a father and son team who kept the business model the same the father used to work for nate and he is now the owner of the shop it s not a posh place and more old school than upscale but they do a good job i do nt like to go to those snooty toffee nose boutiques and prefer to support low maintenance shops like nate s barber shop they take cash only good for them banks and merchants continue to rob small businesses with their high monthly fees so i do nt mind paying for my haircut with paper currency
i love this restaurant on beautiful days for lunch had a wonderful relaxing fun lunch on the patio service attentive without being intrusive good food and a great chardonnay heaven
i went to frys in the late afternoon with a sleeping toddler when he woke up and we went into the store he was grumpy this is not usually my mo and i can count on one hand how many times my now three year old has had a public melt down he had to use the restroom where the tantrum over not having a car cart continued as he did his business in between sobs he managed to say mommy i want a car cart an employee of the store happened to be in the bathroom and have me a sympathetic look and left after talking my son off of the proverbial ledge with a promise of a stroll through the toy aisle he finally ceased the sobs and soldiered on as we exited the bathroom there was the store manager waiting for us with a car cart for my traumatized son never in a million years would i have thought i would be so relieved to see such an mundane object my son immediately perked up gave her a big hug a thank you and she was off this is outstanding customer service besides i later got milk on sale for gal and then scored junior a toy on clearance for this is a great store that will always have me lrb and hopefully a happier tot next time rrb as customers
the antithesis of starbucks independent coffee shop at its finest bungalow with slacker types on macs board games and dudes with dreadlocks on their fourth quadruple espresso latte for the day lrb and it is only pm rrb americano was unbelievably smooth made me swear off corporate coffee for almost a week lrb until i had no choice rrb
thai basil is my goto carryout thai place i love the green curry mmmm green curry the staff is very friendly they do nt just say trite things when they talk to you they are definitely interested in getting to know their patrons that makes a big difference to me the food is always always fresh i love how the carrots are scalloped and obviously never frozen fresh green beans jiminey i could go on and on you ca nt go wrong here it is a chain restaurant but the owners have made it their own i love to go here ca nt go wrong
this place is very expensive and not something i can afford i only came because my dad took me for my birthday i loved my food
mmm dirty hipster bars let me count the ways in which i love you you are cheap lrb we had stellas rrb you are interesting lrb local art on the walls that i m told changes regularly rrb you are full of pretension lrb people watching is always worth the price of admission rrb you are friendly lrb like minded souls can smell each other out rrb if you are in the roosevelt district i highly recommend stopping in for happy hour its cheap and hipstery both words have been used to describe me so i am naturally predisposed to this place
finally decided to try out fuego tacos and was extremely disappointed that i did nt come sooner first i have to say that matt lrb our waiter rrb was awesome attentive nice accommodating and friendly i say this because it is just about opposite of my experience everywhere else i go i just assumed that it s normal for your waiter to be snarky and ignore their customers he seems to prove that theory wrong i m usually cheap and give out only a   tip for the usual lack of service i receive but matt earned the full awesome just does nt come close to describing the meal it started with the salsa and chips and kept going all the way through dessert i know it s usually chips an salsa but the real star there is the salsa so you have to say it first ordered a carne asada quesadilla which came dressed with a chipotle dipping sauce the quesadilla was great by itself and extreme when complimented with the chipotle dip wife and i shared both the pernil lrb pork rrb and shirt rib barbacoa lrb beef rrb tacos either way you choose it it s a great dish although i did like the short rib tacos slightly better than the pork the tacos come with sides of both rice and black beans i ve made black beans before and they do nt even compare like trying to compare a huffy bicycle to a ducati motorcycle  they just do nt our meal was followed up with a slice of cake covered with a mango and pineapple reduction i will definitely be back sooner rather than later expect to pay about  per plate after tax  tip a few more if you order drinks apps and  or dessert if you ve read any of my other reviews you might just know that i m driven by good food with a great value and as such you can find usually grab a deal on lrb choose one rrb for on yelp  groupon or off from restaurantcom  yes i did use a deal for myself while normally you can feel the glares of the wait staff whenever you pull out your coupon matt made us feel like it was no big thing and was happy to serve us i had such a good experience that i might even consider  gasp  coming without a coupon   gasp

ladies and gentlemen we have a winner i saw this place while driving a friend home i hooked a sharp right to get into the parking lot not even thinking i might hit a car i am a wing man i love wings i will eat the shit out of wings i have nt really found a place that have the whole package until now i ordered for me and my family wings lrb garlic pepper and honey habenero rrb a piece catfish dinner lrb which was enough for people rrb fried mac n cheese kids meal and honey biscuits where do i start  first off we did nt eat there i brought it home i thought it would loose flavor and quality by the time i got it home it did nt they did an amazing job packaging it everything was packaged separate so no food touched another food that included the fries that came with it even the fries lived the honey biscuits are out of this world amazing gooey goodness i will order a bunch of those for thanksgiving if i have to the garlic pepper wings were some of the best wings i have ever had in my entire life the seasoning was a dry rub they tasted nothing like i ve ever tasted before the honey habenero were not as hot as i would have imagined but the flavor was top notch my wives catfish was amazing the breading and seasoning was perfect i think i know why everything tasted so good the cooks behind the counter knew that preparing the food was not a race they took their time and made sure everything came out at the same time and went the extra mile to make sure they did it right everyone who worked behind the counter were so polite and informative they let my know how my order was coming almost every minute i dropped the catfish it will take minutes to cook then i ll sauce the wings meanwhile someone was bagging up all the condiments and sides so they were ready to go before the food was ready i could tell by all the metal bowls and sauce containers with handwritten labels everything is made in house and from scratch nothing looked like it was ordered from a supplier they took ingredients and made it from scratch the price was reasonable and the portions were amazing my wife took the other half of her catfish to work with her bottomline i will return i will support this company i will tell my friends about it please go here and enjoy it
i m noticing a trend in my recent reviews caffeine best mocha i ve had bar none of course i still love miss lola and lux but if cartel were closer to home lrb or the downtown location was open on sunday rrb i d be here all the time the wait is long no matter what time you come stop whining deal with it or go to starbucks so i do nt have to wait so long the decor is cool the location is hidden and there is an abundance of chicks with mullets and dudes with neck beards neither of which bother me i had a strange verbal exchange with a barista that left me confused but i think that was due to my foggy sunday morning state i have nt experienced the snarky attitude that others have made mention to and i m pretty in tune with that sort of thing some would say overly so one more thing worth mentioning is that the music is at a decibel level that it s not a nightmare trying to hold a conversation lrb take note lux rrb as a matter of fact i could hear the hilariously awkward conversation next to me that s always fun
my first star review this place has the best pho i ve ever had not best in az best ever the soup is really greasy and they even place a large slab of fat in the mix of beef but that s probably why it tastes so good really big portions for the price too the super size  is absolutely gigantic when i m not in the mood for pho i usually get their barbecue beef over rice which is also amazing their desserts are interesting to try and a nice way to get rid of that greasy beefy taste in your mouth cheap at too this place has really cleaned up over the years getting nicer tables and a generally cleaner dining area not quite the hole in the wall when i first tried this place almost a decade ago service has always been fairly fast and friendly at one point i used to come here almost once a week with my family and the server remembered us and our orders every time the only bad thing i can think of is their sandwiches are fairly disappointing and it s a half hour drive to get here for me but it s worth it every time
market street toffee is the best i am not a big sweet fan but i could eat anything they make and love it i can not get over their choclate chip cookies they are th best cookies in the whole world
in a nutshell this place is awesome frigging awesome since i work close to here i typically have a lot of the same crappy ass options for lunch that i get sick of original hoagie challenges these crappy options and comes out the victorious winner like tom berringer in the movie sniper when he knows he just owned his enemy i would come to this place more than once a week if i made more money than i do it is just one of those places i will give this place my official nfa rating lrb no fucking around rrb here is my typical experience when i come here now i have tried about  things off the menu here in my visits or so and they are all awesome fresh ingredients lettuce does nt taste like water meat does nt taste like carl budding soft bread lrb god the bread here damn rrb and kick ass service my regular item takes a few minutes longer than the typical sub the owner sees me in line has them start making it before i even order it so i do nt have to wait as long afucking plus let s talk about the owner shall we lrb i assume might be the manager not sure but he is always running the cash register rrb this guy is awesome and i hate people he always asks how my days is going making small talk etc if i have nt been in for a while he says things like been a while since i have seen you how have you been  come back more often he is the guy taking orders every time i have been there since i am not a huge fan of soda he always gives me a good size ice water and does nt bitch about it or charge me for a cup that charging for a cup thing is horse shit and nonexistent at this place by the way no fee for using a debitcredit card either i almost always use cash but a plus for you card users the restaurant is always clean tables are free of garbage and left over food they always have the daily newspaper to read and i have never been pushed out of there if i read it after my meal is over the place does nt smell of burned bread or rotten meat either like a lot of other sandwich shops if i had to make a complaint it would be that there is no bathroom here for customers the place is small and probably lacks the resources for it plus i bet it would piss off the health department if they knew customers were walking through the food prep area to wash their hands which is why it does nt happen know this before going there and pissshit and wash your hands beforehand and the bullet has been dodged if these instructions are too hard for you then i assume natural selection will eventually pay you a visit anyway i look for any way to cut down a business and with this place i really ca nt find one ca nt ding a star for their shitter lrb or lack of rrb if you are in the area and want a good meal decent price lrb about  bucks more than the crappy national chains but after you eat you know where that money went rrb and good quick service than give this place a try i found it by accident a few years ago and it was one of the best fuck up s i have had from a food point of view you are clear to engage the original hoagie shop weapons hot
this place is so cute and shabby i am already a huge fan of vintage stuff and now i am happy to have found a new paper arts resource that satisfies my vintage shopping urges in my area of town not only are the prices cheap but i always find so many different scrapbook and artsy things when i shop here it s not a big place but it s in a small area of the brass armadillo and so worth the visit when i do nt get to visit mystic paper in mesa i already love shopping at the brass armadillo so this scrapbook shop inside of it is a total bonus
i ve been to the grapevine twice and love it whether you re sitting on the upstairs patio near the bar or downstairs in the openair restaurant lrb do nt worry  there s still plenty of shade rrb it s relaxing and more importantly delicious i recommend the lahvosh which is a type of pizza made on armenian cracker bread yum i will say if you do nt like birds you may not enjoy sitting there the birds are nt really afraid of humans anymore and tend to hop around the vine design at the side of the lower section or on the ledge of the upstairs patio they will also come inside the lower section and hop around on empty tables etc the upstairs patio also has a wonderful view of camelback mountain
my new favorite burger joint i got my lrb made to order rrb burger fast and it was better than i had imagined hot greasy and tasted like a million bucks the service was great too when i said fry s they did nt mistake that for sprite lol i am most def a fan
i m not close to jamaican nor am i an expert in their culture but i do know how much love i have for their items my boy brian t lrb below rrb got a door hanger for this new jerk chicken spot close to home and was telling me all about it as we were sipping some mojitos at rumbar with the owner of rb well of course he chimed in and the of them decided to tell me that i needed to try it stat next day off i went for lunch walked in right as they opened and was immediately greeted by lrb i assume rrb the owner extremely nice man he was filling the cooler up with water and his young daughter was helping out his mom lrb i know cause he said mah rrb rung me up and lrb i assume again rrb his wife made me my food is there anything better then supporting a local family owned and operated business that also has star food and service  nope jerk chicken was nt dry was nt too spicy lrb the hotter the better just like all things in life  rrb the location looks dicey but use the back door vip style and your set up for the promise land quick convenient tasty and all under a polite roof so good
love this place the staff is awesome and always have the best suggestions
sooo much better then other locations i scored a pair of paradigm bookshelf speakers for they are in perfect condition and retailed for lol
i try and eat here regularly hummus is great very personable staff and the atmosphere is awesome look forward to the next time
this place is amazing great place to bring a group of friends food is exceptional the portions are very small and it is a little pricy but from a scottsdale restaurant i expect no less i had the mai mai tacos and they were just so full of flavor beer battered fish with an array of spices cooked to perfection their guacamole is superb absolutely to die for and coming from southern california that says a lot the pumpkin bread pudding was exquisite it had a cinnamon butter type of sauce and it made my taste buds fall in love service our servers were great wonderful happy peopled that really seemed to enjoy there job bartenders as well were super nice everyone was very hospitable and made our group feel very welcomed atmosphere this restaurant is gorgeous old mission style on the outside modern fancy art decor inside with subtle mission feel inside as well the patio outside was beautiful we had a fan that kept all of us cool and was not too loud everyone in our group of six had a blast and i will recommend this place to everyone who visits scottsdale
ca nt give a review accidental check in no pun intended
i love ocean blue one of my favorite places to go the food is reasonably priced and very healthy i recommend it to anyone especially those who have a sweet tooth while possibly trying to find yummy lower calorie foods
i have nt met a donut i did nt like here at rainbow donuts the oldfashioned donuts chocolate bars and french crullers are my favorites they even make croissant breakfast sandwiches which also hit the spot on the mornings that we come here do nt bother with dunkin donuts if you want authentic donuts at great prices the service has always been great and the young lady who works here is always smiling rrb
i really love this gym it is so nice and well maintained there is always plenty of towels to grab before a workout the childcare is excellent and has the security part down when you sign up as a member you and your child are given assigned wristbands to use during visits the staff have always been good about ensuring the numbers on them match prior to releasing my child to me you can even tune into the cameras to watch your child on the tv s that are on the cardio equipment childcare is also open days a week and doesnt close for lunch like most gyms there is also plenty of group classes throughout the day if you are into zumba or cycling etc i recommend this gym to anyone especially parents needing quality childcare
trendy colorful flavorful busy very popular place with a lot of selections do nt forget to get your parking validated
i love charlie s now that i ve gotten that out of my system i will repeat how much i love charlie s the drink specials are awesome i do nt come here for the liquor though i come here to have a couple cold beers and dance the small pitchers on sunday are just right for the end of my weekend the best part about this place is the crowd there is no pretension just a bunch of regular guys and girls there to have a good time everyone is friendly and i ve never had a bad experience i ve been to the charlie s in vegas as well and had just as wonderful a time if you ever come across charlie s wherever you may be go in and say hi you ll be glad you did now ride em cowboy

this has to be the friendliest dive bar i ve ever entered the husband hates karaoke and we still had fun here we saw no drama no showoffs no meanness just a bunch of people on a saturday night having a good time the people here were absolutely gracious and friendly i felt completely welcomed and encouraged to have the best time possible during my visit i almost never sing karaoke because i m bad but i sang two songs and received a ton of applause after both songs if you re a singing godgoddess come and have fun but this is nt a talent showcase the patrons were dancing to the songs and having a good time regardless of the ability of the singer and i was patiently waiting to use the ladies room when a gentleman asked if i would feel comfortable using the men s room because it was open i told him i would nt mind if i could lock the door or have someone stand outside to prevent someone from walking in he stayed outside and waited for me to finish so nice i will be back to this bar
my very very favorite hike in the valley i love flat iron the scenery and theme of this trail change quite a bit making it super fun to climb up it you probably should be a little bit experienced to hike this trail in decent shape also make sure you bring enough water i bring  fl oz in my camelback and that s enough

review  i knew i was coming up to the century mark here on yelp and i ve been trying to think of what i d want my hundredth to be something different for sure but i just was nt coming up with anything then on some random night kristen and i head out to ted s hot dogs and there i see it completely unassuming and somewhat hidden a sign that reads beaver choice remembering seeing it on yelp a bit lately i ask if we can she nods and we re off beaver choice is one of those culinary miracles that i m so glad i stumble upon occasionally and i knew as soon as i left that it must be the illusive hundredth review from the moment we walked in we felt like family i m a little surprised i did nt end up getting a hug the people who run the establishment are bright and chock full of attitude quirky attitude if you do nt have a lot of experience with people from different nations you could possibly see some of it as rude just toughen up people unless you re doing something silly all they want to do is serve you well the atmosphere is nothing amazing this is not the palm but it is very homey it feels like you re walking into someones dining room a lot of the furniture and dining accessories are from ikea which is cute because it s from sweden and they have a bunch of games you can play while you wait they are nt trying to pretend they re a quick restaurant everything is fresh and can take a while the food the food is amazing everything i ve had from the coleslaw to the potatoes to the meatballs has been wonderful i wholeheartedly recommend the pork schnitzel cordon bleu this thing was so simple and tasty it s not some oversauced or overseasoned dish it s fresh quality food that speaks for itself without being covered up by a million ingredients also high on the list are the supremely flavorful swedish meatballs get a chunk of meat on your fork plow it through the potatoes then dip it in the lingonberry preserve and let me know how heaven was the coleslaw is not your typical slaw it is house made and much better the thyme potatoes came in a huge portion and were delish and the tomato basil salad was tasty even to a guy who hates tomatoes like me i m not sure how much more i could drool over this place huge portions very good food fair pricing and amazing staff beaver choice just has it all
 i m no food critic but this place is amazing i has the salmon dinner tonight and it was fabulous the gourmet pizzas are also amazing but my most favorite item at the cider mill is the honey weiss beer you gotta have one and then get the history on this particular hand crafted beverage outstanding service vicky the chef is extremely experiences definitely worth the money here them go to the pantry next door this is a bonus thanks guys
boba tea house is one of the few teaboba joints in az it is in the shopping plaza where lee lee market is at on the corner of warner and dobson boba tea house is about a minute commute from my place but i try to make a visit at least once a month i am used to having at least boba locations within most cities in southern and northern california my favorite flavor is almond milk tea and i use the natural tea taste with the mixture of almond flavor to see quality of the boba drink you can taste the natural tea flavor and the sweetness of the almond is not overpowering the tea taste i like that they have other addons such as lychee the location is pretty cool like a small cafe with modern decor i have spent time just chilling at their couch and the music is not too loud for a good conversation
if you do nt know about dillard s then i m not telling you
yummmmmmmmmm i frequent calabria for my italian sandwich fix about once a month i get the sicilian which is a variety of italian cold cuts in the the tastiest loaf of bread in town lrb sorry willow rrb maybe it s bc it reminds me of the italian grocer lrb on a much smaller scale rrb that my nonna used to take me to but nonetheless  this sandwich is divine defalco s is good and has more of a larger grocer selection but the bread at calabria is much better tasting and the sandwich itself is more authentic tasting prices run pretty high for a sandwich but it is huge and i suggest you just get oil and vinegar on it worth every red cent you gotta try it
locally owned by great people yummy lattes and live music and game night what more could you want  this place really goes out of their way to offer more than the standard coffee experience when the owner found out it was our first time there she went out of her way to tell us all about their nightly events give us an extra punch on our first card and make sure we knew about their specialty drinks considering they re in the same parking lot with a starbucks you know they have to be offering something special to stay in business support the locals go to gold bar
small simple fresh limited perfect not your average joes just watch out for the scene

i went today saturday the th we saw the races first and loved it then we went to the petting zoo that had lots of goats water buffalo long hair cattle with the horns and a texas long horn all close enough to touch and pet then we watched the dock dogs competition and that was so much fun too after all that we ate ostrich jerky kangaroo burger aligator on a stick deep fried pickles cookie dough onion rings and snickers it was such a good time i will be making this a yearly tradition for my family we all had a great time i recommend it especially for a family with little kid s took my three kids and they just loved it parking was and each food item was an average of it was to get in for the adults and we had coupons to get the kids in free
i never write these things but i have to say that you will not be disappointed with paletas betty especially with the weather right now it is a delicious and healthy treat made with seasonal ingredients i highly recommend the limn amarillo when in season delicious frozen lemondadelemon drop on a stick tossed in a sugar rub it is for certain served in heaven that is all ps check out the hours yo you know what s up
i love this cafe its near work and they have a great selection of lunch items and there is a pond outside you can sit at quick service too they always have a lunch and breakfast special always unique and great i had a roast beef wrap with green chili s on it was delicious and i had chicken breast sandwich on sour dough with green chili s and sometimes i get omelettes its very friendly and they have lots of beverages and different coffees its a good spot and quick they have big tables area couches magazines its good spot to wait on someone in the building or take a friend to lunch if you work nearby
the pizza here is like what i used to have at giordano s in chicago this is the heir apparent the cheese is great the sauce incredible and a great crust this was my birthday dinner and will be for years to come
walking into arrogant butcher will instantly increase your swank level by at least  seriously this modern chophouse by sam fox puts a sexy spin on nouveaunostalgic and trendy flair on classic american fare in typical fox fashion plus it s located in the heart of downtown phoenix which is on the verge of a full blown revival and right on the lightrail which makes it terribly convenient for anyone who lives in the area the handcrafted cocktails were quite impressive i m all over house made mixers vintage spirits and super fresh ingredients that translate into something really sublime in every sip do nt miss the bourbon infused  candlestick maker and if you re in the mood for something sensational and eclectic look no further than the heavenly gin and chartreuse laced cocktail dubbed  the last word indeed for the softopening we attended the service was spot on actually more like exceptional and the food they served up followed closely behind we sampled the mussels in wine sauce with spicy pork shoulder with pomme frites lrb that s fancy for french fries rrb crab stuffed chicken skirt steak and grilled swordfish with artichokes hearts although slightly salty and somewhat expected it was still flavorful delicious and very satisfying yes fox is a somewhat of local restaurant giant and arrogant butcher does have a decidedly chain vibe to it but why so serious downtownmidtowncenpho elitist diner  it s a chain vibe in the best sense of the term it really was an overall a fantastic and festive experience definitely joining the ranks of lively new downtown establishments i plan to frequent often look for me at the bar cocktail in hand swag in full effect thank you very much
great food and great people
this place is wonderful the staff is very nice and friendly and they do a great job on the nail art it is also the best deal in town i have yet to find a better price on nails and waxing if you go monday tuesday or wednesday you receive an extra  iff the already low prices i have been going to this nail shop for years and it is the best
wonderful flavors in the meat and fish tacos well seasoned  a winner we will be back plus great service
do taco jedis work at senor taco  yes yes they do is the force of making killer fast mexican food strong with these jedis  oh hell yeah try the shredded beef tacos in the hard shells when they ask you if you want hot sauce say  si and drizzle it mightily onto the tacos piled cheese beef lettuce tomatoes all stuffed into an authenticstyle taco shell  it does nt get any better than this just make sure you put a helmet on because it s crazy good if you like spicy nononsense burritos go with the carne asada burrito lrb red chile rrb if you like the whole meal go with the carne asada or pollo asado burrito combo plates the plate comes with flour tortillas beans and rice guacamole and salsa fresca you make your own burritos this is just good eatin take it home crack open a good hefeweizen and you are golden and lastly from the sage words of my wife the shrimp tacos and burritos are certified gourmet meals do i stutter  nope while senor taco is technically  fast food it does take some time to prepare if you do drivethru do nt get all road ragey if it takes longer than it does at taco bell there is a price to pay to make good food and that price is time this is not a worldwide chain that spends more on advertising and earning your business by putting cute little dogs on plastic mugs senor taco is not that type of place a little wait is very much worth it i realize that appearance of the location irks some reviewers yes it is in a strip mall yes it is  feet away from a gas station slash ampm mini market i get that but this is not sanctuary this is not kai this is not deseo when one reviewer lrb and i use the word  reviewer loosely here rrb hilariously claims to have walked in used his superman vision to supposedly spot a family of offending microbes and lrb without trying the food rrb proceeded to sprint out because he was frightened of all the imagined cooties well i just have to laugh that s not a review it s a driveby and reviewers like this are probably happier with hometown buffet or luby s cafeteria and that s too bad because this is excellent fast food i ve eaten here maybe  times and my wife has ordered the fish taco plate a number of times and neither of us has ever gotten sick the people at senor taco are nice the food pleasantly surprises and your expectation of fast mexican food will be forever changed for the better i ca nt recommend highly enough
might need a step program for this place came for lunch yesterday and brought the family back for breakfast everything was so good took a few more and some cream cheese to go ca nt wait to come back for the rueben exit b on the parkway lrb it s a jersey thing rrb
i found her on yelp and could not resist to see what everybody was talking about prices were very reasonable alison is awesome designed postcards and new business cards in a day i could have not thought of anything better she has a real talent
my dspot   rrb where i can decompress after an intense work day not to mention the best cup of matcha in town thanks don
very cool little restaurant i imagine it would be very easy to drive right past this place no sign i ordered the grilled baguette lobstah mac and cheese and the daily special fish and chips my boyfriend and i shared each plate everything was delicious the olive oil served with the baguette was so delicious  complex and grassy the lobstah mac and cheese definitely delivered on the lobstah the fish and chips was a nice surprise  tender moist cod and thickcut chips we were there during happy hour and i ordered the sunbru michelada i ca nt believe this drink got me to enjoy beer i never drink beer in all this was a great place
i went with my hubby today for lunch  had to write my review as soon as i got back to work i have to admit this place intrigued me because of the mention yelp  receive  off offer and i am so glad i decided to try it out fuego bistro is hidden away inside an older looking complex the inside is very small but they do have additional space in the patio out front our waitress suzie i believe was very sweet she was very good about refilling our drinks  asked how everything was for my entree i ordered their signature empanadas  for my hubby s entree he ordered the fuego enchiladas both came with a side of rice  black beans the empanadas were so delicious there were so many flavors going on it was amazing hubs said his enchiladas were delicious as well some of the best he s ever had i had to order the captain morgan banana burrito for dessert even though it was lunch time i am so glad i did it was one of the best desserts i ve ever had  i am a dessert junkie they have a rather large bar for such a small space so i definitely want to come back for happy hour  dinner sometime this is my new favorite place
fantastic i m a displaced ny italian and was dismayed until i found the queen creek olive mill i honestly did nt expect to find decent olive products here in az i was very impressed with the product quality the selection is pretty diverse too i tried some of the food at the bistro counter and was also impressed by the quality and presentation very tasty the staff is knowledgeable and helpful
stopped in looking for some break from the heat after a couple hours shopping they have a happy hour menu that we tried several dishes from and all were very good menu also has a good selection of alcoholic drinks nut we stuck to ho hydration instead staff and management were very attentive would definitely recommend
fnb is that rare restaurant that poses the most difficult of all reviewer dilemmas try to keep it a secret hoping to always get a lastminute table or let the world know serving the greater good of diners everywhere well being an altruistic person  i ate dinner at fnb friday night my th time fresh local ingredients inventive but accessible recipes perfect execution lovely service i ve eaten my way through most of the menu and ca nt find fault with a single item of particular note the panna cotta with mulberries and kumquats is sublime do nt even think of sharing it this dish is everything a dessert should be a little bit of heaven reserve well ahead of time and sit at the bar if you can and watch the food being prepared try a vegetable that you do nt think you like  fnb will change your mind
i ve been dr castilla s office for years her office has relocated and her practice has grown over the years and for good reason she is a dr that treats you as a person and takes her time to honestly answer your questions she makes eye contact with you and i could nt ask for anything more just remember it is a large practice and the staff is sometimes questionable but she s worth the wait now that we ve relocated i hate to give up dr castilla she s irreplaceable
i got the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon a wise decision indeed the bacon is some of the most delicious i have had in a long long time  cut so thick you almost needed a knife being from the deep south i can certify that this was legitimate authentic gravy made with the requisite amount of care rich smooth and savory  i ca nt say enough good things about it eggs and hash browns were both very fresh and perfectly cooked my girlfriend had an omelet that had some of the most amazing tender and flavorful ham evidently the ham is made fresh in house  it really does make a big difference the taste is exceptional all in all a wonderful place for breakfast or brunch
woohoo yes it is that good a trip to melrose is not just another errand fantastic people prices are as good as a corporate pharmacy so many good points but the best about melrose is simply that they make you feel special that is enough for me one other thing it smells like an oletime pharmacy
when an experience is perfect i ve gotta give it five stars the hostess waitress and chef we re friendly and helpful i had a caprese sandwich they bake their own pannini rolls fresh every morning this is a winner
i m a big fan of small and local business and i must admit i felt a little protective when i saw a fox concepts restaurant going up in my own neighborhood i finally decided to try it with a friend and i have to say it s a wonderful addition to current arcadia offerings i stopped by ahead of time to grab a menu to peruse and i was immediately excited because i saw that if my first visit was good i d have to do about more to sample everything that caught my eye when i see italian i brace myself for more of the same old pastas and sauces but this menu has a lot of variety and it includes seasonal offerings lrb which as a nutritionist is important to me rrb i tried a farrokale salad and would order it again lrb on trip after trying everything else rrb my friend and i sat on the patio which despite the cold night was packed the entire time we were there i do love the neighboring restaurants but it s nice to have a little bit of competition for inspiration so happy this is within walking distance for me valet parking is complimentary by the way for those who drive
gallo blanco had me at guacomole served poolside nonetheless spent a night at the clarendon after reading reviews about the hotel and gallo blanco attached and i was not let down breakfast was amazing delicious coffee and hands down the most delicious huevos rancheros i have ever had i also can vouch for the fish tacos the carne asada torta and again the guacomole so fresh loaded with cilantro and mango i think i consumed at least a half a dozen avacados oh and the bloody mary s rrb ahhhhhhhhh how i have fond memories of the bloody mary s the fresh dill really made them something special bravo for breakfast snacks poolside nosh and bloody mary s
this place saved my life i dropped my iphone and shattered the back side glass i thought there was no way to repair it i found these guys and called cj who really knows his stuff i came in and he took my phone gave me a great recommendation where to grab some lunch and by the time i was back my phone was repaired fast repair great price and great customer service thanks cj
so good and soooo cheap i love the turkey pesto or the strawberry cream cheese but honestly everything is great my kid orders off the menu a pb banana and bacon crepe yum
awesome place called in and told them we would be heading over and we were running late and they held the restaurant open for us until we got there truly nice people and great management i seriously recommend you go love their appetizers
there is none better this taco shop is off the beaten path hidden and mixed in next to a smoke shop and behind a circle k parking can be at a premium but the payoff is the food great friendly service low key on the inside and flavors and textures that rock your socks off i mean really my favorite taco shop in the valley or more to the point prob one of the best in the west the burros are as think as a mans arm the tacos are soooo good i especially like the chorizo the lingua is good the carne is excellent have a cane sugar coke in a bottle and find a seat inside or out you will savor the flavors and be sure to use the sides of grilled peppers and onions they make the meal for me now where to go for lunch 
i have been going to san tan for over a year now and have always been happy with the service food and beer this visit was no exception in fact the wait staff was so helpful and responsive when we arrived they moved tables to accommodate our group of shawna and martisse remembered our names throughout the evening even though all plus of us moved from table to table i can not think of one instance where an order was messed up i will continue to go and recommend this establishment to everyone
if you want some good food at a good price this is the place eating at many mexican restaurants this is by far my favorite the chicken enchiladas are good the beans the margaritas and the chicken mole not a swanky place that fits into the scottsdale area but just down right good food come here for the food the patio is quaint i like it here i have never sat inside and would not recommend it it feels cramped i live in denver now and wish frank and lupe s was here
such strange combinations of flavors yet they taste so good we ve been here three or four times and are never disappointed
we live around the corner but had never heard of fuego until groupon ran a special a couple months ago we finally got around to using our coupon tonight  so glad we did i ca nt believe that fuego seems to remain a wellkept secret it is really fantastic the guitar playersinger that was there this evening was great  such a nice surprise husband and i were greeted by the host upon our arrival i loved him what an awesome vibrant personality and he recommended a killer peachgrapefruit mojito  mmmm we shared the salmon croquettes empanadas and the delicious chicken dinner lrb i m sure it had a name rrb all of the dishes were presented beautifully had fantastic flavor and persuaded us to not only clean out plates but to order dessert too the side dishes of jalapeno creamed corn and green chile cornbread casserole were so good i would have ordered a dinner made up strictly of side dishes had that been an option the maplechili glazed carrots and chipotle mashed potatoes were also calling my name but they ll have to wait for my next visit we finished up with the horchata bread pudding yum i liked the contrasting texture of the fried and sugared flour tortilla strips on top during our meal we had fantastic service they took their time and we never felt rushed which is a change from many restaurants around town we really felt like we could sit back enjoy the music and chill as long as we wanted to i m looking forward to a return visit probably for happy hour very soon lrb how can you turn down those prices  rrb
traffic jam get in my face sooooooooooooooooo good i m a big sammich fan this is the place
i used to live next door to ted s and i had to have it at least once a week the hot dogs are fantastic the onion rings are delicious corn dogs are superb fries could be better though only downside they only accept cash so a er trip to the atm may be in order
once again very friendly people clean establishment and great food
we had a wonderful lunch on a saturday afternoon that was absolutely perfect great staff and no crowds so we enjoyed a quiet lunch indoors i tried the smoked trout salad w  goat cheese and a delicious balsamic dressing my friend had the brisket sandwich on toasted bread with onions  peppers we also split an order of their polenta cheese fries that were quite tasty with their accompanied sauce everything was delicious and very fresh if i had more of an appetite i would have definitely tried the cauliflower soup it sounded wonderful you can tell the chef takes great pains to make sure every dish is perfectly prepared and top notch the indoor seating is as delightful as the outdoor tables i ca nt believe i had nt found this little gem before it would be a great spot for a large group as well as an intimate meal thank you the house at secret garden
dr perno and his staff are the best i have ever experienced i went in to take care of teeth that all had multiple cavities he was extremely gentle and i never even felt the needle go into my gums let alone anything else not only did he do satisfactory work without causing me any pain he also gave me tips and hints as to how to better care for myself i felt that he truly cared about me as a patient and left feeling like i had known him my whole life even though this was my first time visiting i would recommend him to strangers and family members alike and will continue to use his services for as long as i can afford it thank you
i m writing this review from a comfie seat in the copper star cafe itself using its free wifi for a laptopwielding downtown resident like myself outlet accessibility is as important as wifi and this place gets the thumbs up the owner and staff are very friendly they seem genuinely delighted to see every customer walk in the place is fairly packed and i recognize the faces of at least two fellow downtown professionals as i sit here the coffee is good the scones are excellent the ambiance reflects exactly what i look forward to as the future of downtown phoenix scaled down unpretentious but urban  loftlike bricks and open ductwork given its proximity to my home i ll probably spend many weeknights here when i have late projects
i love this place my husband and i have been coming here for over a year the building and courtyard are very tastefully decorated the vines and foliage make me feel like i am eating in a garden  i love it i also love the fact that it is a set three course meal with a choice of two entrees for dinner believe it or not it is hard to chose between the two because they both sound so delicious indeed the food is delicious and consistently great christopher makes dinner look easy as a one man show in the kitchen it is truly amazing looking forward to our next dinner better plan soon whoever the person is below that gave two stars and was surprised by a corkage fee needs to get out of the house more often a corkage fee is standard for any byob
ca nt get enough of their pra ram the peanut sauce is unmatched we frequent this place regularly for weekday lunchtime specials it s a family run business with weird hours so make sure you call ahead before going well worth the trip though
i do nt understand why they have such a low rating i worked here for a quick minute my freshman year of college and i ate some damn good sammies during that time plus they re open late night for all the drunkos leaving the bars in downtown tempe you should be thanking silvermine and their broccoli cheese soup i wish there was one in orange county or los angeles  i m always at a loss when it comes to late night dining even pizza places stop delivering before infants go to bed here silvermine i back you
i m updating my review of feeney s as when i read the review of my initial visit i was sort of shocked it is now one of my favorite restaurants in phoenix first make sure you check out their website for the nightly specials wednesday night is particularly great with your choice of freshly prepared entrees including potato or vegetable and soup or salad for nice second when you check in on yelp look for the instant  off coupon immediately for that use not a  off after visits or a one time use every time nice third i am always a bit taken aback by the sincere friendliness of the staff especially the owner she always remembers us even when we have nt been for a few months and we are always greeted with a big hug and a hearty hello welcome back nice fourth the salad bar that i was unimpressed with in my first review impresses me now not for its variety but for its consistently fresh and always well stocked bounty not only leafy salads on the salad bar but some slaws a few pasta salad choices and lots of very fresh veggies and i m a sucker for the carrots that have been shaved into curls and the cool fresh ground pepper mill while you are getting your salad the chef lrb s rrb will routinely visit with you as the kitchen is right behind the salad bar nice on my visit last night i started with the onion rings as an appetizer they were good no flavorgasm like the ones at durant s but then how could they compete with those  i had the special salisbury steak with mashed potatoes and salad salisbury steak has been much maligned by the swanson tv dinners of old when done right and feeney s does it right it is a flavorful piece of ground prime steak here s a hint if they ask you how you want your salisbury steak cooked you pretty much know it is going to be better than the chopped steak meal you are going to get at other restaurants the mushroom gravy is an added treat for both the steak and the mashed potatoes another at the table subbed the fresh veggies for the potato and they were a nice assortment of zucchini squash and broccoli not a limp greasy garnish like you get some places if you opt out of the potato portion nice another hug upon our leaving goodbyes from the waiter and the bar staff you can easily see why most of people you see in feeney s are regulars count me as one now
this is my go to thai place so far on the west side cute little place inside people are always friendly and the food is delicious please do nt go here looking for chinese food there have been a couple times i ve overheard people asking them for items you d see at a chinese food place  i m sure they get it all the time and surprisingly they were nice about recommending dishes the food is super authentic and so far i ve liked everything i ordered the pork fried rice never disappoints and the larb gai was really good too even better is that the bill never hurts my wallet and i usually walk out with my extras i could nt finish
this place does it this place is absolutely wonderful local fresh ingredients great atmosphere excellent service delicious dishes great cheese beer and wine list if you want a really romantic dinner and want it to last go here your meal will probably last  hours i went here with my fiance for her birthday and we loved it we sat outside and enjoyed a course meal with drinks it is sort of pricey but completely worth it highly recommended
good reviews are easy to write stop reading this and just go eat there ok well i have visited this place for years now and do nt go anywhere else if i am in this area i like the chef s they are friendly and quick they speak pretty good spanish to me and but i do nt dare try to respond in japanese ha ha the value is phenomenal where can two people get miso soup salad beans tea ice cream and sushi rolls all for under  i ve tried the same at say sushi in my hometown of maricopa and ca nt do it for under or more for two all you can eat is available but i find that ordering individually is more economical great atmosphere for a quick lunch or a large party for dinner the waitresses are asian and i find that suitable for the restaurant some reviews on here complain about them i do nt have any issue with them they have always treated me nice and done their job well i will keep coming back
a cozy little dive with cheap beer and bartenders who know what s up this is nt the type of place you would take mom to for a holiday drink dingy dark and mysterious because you never know what your gonna get perhaps the bartender will be wearing a mickey mouse sweater and playing crosswords  maybe drunken men in there late s will be stumbling about playing pool  if you love to people watch and have a few good cheap beers with your pals check this spot out it might just be your new favorite dive
la bocca has definitely improved their service in the past few months the last time i was here i personally called over the manager and told him what a great job our waiter was doing and that i ve consistently noticed an improvement in service over my last few visits i come here a lot and love the bruschetta reverse happy hour ambiance and the pizza we also went here for new years eve and that was a great deal  we sat on the couch and watched all the mill ave madness from a safe distance i highly recommend this place and whenever i have visitors in town that want to see mill i usually take them here it also makes a great date spot by far my favorite spot on mill
we moved into the neighborhood about years ago and part of the reason i loved it was because of the dog park even though we did nt have a dog now we do and we love going there when it s not too hot outside the people i ve met are friendly and my dog has made a lot of dog friends there i ve never noticed it being dirty i feel like everyone i ve seen has picked up after their pets there s also a fenced in area which is nice the park is large i like to run around with my dog there too
thank you jen  mike for making what i expected to be a hard decision so easy my boyfriend and i will do all of our future shopping at this location whatever you need here ask for them jen is the store manager and mike was more than amazing they told us that not many people knew about this location and i promised i would change that make sure to post your awesome experience next i love my ring
the best happy hour ever great sushi too
this location has the best merchandise out of any be i ve been to so far of course they re not going to take your wet seal shirt from years ago deal with it when you look at their selection you know why they re so picky and yes some things could be a bit cheaper but when you find the smokin hot deals on the designer brands it s all worth it lrb i got a pair of true religions for rrb
amazing short rib tacos will be back soon
i introduced my friend to the wonders of innout today and felt the need to yelp about it their hamburgers are works of art would i love some more toppings like bacon or guacamole or fried onions  maybe but there is so much taste happening in the simplicity of the innout double double the best part is you can wolf down a burger and fries and not feel like you just swallowed a rock the feeling exhibited when you go to almost any other burger fast food joint and always ask for it animal style
fine coffee a unique yet inviting atmosphere and friendly customer service diamond in the rough i will certainly make my way back here my next time through the area
so because i am unrealistically optimistic and naive when it comes to alterations i waited until last weekend to take a bridesmaids dress to get altered for a wedding i m in in weeks i thought it would be a simple let it and i d be good to go but the first tailor i took it to insisted that the only thing that would get this dress to fit is to change the zipper back to a corset back which in addition to buying the fabric would have costed be in addition to getting the dress hemmed to cocktail length which would have run me total considering that i bought the dress for slightly more than that i was about to have a mental breakdown and decided to get a second opinion before deciding after a quick yelp search i found myself at aj tailors it s a small little shop and when i walked in she was helping a bridetobe in her gown so i just hung out until she was ready for me i tried the dress on and told her what the other shop told me and she said that she would nt even recommend doing a corset back that there was enough in the dress to let it out and that it was already at cocktail length for my height which is exactly what i needed to hear before i got too excited i asked about how much it would run me to do an impossible job and it was at the end of the day i just needed the dress to fit so it was a done deal she took some measurements and asked me to come back in a week i stopped in today tried on the dress and it fit like a glove i m not sure what her prices run for smaller projects but if i have another emergency project like this lrb which i hope is nt the case rrb i will definitely return
my favorite gay bar in phoenix great outdoor patio great indoor tvs with surround sound friendly staff fun clientele pool tables cheap drinks and i can wear anything i want  hell yes where do i sign up  it s as close to a gay cheers as you can get in phoenix and my costumes are always a hit service is excellent and always served with a smile i will stop in here from time to time to shoot a round of pool or two and always enjoy the experience you wo nt be disappointed unless you are young and hot and only want eye candy to look at this is a real men s bar not a twink club or meat market although hot guys do come in from time to time it s also friendly to all types not just gays this is one of the few places in phoenix that serves up food from time to time as well go here go now and go often it s that simple
i was very amazed by this place came to town thinking big deal watching a game in a dome boy was i wrong besides low prices for parking game tickets and food stadium is beautifully and a fun place to watch a game i recommend you to schedule a tour before the game especially if you have kids too bad the local fans do not support their team there were only at the game maybe were angels fans i will come back again
wonderful food fast service they manage the flow in and out so well the food is tasty with a great variety on the menu
best calamari in town and awesome service tokyo glow is a great drink super refreshing
this store no longer exists edit  changed to stars manawerx is under new ownership and is sharing a store for the time being with imperial outpost games in phoenix rumor is they may occupy the suite next door more as it develops
yes it s pricey so i got a membership yes the membership is pricey  but if you go frequently lrb and you ll want to with the hot summer months rrb you ll get your money s worth and then some the place is big enough that you can do different exhibits for each trip great place to take the grandparents to watch the kids in their element too
best mexican gourmet expensive made by a latino chef who knows what she s doing and where she comes from place in phoenix hands down from the guacamole and chips to their enchiladas and my personal favorite the cochinita pibil barrio cafe is a true gem to be experienced and enjoyed i have spent two birthdays there and it always makes me feel as though i have been transported back to mexico better yet they even have cocacola from mexico in a bottle the best this actually makes them look more down to earth and humble compared to other wannabe upscale mexican food places needless to say i am such a fan that i purchased one of their tshirts that say comida chingona because it really is badass food
amazing amazing amazing been there less than times due to living super far away but would be there every day if i could have nt had the fruit flavors but all the chocolate and nut ones are great had real gelato across the walk from treve fountain while in rome and this might just be better only complaint is one time i had a snotty high schooler helping me out but whatever the ice cream makes up for snotty kids delish
i come here for lunch at least once a week great food great prices great ambiance the menus are unique with a fabric cover and wooden carvings on it which i have nt seen before if you like thai food you ca nt go wrong with this place
he said i made dinner reservations and so i was nervous it was a dinner date to celebrate my birthday albeit days later and i was excited to try a new place a foodie always gets excited about new culinary adventures that is until he uttered the restaurant name crudo i sat there bummed he asked if i had heard of the place he was dying to try and i said yes lrb in a disappointed voice rrb why did nt my friend ask me where i wanted to go on my birthday i thought deciding not to ruin the night by sounding like a little brat i quickly changed my tune as soon as we parked in the lot outside the swanky la looking streetside facade we walked in the restaurant and i immediately felt calm perhaps it was the dark wood floors exposed ceiling or even the tranquil ambiance  i do nt know but what i do know is that i was excited to be there we were immediately taken to the dining area where she allowed us to choose the table of our choice we were then greeted by our kind waiter where she happily took us through the drink menu lrb offering up their mixologist s specialties should we not see something on the menu we d prefer rrb and explained to us the crudo dining experience the experience is not like many restaurants  at crudo your options include or courses crudo offers selections for each of its categories if you will crudoraw being the first followed up with mozzamozzarella then cottocooked and then grigliagrilled and lastly lrb the th rrb dolce which means dessert if you ve saved any room for it which is highly unlikely we had a hard time deciding lrb thankfully our waiter helped navigate based on both our preferences rrb but decided to split four courses as follows crudoraw  yellowtail  controne bottarga iitoi at lrb who knows what all that means but i do know i loved it and dreaded the last bite rrb mozzamozzarella  burrata  crisp pancetta vinaigrette and fresh arugula at cottocooked  mushroom  mozzarella truffle egg at grigliagrilled  short rib  grilled root veg shaved horseradish at it was just enough savory bites to leave me content and wanting to try more of what crudo offers one thing i do want to note is how our waiter informed us that since we decided to split four courses we would be charged at the a la carte price verse the course cost and she informed us at order time instead of leaving us shocked when the bill was dropped thank you i could nt have been more wrong about my initial thoughts on the drive to dinner that evening since that night i have been waiting for a reason to return and savor their ricotta risotto dumpling gnocchi and porkbelly dishes to name a few thank you crudo for proving me wrong and making a fan out of me and now anyone and everyone i recommend to your foodie loving establishment and to those who are on the fence about going to crudo because of the limited menu just go  you will love it
i love this place it s a big warehouse without prices on the merchandise you need to use the catalog to find prices everything is much cheaper than big box pet supply stores  you can bring your dog  you can not bring in your purse lrb they ll ask you to leave it in your car or in their cubby at the front desk rrb  you have to spend minimum  local shipping is cheap  parking is kinda sucky i do nt recommend bringing a big long bed truck
my new favorite thai place i have been searching and tried r cha jasmine cafe pink pepper and a couple other thai places in mesa and gilbert but nobody nailed it they have the best tom kha and the pineapple fried rice is out of control good clean and friendly awesome
this is a great place to eat authentic mexican food your server always bring out chips and salsa first thing while you look over the menu lrb salsa is spicy and really good rrb the dinner combos are very reasonable and you get a good portion size my boyfriend and i usually go once a week to eat here
fabulous the architecture is amazing and the hotel and grounds are decorated perfectly for the holidays the food is elegant sophisticated and perfectly done the brunch buffet is beautiful and flavorful with a nice variety of cold items the brunch is pricey starting at at least depending on which entree you select the buffet is included in the price of your selected entree the buffet on it s own is expensive but well worth the price it was a lovely treat for the holidays
nothing that i can add that has not already been said great value for an outstanding meal served with class and great attitude will be back again and again thanks for a great evening
my favorite italian food ever i m very picky and even pickier is my daughter and she in in love with the ravioli di nina just like her momma yummy rrb
love love loved it i ve had the opportunity to sample their food at local festivals but this was my first time to the restaurant seating options include inside and two patios  a louder one off of th street and a quieter on at the back of the restaurant we ordered the hummus and the chips were perfect accompaniments we also spilt the secret bbq chicken sandwich okay this is where i tell you that i am not a vegetarian but thought this was amazing also ordered a side of the curry past salad  good add on
i ve known beth for years and rrb she has more style in her pinky finger than almost any other woman in phx has in her whole wardrobe  rrb good on her for grabbing her dream by the balls and squeezing with this boutique
as a guy i have to say that the place looks very girlish it is a very cute place very modern and is somewhat of a gimmick to get people inside having said that i can see the attraction of this spot and definitely maybe somewhere to bring a date for dessert i went to this place this evening with friends because they wanted to have some frozen yogurt i happened to checkin on yelp and lo and behold a yelp deal popped up got a free yogurt because of it after my friend andy paid for his i had a small peppermint with raspberry toppings which was absolutely perfect i do recommend this place since it is in a great location it s a lovely place to go after a dinner with friends
this target never lets me down and it especially did nt let me down today after hunting high and low for chocolate covered pretzel sticks i found them here and the christmas elves are absolutely to thank for that
i just went to the bar to meet some friends for happy hour after work and we could ve stayed all night the bartender was awesome very attentive made a great mojito and funny as hell the happy hour special were decent nothing amazing but the people watching was good mostly conventioneers swirling in and out for a cocktail before dinner the ambience was nostalgic and warm and there was a an old war movie playing on a projector screen in the lounge to the side of the bar i like this hotel bar for starting a night out if you re in downtown and are not in the mood for all the celebrity owned sports bars
my children and i had the pleasure of taking this tour with tim and a great aussie family this otherwise long hour ride was fun and entertaining tim kept us interested by providing us with tons of facts about az and joking with us the whole way we stopped for lunch at the indian reservation and did some light shopping the grand canyon was spectacular and tim was so accommodating taking our pictures along the way tim was the highlight of the trip he provided the visiting australian family with tips on visiting sedona and showed us some great things along the way he had a supply of water he kept encouraging us to drink my daughter left our camera in the car and he graciously returned it that very night thanks tim and southwest for providing us with a great experience
if you want excellent coffee an interesting but off the wall conversation that is completely politically incorrect and a great time with interesting knicknacks to buy this is your place john sagasta the owner formerly of sagasta coffee is a great barista and can talk about anything bring your taste buds and an open mind and you ll have fun no matter what
terrific place two words chai latte delicious best coffee drink i ve ever had the clucker breakfast sandwich is awesome too eggs ham lrb or bacon or sausage rrb and cheese on a bagel is elevated to sublime by juicy tomato and peppery arugula we have also gotten ice cream there the mint chocolate chip was very tasty with nice delicate mint flavor overall a very cute place with exceptional coffee and food
if you like good food nice people and really good food then you have to goto dd s i heart double d s too and you will once you eat here i had the caprese with salami and orzo salad with a dad s orange soda perfect they gots tons of salads and take home dishes one huge cheese case and another for the desserts they also have spices wine and beers the best beers are the ones in the cans btw apparently they will be opening a kiosk at the airport in a bit with some other local restaurants good food at the airport
so we have violet she was truly a puppy stray that we picked up in claypool az with mange nice huh  dr shure is so good with her she loves him and let him pull are you listening  pull a tooth with no sedation he knew it was wonky and would come out easily and he did nt even freakin charge us for it who does that  go go i send all my clients there and they re all satisfied
i am in love with this mountain i have a great time every time we go it is a challenge and steep in the beginning but totally doable take some water music and camera you have to take a pic of the city when you make it to the top
we were greeted with very friendly staff we had the fried knocci for an appetizer with a fabulous marinara sauce  usually do not order knocci but these came recommended and were very good the bread was crusty on the outside  chewy on the inside  very yummy we sat at the bar as we usually do and the bartender brought over a sample of their meet sauce to try with more bread i do nt eat meat sauce but my husband said it was very good i had a heft cosmo  my husband had a beer for dinner i had the pasta trio that was fabulous  probably the best italian food i ve had since the cioppino at allesia s restaurant my husband had the linguine with white clam sauce also very good i m certain these pasta dishes were homemade because they just had amazing flavor  i wanted more we finished with tiramisu that was also really great my husband had coffee and even that was great a little pricey in my opinion for italian food but due to how great all of it tasted  we think it was worth it this will be a definite dining destination in the future
so two vegetarians walk into a steak house lrb stop me if you ve heard this one rrb and had the best meal ever of course we would nt be so bold as to go to a steak house without a couple of carnivores with us one of whom was celebrating a milestone birthday a steak dinner was his dream of a dinner so we could nt deny the birthday boy server derek was on point the entire night he did nt even roll his eyes when i said okay the gig is up of us at this table are nt going to eat meat but we re trying as many of the sides as we can the meat eaters had of the finest most perfectly cooked ny strip steaks they were cooked medium rare and almost did nt need the steak knife sides included sauteed parmagiano asparagus  caramalized squash  mac and cheese  chopped salad  and pureed yukon gold potatoes with vermont butter even though we were so full we shared chocolate toffee cake for dessert lrb birthday boy got a special dessert of his own rrb dessert wine or a lovely glass of year old single malt scotch it was nt even my birthday but if sure felt like it was
best burger in arizona bar none unique setting as well very plain and rustic
great upscale casual food at a reasonable price we a few blocks away and visit this place often we have never had a bad meal the service is always great i would recommend sitting at the bar where you will have the pleasure of meeting their wonderful bartender ryan he is very friendly and always in a great mood they have a very nice patio with a fireplace
mm m mmmmmm a hour drive thru serving up my fast food favorites it is conveniently located and despite the questionable hygiene of the crowd that streams through here this restaurant is very clean another plus is that they have a double drivethru and extremely efficient and polite employees to go along with it i never have to wait for my food very long at all
anyone know why they closed  great bbq chicken the chicken katsu is pretty darn good too the staff is friendly and they work hard to get orders out fast because at times this place can get super busy there are very few places to sit in or outside of the restaurant and even standing in line can get more than a little cramped but put up with the lack of space and you ll be happy once you re eating some delicious island cuisine
i live in california and i do nt have the luxury to eat at the cracker barrel i recently returned to the mesa location which i visited years ago and i once again pleased my soul and body with their sublime food this time i visited for breakfast something i ve never done before i ordered coffee hashbrown casserole fried apples and a biscuit i knew the cracker barrel would never let me down and this time it was great as usual this place really deserves stars all the way the cracker barrel should be named the official restaurant of the nation
went here before a show at stand up live the happy hour had blue moon s for the frozen margaritas are our favorite i got the chicken parm which i think was better than carrabba s wife got a burger for some reason but said she loved it a little better than joe s farm grill we had a great time with an attentive waiter we ca nt wait to go back parking tip eating at a restaurant gives you a two hr validation while stand up live gives a three hr window we only parked for less than hrs but they will only accept one block of hrs for free so we had to pay the way to avoid it would be to pull out of garage and then right back in to get a new parking pass for the comedy show
nd time here and second time the food has been great i think i previously gave it a because i thought it was a little pricey but i m upgrading it to a because i think it s worth it
we had to stay here because of a missed flight but it was such a great deal for such a great hotel there was free food drinks and transportation every staff member there was so incredibly nice especially eugene who takes care of transportation the rooms are very nice as well i would stay here again if i were ever in phoenix
use is the best review  i am in cartel around times per week the coffee ca nt be beat they roast their own beans in house lrb that s what the giant locomotivelooking thing in the corner is rrb and grind the beans immediately before preparing each hot coffee or espresso they use the clover coffee brewing machine which brews each cup of coffee individually and automatically their iced coffee is a concoction called toddy which i like to call crack because of its high caffeine content and extremely economical price this is coldbrewed for hours and is also delicious so short of starting their own coffee plantation in their backyard cartel has the entire process  roasting to grinding to brewing  inhouse while most other coffeeshops only handle the grinding and brewing aspects there is something to be said for freshly roast coffee i just ca nt say it because my fingers are flying across the keyboard too fast their selection of coffees is amazing at s  s i could never tell the difference between their coffee varieties and was skeptical that any difference could actually exist in that kind of corporate environment cartel puts them to shame with the multiplicity of flavors found in one cup of huehuetenango lrb guatemalan rrb much less their brazilian salvadorian and lrb new rrb ethiopian varieties best of all many are directtrade and organic meaning they come from a farmer that the owners of cartel have personally met and made a deal with the atmosphere is fantastic as long as you can drop out of the speedy american mindset  and if you do nt mind the more generic side of indiepop rock come here for a date a long computing session lrb free wifi rrb or to relive your european caf experience  the coffee might even be better
hidden gem i found this place on yelp and so glad i checked it out this morning the food and coffee were great and the prices are so low the staff was very friendly and made great suggestions for us i am already planning on going back tomorrow to try something else
well let me start by saying that the minute i called and talk to john lrb he is the owner rrb i knew right away i would be a customer for life a matter of fact i told him that very thing because his knowledge of air conditioning systems is second to none folks and that is why i will be a customer for life i did nt have any work done personally myself but my wife did and when i called to talk to him i felt like he was an old friend whom i could trust with one my most valued possessions which are my trucks lol so here is the real story i took my chevy colorado to fletcher s auto and i was told there was no problem with the ac resistor or blower fan which i pretty much knew already however there was an issue with the ac body control module because the unit was not grounded properly so no power was getting to the module so the guy at fletcher s told me he did nt have the equipment to fix the problem which required the system to be reprogrammed i was told it could be done only at the dealer so that is what he recommended he told me the cost would be between and dollars to have this problem corrected now i did nt really have a problem with that because i have not had to have any real repair work done to this truck in almost years however my wife had another idea last year she went to this locale and got a great deal great service and honest information from steve lrb john father rrb at the chandler location so she decided to give john a try since her job is closer to the location in tempe as it turned out it was a wiring issue from the radio i had installed about years ago or so that was causing the issue john and his staff fixed it right up charged my wife bucks for the work but since she had a yelp deal we were only out of bucks so like i said this locale and this company have new customers for life i highly recommend them if you want honest service because believe me that is hard to find today so for all you ac or any car repairs for that matter run do nt walk to az auto air and as always eat drink and be merry my friends
super friendly super lowkey pool tables are pretty much always available and cheap beer what else do you need 
as a native phoenician i have been coming to manuel s for the last years and have never ever had a bad experience here the food is always amazing the service is great the prices are perfect by far my favorite mexican restaurant in the valley would highly recommend to anyone very casual atmosphere
once again a fabulous breakfast green flannel was amazing and my friend got the veggie hash which she said was delicious while there is a wait order a bloody mary lrb or a delirium which my friend said was light and crispy rrb and take in the great patrons we sat at the bar which was fun and had the best service oooh and do nt forget the olive bread with whatever you order  it s so yummy great service and great food
if you have the time to wait for a seat pizzeria bianco is something every pizza lover should experience at least once the pies are that good the seat restaurant in old town phoenix is nationally known and the crowds outside prove it you will need to get there around or in the afternoon to line up for a seat or you may be left waiting until after pm for the second seating really if you get there after pm forget about being in the first group of patrons while you wait bar bianco offers drinks and there are a few places to escape the hot arizona sun most people are nice enough to let you back in line if you need to move so bring a good attitude and make friends with your linemates it will help believe me the pizza is crafted in a woodfired oven which legend has it was delivered from italy brickbybrick and rebuilt on site the meats offered are gourmet and can be a tad salty the other toppings and the cheese are also high in quality the oven creates a wonderfully caramelized crust that the uneducated might call burned however that s their problem the crust is perfect i prefer the sonny boy which has salami and olives or the standard margherita however the handful of other pizzas are equally as good you might want to order two and take what s left home versus finishing and needing to order another pie if you re there during baseball season you can walk to chase field to catch a diamondbacks game and you can park in the garage in between the two locations
first place that has ever moved me to actually go to the trouble to write a review i found it thanks to other great yelpers everything was true great atmosphere awesome music and wonderful bartender thanks for the gummy bear martini chris spot on i tell ya we need more places like this in phoenix
one of the best kobe burgers i have ever had  well worth the for a burger very trendy and awesome service will be back
the pizza is amazing lrb grandma g s and pesto are my faves rrb however if you are one of those that must get something other than pizza at the pizza parlor the pesto penne bake is delicious if you really want a bang for your buck the bollo pasta is endless from to during the week make sure you save room for dessert a delicious pizza cookie partially baked dough with ice cream what could be better  oh yeah better parking
everything on the menu is delicious we used to eat here when it was barrio cafe and still loved it the recent remodel is cute but wish there was more greenery in the outdoor seating to obstruct the views of parking lots and apartments
i live in tempe and the farmhouse is hands down my favorite breakfast place in the valley the staff is always very nice they even often remember my boyfriend and i from previous visits their food is all lrb i think all rrb homemade including their gigantic cinnamon rolls that are out of this world their biscuits that are so fluffy and good and their sausage patties that are done just right the portions are very large so you will never leave here hungry the atmosphere is laid back with a kind of quaintness about it the only bad thing is the wait on the weekends but if you plan ahead and get in line before you re totally starving it s so worth the wait
this is the joint to hit if you re veggy or vegan the faux meat is good and they have a wide selection of faux dishes oh did i mention the vegan crab puffs they are amazing it s worth stopping in for an order of these alone
if there were stars i could leave i would we have a capital grill back home in chicago but have never visited i had the lamb chops and my wife had the filet we both split the gratin potatoes since the side portions are so big lrb recommendation of our server rrb and i ll say the best lamb chop i have ever had cooked perfectly and a very large portion large chops i took our server s recommendation and tried their balsamic to drizzle over he chop and was delicious my wife s filet was also very good of course i had to try it not the best filet i have had but still worth every penny drinks were well prepared and tasty if you have room for desert hands down get the cheesecake i ll let it speak for itself server was great and very helpful with the menu
brief good coffee great people delicious homemade sandwiches and fantastic atmosphere first of all they have free wifi food and good coffee so before going into a deep review those qualities already make for a great experience but to be more specific on the topic requires a little walkthrough you walk into this small unassuming coffee shop nestled between a children s clothing store and scrapbooking shop in the corner of a typical suburban supermarket shopping center and you enter into a world of fantastically quaint decorations miming that of a rural cabin the walls are lined with shelves holding old wooden and metal trinkets a fireplace accents a seating area and a twoman crosscut saw adorns the wall just opposite the register the aroma is that of sweet coffee and home you re greeted with a welcome smile from the barista and immediately you re taken aback by the complexity of the menu the colorful combinations of syrups sauces and drink types tantalizes your imagination you make your order and in no time you have your drink in hand and you savor every last drop of espressoy goodness  snaps fingers  ok now that i ve broken your coffee trance let s review the food and drinks at hand the food is homemade the ingredients are fresh and most importantly the chicken salad is made in house and is fantastic the breakfast croissants are delicious and just about every pastry on display is mouthwateringlyalluring the pastries are delivered fresh from new york west pastry and bake shop more importantly lrb in my coffeeguzzling opinion rrb the coffee beans are freshroasted and delivered twice weekly from riviera coffee out of chandler and the varieties they offer generally include fair trade coffees i must say for anyone used to the gritty bold charcoal taste of starbucks brewed coffees lrb even their so called light roasts rrb the ethiopian peru costa rican or guatemalan brewed coffees here at cabin coffee will absolutely explode with floral notes and caramely sweet chocolate body that you ve never experienced before every coffee has its own unique taste and floral sweetness lrb other than french roast  an overly darkroasted charcoalfest often favored by those who enjoy typically darkroasted seattle style coffees rrb try some brewed coffee get the lighter roast and try for once to drink it without cream or sugar do it you might just find the complexities of actually good coffee more enjoyable than the singlesidedness of halfnhalf and sugar most importantly the espresso this is a shop with a consistently good espresso lrb not mind numbingly amazing but good rrb and a mind for delivering quality espresso based beverages try a double if you re bold try a cafe con panna for a lovely after meal espressoy dessert definitely try an americano or cappuccino and for those of you who are afraid of coffee without sweeteners  cabin coffee has a plethora of torani flavored syrups end result good coffee that any starbucks drinker can upgrade to and feel confident that their drink truly does rock their socks speaking of torani flavored syrups cabin coffee can create just about any concoction you can imagine in their blenders the avalanches here put frappuchinos to shame try the mexican mocha avalanche  cinnamon and chocolate never tasted so good ultimately i love this coffee shop it s not the best coffee in arizona but its really darn good the atmosphere is quaint and homey and it s a great place to study or hang out and get away from the house the staff is nice and helpful and the drinks and food are delicious stop by and if you run into janice the owner make sure you tell her how great a job she s doing keeping this place running so strong
love this place especially because they are open until am
okay so i ve said before that i m a big fan of owner operated businesses and small local businesses this place is one of them you walk in the door and to your left are six refrigerator doors chocked full of about different specialty sodas all priced at a and to your right there are the two owners and two helpers one of the owners is at the cash register and handling the customer service and the other is that the sandwich table whipping up delicious hamburgers subs and the like very friendly and helpful while i was there i asked a couple questions of the owners one was do they weigh the meat before they load it into the sandwich  the guy at the sandwich making table shook his head no and said we want to make it good indicating they just cut a lot in there until it looks right needless to say my sandwich was well portioned rand h and i both got a large ruben on sourdough and split an order of fries i really like this place for a lot of reasons some of which i noted in my review while we were eating i saw a few more orders roll by and they were all generous servings that looked delish
great food their pork is awesome the slow cooking made this dish superb of course the margaritas are as good as they get overall everyones food was tasty and the service was great the place was very busy with allot of energy
one of my favorite hotels in phoenix i worked there for a year and have stayed there a few times as well love the boutique feel the colors the furniture the great atmosphere the art the pool the rooftop i have been to fashion shows here and spent the most awesome new years eve ever here i have gotten guys to get naked and jump in the pool i have done naughty dirty things in the hallways i have met numerous celebrities here i hung out with cheech from cheech and chong at the bar i have been to magazine launches and birthday parties every time i go in there something new and exciting has happened or changed i love this place and i love ben too i hope it is around forever
if you like sushi go here yup the big five stars and they deserve every single star i have tried quite a few sushi places comparing them to my home sushi restaurant and every single time that restaurant had nt compared until we came here we were intending to go to rubio s for a quick dinner after a party and then go hang out at home we have wanted to come here for weeks lrb since they opened this surprise location rrb and they had always been closed and when coming up on rubio s tonight they were still open so we switched to sushi mode walk in and you are visually greeted with a wide open room of maybe tables and booths on the side and of course your sushi bar we asked to be seated at the bar we like to watch the sushi chef make their creations and check out the care of the fish i was originally turned off by how the chef left the doors to the cooler with the fish open it concerned me it s arizona we are hot and i do not want my sushi at room temperature since it s so easy to get sick from meats at that temperature we received the first of our standard first fare with a new sushi restaurant  salmon sashimi and yellowtail sashimi and i actually said out loud wow now mind you i am used to large portions of sashimi and used to fairly large steak slices of fish in my sashimi these were huge steaks of fish we got like steaks of salmon and steaks of yellowtail and they were so thick and barely out of frozen lrb this explains why he left it open he wanted them to thaw rrb i bit into it and the yummy goodness of these fish was just perfect i was greatly happy and looked forward to getting our specialty rolls the first to come out perfect timing after finishing our sashimi was the godzilla roll the roll was very nice looking large pieces and an even number of pieces took a bite holy crap these guys know taste i might have to put these guys up on par with my home sushi restaurant i do nt know about you but the guilt of saying that someone else has the same amount of skill with the sushi knife and taste in comparison to the restaurant you have been so loyal to for years it s rough so i was thinking ok let s try the next roll if they meet expectations then i ll cross that bridge when i get to it dammit now here s the bridge we got the arizona roll very tasty an excellent mix of sweet spicy and bold the sauces were incredible i purely expected a clash to occur considering the three sauces that were on top of this roll but oh my god i m in trouble next roll the baked scallop roll i love scallops they are my favorite raw grilled sauteed or baked these were even better baked on top of a california roll with the unagi sauce very good not too much but very sweet so being the foodie i am i m discussing this quietly with my partner at the bar it s like the staff there psychically understood how we were rating them and they approach us and ask what we think i told them it s excellent and explained why the chef offered us some cold chopped oranges to cool the palate after our intense meal with our beer and sake a perfect topper i feel i ca nt even express how surprised i am that they were so excellent i purely expected these guys to be normal like takamatsu or ahso and was blown away by their incredible taste abilities the people were very nice take out is available we are going back we were watching the chef make other rolls we have already decided what other rolls we are getting if you like sushi go here
this is our new favorite steak house better then flamings and maestros with prices that are awesome i was concerned over the comment on noise level as i was taking my parents who are and years old i called and made reservations telling them of my concern the gave us a booth against the wall and my dad did great do nt waste your money anywhere else if you want steak
the best burger in town i have to come here at least once a week to get my fix the hot dogs their fries and chiken strips are also on the money you just ca nt go wrong
i m definitely a fan the gelato is rich and smooth the staff was really cool about giving out samples and since i was there on a saturday night the people watching was prime  lots of cougars and adam lambert look alikes i got the chocolate caramel and the strawberry combined it was truly sublime i shall return to the gelato spot
this is the st time we ve been to bj s  we ve lived in az always it was a pleasant surprise when we walked in  saw the decorating of the interior  loved the dark woods  the industrial feel of the ceiling  it was warm  inviting  felt like an old world theme the food we ordered was very tasty  no complaints we had rachel as our server  she was very pleasant  professional  helped me with choosing the right kind of beer the hostess was very sweet  seated us quickly i ve read some of the other reviews before we went  was rather taken back by customers indicating the food was ok or the service was not good we had no problem  plan on going back once more to make sure  if we get the service we did this evening  the quality of the food we had this evening we will bring back our friends to enjoy the atmosphere
this place is fantastic and is one of the reasons i love yelp i would have never found this place otherwise even if you spotted me the square mile that it s located in it s the ultimate holeinthewall and the best mexican food i ve ever eaten i have some thrilling news to share there is another rito s lrb opened by the son of the owner rrb it s every bit as good and may be more convenient for you it s at st ave and orangewood  rito s burritos in the little strip mall naturally i tested the green chile burro enchilada style and it was exactly the same right down to the oversized pie plate ahhh do nt worry for those that are concerned rito s is going corporate the new place still has those stylish iron bars between you and the kitchen and although it has bathrooms they are perpetually under repair according to the glossy preprinted sign they ve mounted on the wall and of course it s still cashonly so they have preserved that special charm i know this will make the line longer at the new place but it would be unfair not to share the good news especially when i learned about the original from here enjoy
i went here for my birthday a few months ago and was completely floored by the taste of the food amazing i liked that it was a tapas style restaurant because my dad and his girlfriend do nt lrb usually rrb have big appetites although my husband and i do we loved the atmosphere as soon as we walked in we ordered some delicious sake and we ordered a little bit of everything i thought the vegetarian selection was decent i ca nt remember exactly what we ordered but i remember us all ravenously digging into every plate then greedily waiting for the next the flavors were phenomenal we had to have more we ordered another round of tapas and sake more gluttony followed my dad and his girlfriend ate like pigs but even after about a dozen small plates we were nt filled my only complaint is the huge bill at the end but i do take responsibility for not keeping track of the mounting expense the small plates seem reasonably priced but you need to order enough to get fill your stomach again we loved the atmosphere i loved the erotic art by the bathroom my dad scoffed that s nothing new same shit i saw in the s whatever my dad claims he has already seen everything before at least he was impressed by the food i will definitely be back and give their happy hour a try to relieve some of the burden off my wallet
this place is exactly what it should be a great little watering hole lrb but not a dive in the least rrb it is small dark lrb at night rrb and intimate they make some of the best cocktails i have ever tasted all with fresh juices squeezed on the spot my favorites are the moscow mule the margarita and the cucamint martini my friends all live in this neighborhood and introduced me to it it feels like my neighborhood bar now as well
stopped in here for supper and had a salad that was really good it was the tequila lime salad it was very good my husband had their house tacos which he said was really good as well they are a little pricey but good
love the cinnamon roll french toast every time my out of town family visits this is the place we take them always friendly service and always great food
the staff is very friendly food gets done fast and everything i ve had is amazing the bacon breakfast burrito is so good so is the three rolled taco meal and the bean and cheese burrito i could eat here everyday red sauce is amazing
 stars to offset my unduly low star review from last year rolberto s takes credit cards no more having to hit the atm first holler also now that i ve fully fallen into the dark world of tacos rolberto s has some of the absolute best carnitas and adobada in the area where as most similar places of this type serve an obviously processed previously frozen iteration of carnitas and adobada rolberto s seems far more genuine and homemade also it s very much a family ownedoperated type place and i just love the hell out of it so glad it s so close to my house
excellent service at a fair price they give their customers an honest assessment and provide quality work as necessary these guys are pros they do not create or make up problems with your vehicle like many crooks who call themselves mechanics often do this is the only place i take my car for service you will not be disappointed
great independent bookstore huge selection i like that they have used and sale books mixed in with the new books in each section so you do nt have to look in multiple places lots of seating plus it s connected to wildflower cafe so you can always pop over there for a coffee or lunch nice collection of small gifts journals moleskines etc as well
this is our favorite bar in phoenix we usually come a few times a week the bartenders are all awesome and they mix our drinks awesomely strong also the drinks are totally cheap also the karaoke on friday and saturday usually rules and they finally got darts and a pinball machine back so that s awesome except the pinball machine they have is the simpsons which is super hard to get free games on they should get addams family or twilight zone as far as dive bars go you ca nt really top this place divey cheap strong drinks video crack pool darts pinball jukebox karaoke nice people
when you think of phoenix az you do nt necessarily think gay mecca but there are some really cool gems to discover rainbow cactus up near greenway on cave creek rd is one of those gems it s not pretentious or snooty it s a timeless bar that happens to be gay no disco balls no gogo platforms no naked pixies running around to glamour you with madonna renditions just come on in grab a seat and a drink and chill the hell out you re safe breathe easy pal take a load off and talk to some really interesting characters they have drag shows all the time find the schedule and plan to be there some performances are off the charts brilliant and others are less than spectacular there s also karaoke which is fun even for me and i ca nt sing lrb voice damage rrb it s laid back and there s a lot of talented clientele who come in bring your girlfriends your boyfriends your parents too everybody is as welcome as they make themselves that s why rainbow cactus has been named the gay cheers of phoenix that s why they ll be around long after the trendy bars of the moment have fallen away
i go through phases where i eat nothing but cherryblossom which would be concerning lrb and maybe a little sad rrb if they were nt so good they re also fantastic for casual date nights and several of our friends have gotten hooked after we brought them here absolute musttries baja norte roll  superrefreshing jalapeno with cool dipping sauce extremely spicy gyoza pot  listed as an appetizer but big enough for a meal chashu ramen  anything with bbq pork here is a winner ditto with anything ramen tekkadon  slightly sweet and citrusy tuna bowl my friends always steal mine yakiniku  perfectly tender korean beef on a sizzling plate iron pot udon  seafood and beef are both fantastic spaghetti bolognese  my partner sees me check in at lunch starts craving this and drags me back for dinner dessert  look at that cake and tell me you do nt have room banana bread  the answer to every question about hidden gems in phoenix for a noodle place i m never super impressed with their yakisoba i still order it sometimes and you should try it but it is nt the absolute best thing on the menu the owner and waitstaff are super friendly but service can be slow especially when it comes time for the check if you have a show to catch definitely ask for the check with your meal
being that i live in san francisco and only make it to az once or twice a year i m thankful to get just about any burrito when i m back home that being said sylvia s burritos are some of the best i ve had i quite enjoy the serve yourself chips lrb have as much as you want rrb and the beer selection i had a simple veggie burrito  scrumptious i saved half for the next day s lunch and it was just as good as the night before oh sylvia i wish i could whisk you away to sf
two words chopped salad mmmm i crave it on a daily basis
very classy place with attractive talent  many girlnextdoor types drinks and lap dances reasonably priced highly recommended and would go there again they run a lot of for drink and dance specials top notch
good selection not overwhelming like total wine and more except they close at nine pm most nights lrb
we had a great lunch and it was quick as well we each had one of the lunch specials and we will definitely be back
dlish is just that dlish i can see why they named it that i have become a regular not only for the best green tea in the area but also the men that always great you with a smile and a sparkling attitude whether they are swamped or you are the only person in the place everything i have eaten there is dlish but my personal favorite is the turkey club if you have nt been here it is a must try
this place is great christine helped my wife and i pick out some chocolates as a gift we bought a couple more so we could try them ourselves we ended up eating way too much and had to buy another gift as a substitute to the one we just ate thanks for your knowledge and your great chocolates
this place deserves five stars just for the convenience of being open until midnight when every other lrb toocool trendy rrb places close at or another amazing thing about unlimited is that they have four extremely comfy sofas in the back that i like to get lost in for hours plus outlets everywhere i do nt know how many other cenpho coffee shops i ve been into that are lacking a proper amount of electrical plugs it s really a hassle their coffee and teas are pretty good i like that they have  syrups to choose from to flavor your coffee i usually get an iced with peanut butter and grape syrup they have a good selection of pastries as well and the blueberry muffin is to die for also offered is gelato their mascarpone crunch is so creamy and tasty i just want to take a swim in a pool of it way to go unlimited you are my coffee joint
from ashy to classy
very nice hotel the room was very clean and the staff was nice would defiantly stay here again
best sports bar in valley hands down food is great service is better this is the norm at all locations i was an original downtown majerles regular andnow that i am on the westside its the only place that i will go to watch a game and get a beer
sauce is my absolute fav i do nt think i ve had a single thing there that i have nt liked while they are pretty well known for their pizza which is absolutely delish i usually tend to eat a little on the healthier side and get either the turkey and feta salad or this other salad that has pears in it lrb i kind of forget exactly what it is but i ve gotten it a few times rrb i also like the soup and you ca nt go wrong with their turkey sandwich either oh and their mac n cheese so delish those are pretty good standbys and it s nice that they give you bread and butter on the side no matter what you order even if you do get a sandwich which a lot of places tend to skimp on the bread if you ordered bread as a staple of your meal lrb which is probably better for you anyway but thanks for the extra bread sauce rrb it s also nice that it s really close to a lot of stuff so it s a good lunch spot during the work day do nt get caught browsing at urban outfitters while you wait for your food though or you might get stuck spending bucks in about minutes like i did last time i went yikes
hotdiggitydog this place is hilarious it s horse betting and drinking and eating and gambling and drinking  how could it not be a good time  i do nt even have the slightest clue how to bet on horses but let me tell ya ask the ol guy in the corner and he ll explain a trifecta to you get your drink on and throw your money away because you are heading to turf paradise baby
the fact that this location is open on sundays would be enough to give it stars in my book but it also happens to be the most convenient superaffordable way to get great chiropractic care if you go with the monthly plan adjustments are it does nt get much better than that
walked in for a glass of red during happy hour i noticed a rather interesting pinor noir from the russian river valley picket fence i order up the aroma and a sip suggest a romantic wine gentle with a good dose of berry flavor and a touch of spice i m happy and only dollars it s quiet in the afternoon quiet before the storm i m guessing i walk onto a large patio to sit really this house is very large when this place is busy it must be a lot of fun this is a reasonable and beautiful wine bar to bring a lovely gal and as you might guess this is a great place for a gal on her own to go have a glass
i love this market it s no marukaimitsuwa but i can find what i need here the staff is so friendly knowledgeable and helpful i m willing to pay the price for the goods lrb not all are expensive mind you rrb for the simple fact that the customer service is great the store is clean and the selection is fairly high i love the lady that helped us out she was very sweet and caring i could go on and on about the customer service but i ll spare you all further pain go here you wont be disappointed lrb unless you re flat broke rrb
we leased our volvo here from licia years ago lrb fantastic experience compared with our other car buying endeavors rrb now that my lease is almost up i ve been looking for a car to replace it and also considered buying my existing car when i called licia to ask her opinion she was extraordinarily helpful and actually suggested i not buy or lease a new car from her since buying my car outright made a lot more sense then she transferred me to judd in servicing to explain the warranty i would be getting from the other company so i could make an informed decision if licia judd and powell volvo are the standard the rest of the phoenix dealerships need a wakeup call
i ate there with my wife on a date night the burgers were top notch service was not bad nice atmosphere lots of stuff on the menu but it s an a la carte type menu i love that you can build your own burger adding whatever toppings you want if you go a little crazy it will get expensive not a cheap place of us ate lrb burgers with a few extras rrb sweet potato fries were incredible mainly because of the dipping sauce and sodas total including tip was about i would go back again if i m in the area
if your looking for a great little italian place this is it food is top notch the service is friendly and caring and the prices are reasonable all the pasta dishes we have had have been great as have been the veal dishes we have never been disappointed in any of their wine recommendations as well most of the times we have had to walk in we have been turned away so you should make a reservation first
against the advice of my year old the family ventured out to see killers at farrelli s cinema and supper club in scottsdale farrelli s is a place i frequent on a special night for a movie that i wished i would have caught at the theater the unique twist with farrelli s is the dining and drinking you can do while you are watching the show the movies range throughout the day from great family movies and the heavier stuff at night when the kids should be in bed the wine list and other beverages along with the food are above average quality and price anywhere i can find a glass of row pinot is alright with me my family usually shy s away from the high dollar menu and stick to the salads appi s and the tenderloin sandwich my year old decided the pizza has been too mushy in the past so he opted for the tenderloin sandwich as well this time i had a cold crispy lettuce wedge that was drowned in dressing but oh so good my fault for not getting the dressing on the side i do not understand why  of the restaurants i go to insist on drowning the lettuce my daughter had the chicken ceasar and a blue moon and actually laughed at the silly movie just goes to show how much the environment weighs in on forming an opinion farrelli s is a family run business and seems to be hanging in there in this economy i wish they had a few less expensive options but we always order the same thing there is a nice bar to wait in until seating time and very comfortable rolling chairs to actually view the movie plus great music videos before the show the bartender is always happy and friendly but our waiter kieth seemed a bit put off that we already had drinks when we got to the table and never has as nice table side manor everyone else at farrelli s has always been very nice and happy make sure you get the popcorn it is just like grandma used to make in the popcorn popper only the best ingredients i am getting a group of ladies together next week to go in and catch sex and the city with a donation of a pair of shoes you get a martini farrelli s is a great place for gatherings of all ages and occasions i tell all my friends to go there when they want to do something different farrelli s is a go
last minute dinner plans found me at sauce last night not exactly my first visit but i had not been there in some time the friend and i decided to share the roasted portobello and artichoke bruschetta which we though was quite ok but nothing sensational next we sampled the vegetable salad we both found the mix of fresh vegetables with a little drizzle of dressing very tasty this salad combines carrots asparagus corn tomatoes avocados and a little parmesean cheese it hit all the taste sensations there was crunch some sweet a little bit of creamy and a small amount of sharp from the cheese we polished off every morsel before relishing our pizza now my absolute favorite pizza at sauce is the rosemary potato firstly i for one really enjoy the thin crust on sauces pizza it makes me feel less guilty about eating pizza and there is more flavor to enjoy rather than eating a large amount of dough large perfectly sliced potatoes are nestled between cheese spinach and tapenade on this scrumptious creation and i relished every bite the potatoes are perfectly cooked the spinach provides interest and the occasional bite that lends some tapenade to the combination balances out all the flavors with its salty earthy elements the rosemary infuses this delight with a green freshness and earthiness we were blissfully happy with our dinner it was the first time my friend had tried the rosemary potato and she was surprised at how good potatoes could be on a pizza service is always quick and friendly and sauce is not to hard on the wallet either the atmosphere is very casual and the restaurant is always clean and inviting will be back soon
my kids love this place my husband enjoyed his food as well as the only vegetarian in my family i was surpised by how many options i had on the menu the prices are unbeatable and the little dessert cups are the perfect size i thought the cheesecake one was the best
first time here had the key lime pie with homemade graham cracker crust wow these are great need to go get more i also bought a plantano made with bananas and caramel yummy will go back for more cash or check only very clean store and friendly
i still stand by the potato cakes lrb although they are flat and not thick any more rrb and the feta burger  whole heartedly and it is true the chicken on the southwestern chicken salad is well seasoned and has a good kick lrb appropriately soothedcomplimented by the corn jicama peppers and mixed greens rrb but my most recent trip was on a sunday and we sat at the bar to avoid the wait our service was excellent even though they were really busy tina the bartender was engaging and offered up some great suggestions that s how i found out about the drifter pale ale  a very refreshing beer with hints of grapefruit and apricot and lots of fizz the mimosas during brunch and while i do nt do bloody marys because of the tomato juice lrb yuck rrb i had a taste of tina s secret recipe spicy mixer and it s pretty dang good i could imagine drinking one of those bloody marys plus i noticed they have a sunnyslope high school football helmet lrb along with one from brophy rrb displayed above the bar we all know i m a fan of sunnyslope so for all of these reasons i m adding a star
i love this place every time i work from home or stay home sick i eat here for lunch the carne asada burrito is too good to try anything else the hot sauce is fantastic its so good my year old son eats it straight with his fork
i ca nt remember the name of the special salad we had tonight with shrimp but i will never forget the taste fabulous is an understatement the ny pizza was equally as great every time i come here i say to myself we need to come more often everything is always good diane was our server tonight what a cutie more important is that the service was excellent diane was back at our table many times checking to see if there was anything else she could do for us another comment i want to make is there was a young man taking care of the table at some point i thanked him and was surprised to receive your more than welcome instead of the typical no problem statement coming from young people i should have gone to the management to tell them i was impressed by him his smile and mannerisms we will be back
hubby and i took a friend here last wednesday before heading out to a concert the first thing i noticed was how cool the interior looked  loved the clean lines and modern edge we took a seat at the back bar and ordered drinks of course with our luck happy hour was just winding down and the guys ordered beers i ordered a top shelf margarita that was absolute perfection when it arrived i left the boys in charge of ordering appetizers because as long as its good i ll eat just about anything the chips and salsa came and they were truly delicious chips were hot with just the right amount of salt on them i was glad they put a whole basket in front of just me because i ate every single chip in it we ordered a bunch of appetizers meat skewers and chicken skewers chicken pork and mahi street taco s guacamole and the pork ribs i can tell you that each and every item we tried was just excellent that s tough to do especially with our crowd i loved this place so much i told the manager that they needed to build one out by us in desert ridge i loved this place but tempe is just too far a haul to go have food and margaritas there is no competition here for them  sandbar food is not great the other places here are good but not awesome please open one somewhere near desert ridge until then i will be missing those chips salsa and awesome food
i m not typically in this area but found myself in south tempe after a morning appointment with about people ahead of me in line i knew i had hit rush hour and figured i would be waiting quite a while to my delight i did nt wait in line more than a couple of minutes was helped with a smile and my drinks were out within another minutes wish i lived closer to this location
this is by far one of the best if not the best turkish food we have eaten after living in turkey and going there every year for past years needless to say i have eaten a lot of turkish food the food here athe the turkish kitchen is exceptional the spices are just right and every dish was absolutely delicious i had several mezes soup and the adana and my husband had the iskender the portions were generous and the prices were very reasonable for the quality of food the bread which we learned you can purchase was a special treat as we were only able to get that during ramadan in the past went there yesterday and will be going again tomorrow to try other dishes the staff was very friendly and service was great not only happy to see authentic turkish food in arizona but some of the best tasting turkish food i have ever eaten
i love this place i am a southwesterner to the bone languishing in california and whenever i am back home to visit this is my first food stop the menu is simple and straightforward  mostly fry bread pozole and chili indian tacos sweet fry bread stew plain home food excellently prepared ambience is quiet and unpretentious the service is fast the prices are great parking can be a problem but it s worth walking a couple of blocks faves pozole plain ol fry bread

three words boneinfilet or is that really two  i ll leave it to the more talented wordsmiths to do the math last friday i had one of the better filets of my life cooked to mediumrare perfection you ca nt really get a better steak also watch out their pretzel bread is insanely addictive just say no lrb actually say yes eat a couple then have them take the rest away rrb i m a steak purist and it s worth noting they do add some butter to the steaks after they re cooked if you re like me just ask to opt out service was good but know the ambiance is a little old school the musical act in lounge reminded me of that two person band in the movie swingers cheesy but you do nt really hear it in the main dining room
personally i do nt like sushi but i falling love with sushi after the first visit to sushi ken just that simple
where to begin the beef sandwhich is just awesome and tasty the beef is juicy and the sauce is good the bread is crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside combined with the fresh greens on the sandwhich it s my favorite thing on the menu the chicken pho is right up there with the sandwhich the broth is just delicious as is the noodles and chicken you also have the choice to spice it up with a side plate of other ingredients that accompanys the dish the staff are very friendly and nice
yes five stars everything from the friendly greeting  the door the food the service the cleanliness was impeccable m heard from a friend this was a really good steak place so we decided to give it a try last night we arrived about  hours after opening and the hostess was very friendly and took us to a booth the decor is warm and intimately dark the server came over shortly thereafter and asked if it was our first visit he took time to describe the menu and the restaurant specialties i ordered the top sirloin classic which comes with about a oz top sirloin caesar salad veggie baked potato sauteed mushrooms and house bread m ordered the mushroom sirloin that came with baked potato he ordered a caesar salad on the side we also ordered the garlic shrimp appetizer which came in this cool little dish where each shrimp was cooked in it s own little slot i did have a mojito which was just the right balance of lime sugar and mint the dining manager came to visit us and welcome us on our first visit and gave us a complimentary piece shrimp cocktail the shrimp were huge nice customer service if you ask me our steaks were thick and juicy they were cooked to order and just the right spicessaltiness the baked potato comes with a cheese butter with bacon bits omg yum we did not have room for dessert but they do offer mini desserts lrb seems to be a fad  and a welcome one for those of us who stuff themselves but still want something sweet rrb they also offered a variety of lobster dishes for summer but at a steakhouse i like to stick with steak we got out of there with a bill for a drink appetizer and entrees we will definitely go back and take friends there is a huge outdoor patio area lrb in yesterday s heat it was empty rrb but looks like a great place to hang out when it cools down
attended their easter brunch yesterday great event and fabulous food such a great atomsphere the cafe at the heard museum is a destination i go there just for the food great place
like they even need another review  they have a solid stars as it is just got back from my first visit to adobe and i am beyond impressed my german shepherd pup was having some stomach issues over the holidays so i decided to have him checked out to be on the safe side i knew he did nt have an obstruction or other emergency issue but i was concerned about parasites the receptionist hilary was super sweet on the phone and in person she was upfront with what tests she thought would be ordered and how much it would run me lrb and it was nt an arm and a leg  the office call was only rrb i was very happy they d be able to see me the next morning but then she called back not minutes later with a cancellation and said to come on in even better the tech was very good with nately s pounds of squirming and loved on him the whole time i was also happy they let me help hold him  i ve been to vets that called in a nd tech like the owners are nt capable of safely holding their own dog okay maybe some are nt but i am and i appreciate being able to and not being instructed like a child dr newland was awesome the difference between him and some other vets i ve been to   other vets oh my god we need to run worth of expensive tests and start him on multiple medications general sense of admonishment for not rushing him to their affiliated er clinic eagerness to run the bill up very few questions about anything etc  dr newland super calm and personable he spent minutes going over everything lrb nately s last few days of activity and stomach issues diet contact with other dogs where i take him in public anything he could think of really rrb felt his abdomen thoroughly and said honestly he s a puppy they eat funny things and something probably just irritated his stomach he s plainly feeling pretty good so just feed him a bland diet give him this medication to settle his stomach and bring a stool sample just in case so you know for sure he s parasitefree he also dispensed advice for nately s general care as long as we were there about heartworm prevention and necessary vaccines etc i even got a good education on the different types of parasites and which were even likely in az s climate lrb turns out not many rrb i really appreciated that he did nt try to frighten me into expensive diagnostics and possible serious diseases and that he is so on his game and scientificlogical about things i am very impressed and will be making adobe my regular vet for as long as possible if only they treated birds too
if you re a native this is an entirely different bowling experience this place is awesome the food was great the service was friendly the place looks really cool i m coming back soon
as a resident of the condo complex right behind tammie coemj bread i spend way too much of my money here  how fortunate am i to live right next to my favorite bakery  the bread and sandwiches are fantastic i d especially recommend the natural the monaco and the deviled egg salad all of the pastries and cakes are as beautiful as they are delicious i d recommend the crumb bun the crack cake the chocolate peanut butter bar and any of the cookies the muffins are awesome too but i have to say please bring back the pumpkin chocolate chip muffin it was my alltime favorite item here but apparently it has been replaced by something new the employees are always so nice and so helpful as a regular i have to specifically thank jennifer ryan and jeremy the cook  you guys are great there are often samples of a variety of items and a halfprice happy hour on dry baked goods like bread cookies and muffins lastly if you re in a lunch rush and want something filling delicious and inexpensive lrb and quick rrb grab a couple of sliders from the fridge many of their sandwiches come in slider form which is also a great way to try more than one if you ca nt make up your mind you can grab a small side as well the macaroni or pasta salads are delicious but my favorite is the tuna bean salad i would  recommend everyone try this place  whenever i have family come to visit they always request we return here at least once while they re in town thanks tammie coemj bread
andy is awesome and reasonably priced
i ca nt remember how long it has been since i started going to honey bear s bbq it has to be at least fifteen years i love this place i was there today for lunch and had the shredded chicken and a couple of hotlinks delicious also had some coleslaw too i think i ve had just about everything on the menu and it is all great the service is good and the staff is always friendly if i have one complaint it is that i am sticky and smell of bbq sauce the rest of the day it could be worse any place that s slogan is you do nt need no teeth to eat our meat has my vote the truth of the matter is the slogan is right
amazing dinner the service is great and the food is even better
if you have nt been here yet you should either go right now or punch yourself this place is awesome from the food to the people to even the bathrooms the food  amazing joe who is there quite often and is a very friendly and cultured guy really knows his food even the cheese sandwich is worth the over price tag yeah you read that correctly a cheese sandwich the place  beautiful i would suggest asking joe or his wife for a tour because it really is not apparent as it should be how much time money and effort was put into rebuilding the place oh and definitely check out each of the bathrooms each bathroom is designed by one of the owners individually the coffee  holy crap now i m not a coffee snob by any means but joe has some of the best coffee in arizona and they come in man sized bowls for the coffee addict i d try the mocha bowl with a shot of vanilla the people  cooltastic they really are great people and i think its because they truly love their job bottom line just freaking go and stop making excuses

my favorite boba shop in the valley the green teas have good flavor and boba consistency is topnotch the walls are also crazy lolliwho 
lombardo s gelato is no longer in the fiesta mall they are in arizona mills mall and metro center mall their gelato is absolutely amazing when they say that it is a certain flavor you can guarantee that it will be that flavor it is all natural no preservatives if you have an opportunity to be where they have a location i highly recommend you trying a sample try as many as you like you will not be disappointed my favorite is the pink grapefruit but coconut and pineapple are wonderful as well
this is as good as it gets when it comes to hot and cold sandwhiches chips a toasted sandwhich and your set to run out the door if you re ever downtown check this out only mf though
so this time we ordered in bulk for a backyard wedding rehearsal dinner we had ordered the brisket and pulled pork and cole slaw by the pound unfortunately while we were at the rehearsal the dog tried all of the brisket lrb and amazingly left the rest untouched rrb so i ca nt tell you how it was but the rest was great as always
orgasmic tacos
i am a big fan of gastropubs espcially when they are as elevated as the citizen is we requested to sit next to the open window that faces the street it was a beautiful november evening so a slight breeze was welcomed while we enjoyed our meal our server clark was absolutely charming he gave excellent recommendations when we needed some advice and he was able to joke around with us as we inhaled everything brought to our table our cobb salad our pork belly the cocktails dessert everything we will have to visit the citizen pulic house next time we re in town
love they pizza
when i think royal palms i think romantic getaway a quaint yet exquisite resort the royal palms was built in to emulate a colonial spanish retreat colonial as in when the spaniards were conquering the new world all of the historical details are presented on a frescoed wall in one of the courtyards we had heard some great things about j cook s and decided to spend a leisurely sunday morning dining on the patio if you re looking to be treated like royalty you want to dine here i enjoyed exploring the hotel after a luxe breakfast at j cooks the staff are incredibly accomodating what an ideal location for an intimate staycation it s a nice place to go to grab some drinks and appetizers i will definitely be back to see what more the resort has to offer
the pizza was great i really enjoyed it and next time we will get a bigger pizza thanks for the pizza i really love this place
this is tucked away in the scottsdale fashion square mall by nordstroms it is absolutely delicious at about a cake pop it is slightly pricely but definitely worth its price moist rich cake in the shape of lollipop must trys are red velvet coconut and strawberry if i had known how much i  ld enjoy them i would have bought even more i ca nt wait to go back
since we moved to phoenix from portland three years ago the arizona craft beer scene has blown up a great deal while the state still lags behind its other western states in the local brewery department the distribution and availability of excellent beers seems to expand weekly it s hard to think of a more central hub to that movement than papago brewing a simple pub with a exceptional smattering of craft beers on tap and a bank of refrigerators stacked with the best bottled beer arizona distributors have to offer along with sun devil liquors and topps this is where arizona s beer lovers congregate and the food s not bad either especially the pizza i saw the new expansion for the first time last night and it seems a little incongruous and bright but more seating is more seating and i ca nt complain about that maybe it s the acoustics in the new room but it was loud in there fortunately great beer and the company of beer lovers makes up for it
i ca nt believe i ve lived here for years and have never hiked camelback  well i proudly broke that boundary today it s been something i ve always said i ll do that someday and today was just that day from reading other reviews i took advice and went on the cholla trail sounds like the echo canyon is pretty advanced for me but cholla was a gorgeous hike great views saw a couple iguanas the hike made me proud to live in the desert you ll definitely want to bring some water with and some light sunglasses or a hat obviously do nt forget your sunscreen but i started around am and there was few other hikers so it was pretty quiet definitely was nice to take some breaks in solitude looking out over the valley make sure you have some closedtoed shoes with socks teva s without socks do nt work so well going downhill rrb i think next time i ll bring a small pack so that i can bring a camera or something maybe my blackberry  so i can post some pics right away if you ve been thinking about going do nt wait  go
i was there just last night and today received a rotd for my original review too weird updates  they mix a great margarita no fluorescent green pre mixed margarita mix  they make it themselves with fresh lime juice yum the wine list is small but good my current fave is the argentinian malbec it s only a glass and they pour generously very tasty wine the seating is not comfy if you like to slouch if you sit up straight it s fine but seriously good posture is over rated it gets a little cold in there once in a while during the winter wear long sleeves rrb after glasses of the malbec last night i did nt care this place has really been growing on me nice to have such a great neighborhood watering hole
it had been some time since i ve had a facial and i figured it was time to get one again summers here in the valley can be brutal with temps reaching for days in a row its dry as a bone most of the time and there s always a bit of dust in the air i ve found that since moving here with all the sweating dirt sunblock and stress you really have to take care of yourself or else it catches up with you after searching around most places here charge an enormous amount for a facial on average i ve seen them at about lrb some places more some less depending on a variety of factors rrb somehow i found this place it s close to home has great hours and its affordable after reading the reviews this place consistantly gets between and stars and i thought what the heck i m gonna treat myself so i made an appt and finally rolled in this morning boy was i glad i did this is place is awesome even though its a school and a student does your work it has the feel and is run like a traditional spasalon but at half the price they have different types of facials the dollar one and the dollar one i went for the dollar one for myself it was a full minutes and the girls here are really professional i was greeted immediately by the desk staff and i only had to wait a few minutes for the girl who did my work she explained everything to me that she was doing throughout the facial i got masks some exfoliating was done and my skin looks like a million bucks i got a shoulder and foot massage along with a few other great treatments as well i feel so refreshed and my skin looks great if you have the chance stop by here all the same great bonuses of the salon but at half the price i will be back for more trust me
amazing mexican food and the drinks are knock you on your ass good have the guacamole and a madre then come and talk to me
first and foremost i m not the biggest coffee drinker usually a sucker for coffee beans  sugar  mainly why my drink is a white chocolate mocha however my girlfriend is a bigtime coffee fanatic and a barista she moved to the valley of the sun months ago and immediately tried to find a place that reminded her of home i can admit that i had never been to solo because i rarely ever drank coffee let alone went to a coffee house to sit around while drinking it times change i guess at any rate enough of my rants we went to solo cafe six months ago for the first time and absolutely loved it yes free wifi which is always a good idea if you re running a cafe a easy going atmosphere coffeeesque ambiance with bookshelves tables books and games the latte is awesome and if you re a sucker for sweet drinks like i am i do highly recommend the white chocolate mocha friggin awesome i m a pastry lrb cherry rrb and mocha man now thanks to solo costs me about total for both for the overall quality and professionalism go check it out and chad lrb owner rrb we ll be happy to make you a drink
despite the hype more often than not celebrity chef restaurants tend to disappoint so i was prepared to add michael mina s bourbon steak to the list of bigname letdowns particularly since this is just one of four bourbon steak locations lrb san francisco miami and detroit being the other cities rrb instead i am giving an enthusiastic five stars and including it on my personal favorites list located in the lobby of the fairmont princess the dark lrb i mean really dark rrb and sleek interior looks like it was lifted straight out of the aria las vegas which coincidentally is also home to another michael mina outpost american fish on display as you enter is an extensive and impressive collection of wine much of it from small boutique wineries all of it high quality much of it very difficult to find the dining room is quite elegant with a soaring ceiling softly lit this room is the definition of modern chic for whatever reason a lot of these newer places have dispensed with tablecloths in favor of bare tables which looks cheap to me but overall it is a stunning luxurious room having reviewed the wine list that afternoon and after a nice chat with the sommelier we had selected a couple of bottles for the evening as requested a bottle of altamurra cabernet had been decanted prior to our arrival and was waiting table side this is a stunning wine and proved to be the perfect complement to our experience sadly our second bottle a dal forno romano valpolicella was both expensive and disappointing the house favorite duck fat fries were served as an appetizer while not the best fries i ve ever had lrb for me that distinction still goes to danny s bbq in cary nc rrb they were still quite tasty in addition we also ordered the ahi sashimi as well as a good lrb but not great rrb carpaccio i would skip the carpaccio next time but the ahi was superb dinner for me was the wagyu beef trio which comes with three oz cuts a ny strip filet and flatiron it also includes a side of horseradish whipped potatoes and creamed spinach all three cuts were a perfect medium rare of the three surprisingly the flatiron was my favorite incredibly flavorful and dense i will be dreaming about this steak for quite some time by the time dessert rolled around there was not too much room left but i pressed on and ordered the beignets with macallan butterscotch pudding whoa these was some incredibly amazing totally empty calories they serve three beignets but unless you want to risk a sugar coma you may want to limit yourself to just one service was stellar from start to finish friendly attentive and totally unobtrusive they made the meal a nearly perfect experience so while i am still skeptical with regards to restaurants that have a marquee name over the door in the instance bourbon steak proved worthy of the name michael mina
rosati s has the best pizza on the globe this is the best chicago style deep dish or thin crust i ve ever had please do not listen to the other false reviews about rosati s because they work for other pizza restaurants also this is the only pizza restaurant i have found that has the combination sandwich on the menu i went to the new chicago pizza close by and they did nt even know what a combination sandwich was if you want the best pizza proceed to a rosati s location asap
so i had been here before for all of about minutes and was nt able to sample any food or beverage on thursday last week i was able to get the full experience i was taken here on a date that s right someone took me here that was a nice change of pace we got there around on a thursday night and the place was nt too busy we sat inside right next to the roll up doors the place used to be a firehouse so there was perfect weather we started the meal with drinks she ordered a bottle of sauv white i finally got to try an argentinian malbec full bodied lrb well that is what the waiter told me rrb the malbec was very good i tried some of the sauv it was very tasty also i usually do nt like whites but it was nt too dry we shared a small bowl of marinated olives kalamata and green olives very good i ate most of it for the main course i had the salami  manchego panini with pesto omg this thing was awesome very toasty and buttery i had half of it with a salad the salad was simple greens with flaky tuna now this could have been canned tuna and anyone who knows me knows i hate this with every ounce of my being with that being said the salad was excellent the tuna was marinated in vinegar and capers and took away a lot of the nastiness it had a simple balsamic vinaigrette on it i was very impressed with the food and ate every bit on my plate for dessert we split a flourless chocolate souffle it had a very large ripe strawberry on top and a huge dollop of fresh whip cream if you like chocolate get this and you wo nt be disappointed we finished up the food and headed to the patio the patio is cozy with several fire pits and lots of seating this would be a great patio for a day drink or to unwind at night i have always wanted to try mate pronounced mawtay lrb thanks z rrb a traditional south american tea it was very good but on first taste reminded me of a cigar ask them for honey and put it in very good they bring out a thermos type thing of hot water so you can just keep refilling i highly recommend it this is a little gem in the heart of sunnyslope great patio very warm interior great service and great food the food menu is small but i bet everything is done to perfection large interesting wine list for the wine aficionados out there i love when little local places blow me away
open free place to create and collaborate try a wednesday night hacknight or wednesday brownbag lunch session for your first time just walk in find an open desk get on the free wifi and chat with those around you
if by some strange happenstance i were to try veggie tacos that were somehow better than gallo blanco s my head might explode i could write love poems to gallo blanco s veggie tacos so sooo good and cheap i wo nt rhapsodize about the guac and elote but they are also delicious and the drink menu is good enough that this place could stand alone as a bar the best part about this place though is the variety of ways to enjoy it you can get tacos and drinks while lounging in the supercomfy pool area or stake out a spot near the bar on flamenco wednesdays or grab a spot on the patio on cool fall evenings or you could go the traditional route and get a table in the restaurant s lovely and modern and chic interior i ca nt say enough good things about this place stars
great as always
i used to frequent the salad bar that used to be in this spot before they closed so i had a chip on my shoulder the first time i walked in lucky for them i absolutely love greek food and now lucky for me that this place exists the food is amazing i absolutely love the gyros great salads and very good dolmades if mediterranean food is what does it for you give this place a try
i love this store the produce is always fresh they have an interesting selection of frozen items including some great appetizers the meat department is outstanding  i ve tried a few different kabobs from here lrb spicy kabob rocks rrb bakery is great nice selection of hard to find dairy items like fig yogurt fair cheese selection including a local fresh burrata and mozzarella that will knock your socks off excellent selection of wines and craft beer and a floral department that has exquisite arrangements aside from the above they make great sandwiches have a nice salad bar have different take out dinners available every night have a pasta night and will make you a fantastic iced tea or an iced latte that rivals any chain they also have an awesome grill  they will make you a kobe blue cheese burger that is out of this world the hot dogs are delicious but they are gigantic lrb and a little unsettling to look at rrb one piece of advice before you go not everything turns over quickly so check the dates
thanks to yelp and the reviews i had a very nice haircut and a friendly conversation traveling through an unfamiliar area and trying to find a good barber would ve been a bear all the other reviews were absolutely accurate so i wo nt repeat but the top was i got the haircut and hot towel at the senior rate of i am so happy that i signed up with yelp just to write this review
i love this place i just recently moved to san francisco from arizona but i already made sure to visit it on my first trip back i have never brought someone there and had them not like it the atmosphere is great  small and cozy and very warmly decorated for a former post office the wine list is comprehensive for both the white and red wine enthusiasts and the servers are willing to make recommendations off of the list from their cellar service is typically good unless they are super busy lrb friday and saturday rrb in addition to the wine choices the bruschetta is awesome my favorite is the red pepper goat cheese but i ve also heard very good things about the proscuittomascarponefig one you order a sampler of four different types at a time  and there is a pretty even mix of vegetarian and meat options the only problem is that location is less than desirable for people in the se valley  it is a far drive from chandler or gilbert to the arcadia neighborhood in phoenix here s a tip though when you get there do nt wait for someone to leave or pay for the valet parking in the crowded lot there is plenty of parking available for free in the side streets nearby
back in july a few of us girls at work found a living social coupon for this place for for classes being that we all could use a little more exercise in our lives i bought the coupon and started going to classes the yoga studio is tucked away in a shopping center off central and camelback behind aj s fine foods and next to a hair salon the basis of hot yoga is to do yoga positions in a room held at degrees with  humidity for minutes this allows you to flush all the toxins from your body speeds up your metabolism reduces stress levels and basically cleanses your whole body while you get a good healthy workout intense  yes but not impossible you will sweat everything out literally i admit like others here you feel like quitting minutes in because you think your going to die from the heat and your sweaty as hell but keep going it gets easierbetter i can not begin to tell you how awesome i felt after my first class just amazing for starters even if your a beginner like me do not be intimidated the class is welcoming to students of all levels i ve only been to one other yoga class before in my life and that was years ago here are a few pointers to help you out and tell you more about the studio itself a rrb drink an enourmous amount of water before during and after class especially the day before class the day before drink drink drink you will sweat like no other during class and you need to stay hydrated drink a lot of water after class as your body is going to be dehydrated and you will be flushing toxins out of your body also when you bring water to class make sure its frozen before hand if you do nt it ll be warm in minutes and useless the studio does sell water bottles but its like a bottle you can go to circle k and get one for a dollar throw it in your freezer and take it to class with you b rrb bring a big towel to put over your mat your going to need it to collect the sweat and to wipe your face and body periodically during class it also allows you not to slip on your mat when you do the standing poses for the first half of class the studio does rent towels but it costs a few bucks i bring a beach towel with me and it gets soaked by the end of class from sweating the studio itself is spacious but fills up quickly you want to make sure you get a spot where you can see yourself in the mirror while you work out it allows you to perfect your poses as the instructor talks you through the class helps you become more limber and stay focused i personally like to sit off to the right side because during class while the instructor is walking through the studio they will open the doors and you can get a blast of cool air this my friends is the most refreshing thing ever sit off to the side near the door you will thank me later the instructors themselves are really positive and encouraging my first class ever was with this girl melissa and she made me feel right at home explaining everything each pose has a benefit for your body and she lrb along with the other instructors rrb will tell you what its for for example there s one where you lay on your back and pull your legs to your chest  that s great for digestion another for reducing anxiety others for expanding your lungs and so on they also tell you to work at your own pace do nt kill yourself there s skill levels of all kinds here and you ll notice it in class i would go to classes with my friend nicolle from work and we had a blast each instructor brings their own personality to class but you follow the same routine every single time some will work you harder then others but again go at your own pace if you feel like you need a break lay down on your mat or do the downward dog position like i do and pick up at the next position after you regain your composure the only downside to the studio is the studio itself smells funky i wish they would spray some febreeze in here or something because i think it smells aside from that i really enjoyed my time here and would love to go back in a heartbeat staff was awesome positive and encouraging plenty of class times available and a great way to get back in shape
i am always in search of a good burger while my search will always continue this place will go in my top we must have gotten there just at the right time because there was nt much of a line i did however see the cash only sign right away which might be annoying to some this is my kinda place thougha hole in the wall with delicious simple food i ordered the bacon cheeseburger and i loooove how they made the circular bacon to fill the whole burger i can see how the condiment station might be a turnoff for some but considering i like my burger pretty plain it did nt really bother me we rode the light rail so we did nt have issues with parking but i can see how the parking might be problematic around lunch time i dig the tree stumps as chairs but that s just me we got burgersfries and drinks for bucks and it was worth every penny every few months i think about becoming a vegetarian it s places like this that make me realize what a ludicrous idea that would be
amazing gas station they have a bistro and full service car wash this bistro is the real deal i recommend the beef brisket
i found this resort to be just wonderful our room was very large but unfortunately there was only one chair besides the desk chair on which to sit that was the only negative aside from the extremely rude loud guests that walked the halls not the resort s fault that some guests have no manners the grounds were lovely the fountain out in front often had birds drinking and the trees lit up at night were beautiful everything was convenient ie shops highways restaurants the pool and hot tub were refreshing sangrias has a great happy hour our room looked out onto the golf course people that have complained about the size of the bathrooms have obviously never been to new york the outer dressing area with sink worked very well so that two people could get ready simultaneously the wedding we attended was held in an area that we had not previously explored loved the fountains i would definitely return if in the area
i m not sure why it has taken me so long to actually go inside gokatgo but i finally did and loved it this store is filled with all sorts of great retro hawaiian treasures along with a plethora of other gems we ve got locally designed clothing in one corner awesome furniture in another tons of handmade accessories in the middle and bunches of fun throughout it was really hard not to pick up everything in this store and buy it the owner was really nice and offered to hold our stuff while we shopped i ended up walking out of there with an awesome dia de los muertos pillow that looks amazing on my new couch plus a matching potholderoven mitt set in a really cool pattern i will definitely be back especially since my other mom s bday is coming up and she loves this kind of stuff
eba cafe and wikiwiki sitting in a tree k i s s i n g first comes grilled pork next comes boba with a boba straw and they lived happily ever after  here s hoping because eba has the best boba in all of phoenix and let s face it boba cures all try the taro it s amazing
i bought groupons for unicorn balloon company to help my mother fulfill one of the items on her bucket list i was a bit worried as i had read a lessthanstellar review but ultimately i was impressed by the professionalism of this company we had no problems using the groupons and making the reservations a few months in advance we met the van at the designated time and they took us to the launch site checking the air currents for the best launch site they allowed nonriders to follow to the site as well our pilot capt john bagwell was very knowledgeable and personable telling humorous stories interspersed with ballooning facts he also took video of the flight which will be available via email at no extra cost  something most ballooning companies do not do our flight lasted about  hrs and apparently our chase truck had a flat tire so was a bit late getting to the landing site lrb though others in view did not rrb we did tip on landing but at the current windspeed that was to be expected and the pilot warned us that it would happen lrb note re previous reviewer the chase crew does not help you land rrb we had a champagne toast and continental breakfast as they presented certificates a very nice morning indeed
the food and drinks are always excellent and the service is consistently good the happy hour is a great value  you can mow on a ton of food and drinks for very little money
amazing i have been to this place quite a few times i do have to say i favor the classics over some of the more experimental ones but do nt take that as an insult to the experimental ones  this girl just likes some meat and potatoes the only pasty i did nt like that i ve had was the royale with cheese the cheese was very stinky and very potent maybe you like stinky and potent cheese though and maybe it s for you phenomenal place
went back to true foods lrb i have been doing this a lot since my first trip rrb with my mom for dinner last week it was amazing as always however this time was different i tried a new menu item the bison burger lrb i highly reccomend this rrb it was so tastey and very light for a burger omg i want to say that this time was different because we had the best service ever our server marcus was amazing he was very informative helpful polite and everything you would expect from a server and then some love this cat just thought i would give credit where it is due too many times you read about the negatives on service and not so often the positives i work in a restaurant and know it s important for employers to know who their stars are marcus is your star a bright and shiney star lol loves shitaki mushroom lettuce cups ahi sliders spaghetti squash kale salad raviolli green tea coffe lrb black rrb and i always have to have the banana chocolate tart definitely
i had a lunch here today it was worth to burn the gas from avondale i ordered  lrb stir fry rice noodle with meats and veges rrb omg it was soooo good but the portion was smaller than i expected i think i can eat here every week i like to try rice noodle soup lrb pho rrb next time
love that they have full hot breakfasts not just reheated breakfast sandwiches best part is the thick buttered fresh toast i placed my order at the register and a few minutes later my eggspotatoestoast was delivered to my table hot and delicious large portion as well so good value the staff walks around cleaning and asking if everything is ok the rest of their menu looked great  i got to try the chopped salad that was wonderful with very fresh ingredients wish i had a chance to try more before i left arizona this location was spacious and has outdoor seating sooooo much better than panera bread
what a wonderful yoga studio this is the only one i ve been to but i ve been so happy here so there s no reason to go anywhere else the instructors are wonderful and each one brings something different to the studio everyone i ve met here has been kind and inviting as a yoga newbie this place has become completely addictive
i was really looking forward to eating here this morning when i got to the restaurant and found that everything was super clean and nice looking i had been drinking all night and it was time for some breakfast they had a great selection of hot tea the people in my party got quite a few things and everything came in heaping portions the french toast is the super thick kind and very fluffy they also proved that they can really cook eggs well they also brought lots of coffee and hot water for all of us i also go their chicken tortilla soup and it was amazing the service was super fantastic i will definitely come here again rrb
yummy yummy yummy yummy needless to say i love sweet republic needless to say so do many others judging by the number of positive reviews that came before mine and i could nt agree more nestled in a small strip mall at a corner about less than a mile east of shea blvd you first enter sweet republic with their numerous accolades and recognition displayed to your left as well as on a small monitor on your right  so you know many others have discovered and loved sweet republic as well the interior is not huge i m guessing they have a capacity to seat about to people but who cares you come there for the goodies my faves are the chocolate sorbet and the coconut sorbet the chocolate sorbet tastes deeply rich i have nt tried all the flavors but why even stop at the ice cream they have plenty of other treats to try please do try the marshmallows and the almond toffee brittle they have got to be among the best things i have ever eaten they taste sweet and flavorful and taste fresh the marshmallows are like no other these are what marshmallows are supposed to taste like the almond toffee brittle is easy to bite through and break if you crave something sweet sweet republic is absolutely a mustvisit i might mention i ve seen supplies of their pintsized desserts stocked at whole foods in scottsdale as well
mention any sort of kung pao and this vegetarian begins to shake and quiver i tried the green version with the crispy tofu and found it delectable spicy yet not overpowering and the tofu lived up to its description the wife got a jerk salad that was also very tasty the servings are quite good for the price and the atmosphere is excellent good for people watching green reminds me more of a restaurant from seattle or portland which is a nice touch in this neverending drive of tgi mcfunsters
oh my geezy these donuts are soooo good  always fresh no matter what time you get them chocolate bars  buttermilk are my favorites coconut smoothie is amazing there too
the star rating is a combo good food  cool place  wish tempe could support more unique restaurants like this one had both the oxtail lrb excellent rrb and the jerk chicken lrb really good rrb  the plantains are a special treat lrb could hear them sizzling in the kitchen rrb i m into heat  but do nt expect lrb or be concerned by rrb a lot out of their jerk sauce  it s a guyana jerk style which is considerably milder than jamaican version
outstanding service i ll never park at the airport again i entered the lot parked was in the van at my terminal  phx within minutes no exaggeration secure and covered parking lot that spots you a cold bottle of water on the way in and out check the website or paper for coupons
a friend and i had a delightful experience here we ordered an avocado roll and pad thai the avocado roll was simply to die for it was soft and creamy  and i m including the rice in this too it was an avocado roll all other avocado rolls should bow down to it slid down the throat so deliciously gracefully an addiction was created in one bite and the pad thai we ordered with chicken instead of shrimp another wow moment sweet and savory melting in the mouth just the right bit of everything and an abundant portion of it will definitely return for more

i ve been a member of this gym for a few weeks now and i have no complaints it is ideal in every way upon entering you re greeted by several friendly faces in red shirts they actually seem happy to help with any questions people have which is nice that s a common thread among all of the employees here the trainers are fun intelligent and motivating and they always seem happy to answer questions about form rather than just implying you re a leech for not buying a whole session just so you can learn how to do one move the locker rooms are fantastic  they have towel service ample amounts of lockers showers and sinks and everything is super clean they have multiple blow dryers qtip dispensers body lotion and mouthwash there s a steam room and a sauna they also have plastic bag dispensers so that you can avoid your gym bag getting super smelly the cardio area has lots of machines  i ve never had trouble getting whatever i wanted to use all the machines also have their own tvs they have a good selection of channels plus they show movies every day the yoga studio is really nice lots of classes to choose from every day and good instructors i have nt actually gone to any group fitness classes but everyone always seems to be having fun in them the trx  crossfitstyle area is my favorite part of the gym lots of kettlebells bosu balls medicine balls body bars stability balls and other fun toys the trainers teach a few classes in this area but you can mostly just have free reign there s also a smoothie bar a massage therapist a boxing ring  instructor a chiropractor tanning beds and childcare none of which i ve ever used but it s nice that it s there this is a great gym it s pricier than my old gym but  worth it also  with regards to the other review they have dispensers of antibacterial wipes for wiping off machines after use and people are actually pretty good about using them
it s the best downstairs hanging at the bar you ca nt beat it the food is excellent
i almost wish i had nt discovered this place because it s so good ton s of flavors and every kind of topping you could want lrb even cake frosting rrb so much better than mojo and to top it off the staff could nt have been nicer

eating here is more like an experience than just a meal i had the salmon yvette tonight it was perfectly cooked in a luxurious citrus sauce with crawfish and shrimp this is definitely the best seafood dish i ve had in phoenix to date go to pappadeaux you wo nt be disappointed
its rare for me to want to give a pho restaurant five stars usually they either lack in service or cleanliness or tastes like msg but no this restaurant really lives up to it s name the mom and i came here before grocery shopping inside mekong the staff were really friendly and speedy in taking orders it did take a while for our pho s to come out but they say it s because they make everything in order of ticket made to order pho  i ca nt complain meanwhile it being our first time there we decided to indulge in their spring rolls there was nothing but shrimp lettuce and noodle in the roll but surprisingly flavorful we get the pho the soup tastes clean and fresh there seemed to be lots of cilantro in it which i loveeeed and my mom loved how it didnt taste like they poured in msg large portion of noodles lots of meat and clean bean sprouts perfect for a hungry stomach definitely unphogettable  p
the only bad part is that to reach them i would have to go all the way up nooooooorth anyway it was good for the first and last time rrb

this restaurant knows exactly how to make your tastebuds dance the food was top notch and the service impeccible the duck and foie gras to die for our server was so great and offered the perfect suggestions we had polished off our bottle of wine before dessert and i hesitantly declined an after dinner drink the waiter must of sensed this because upon my return from the ladies room to our table my husband informed me that our server brought me a complimenary drink the ambience was romantic and i hope to return soon
i was wary of trusting yelp after the debacle of culinary excrement served to me at wineburger but rocket burger delivered the beefy goods great soda selection friendly service and the burger wow i had the baja burger and it packed an explosion of flavor i made the mistake of getting a rocket burger which was too large for even me after a while i ditched the bun and went to town on the meaty goods this is a place that knows how to season meat rocket burger i shall return
it takes an astounding restaurant to motivate me to login online to leave a review this one definitely deserved it i ve tried several pho restaurants in the phoenixtempescottsdale area and this is the best one i ve tried the food is amazing the staff is friendly the location is always clean the menu is not overpriced the selection is great and the food always comes out very fast i always leave this restaurant impressed if your looking for a great pho experience this the best pick in town no competition
only place to get your eye glasses you do have to get your exam somewhere else and bring your prescription i do nt know why anyone would go anywhere else
so it was time for me to stock up on bras i wanted to go get properly fitted as i think every girl should at some point in thier lives this place was great it s located right in scottsdale in the same shopping complex as saba s western wear its a small little boutique cute quiant and comfy it really felt like someones home pink walls lots of bras and other odds and ends for women of all sizes this place caters to all women of every shape size and color they carry a full line of support for women who are full busted or not along with post op breast surgery stuff as well they carry a full line of product they will even special order stuff for you on saturdays they are only open between  and closed on sundays they advertise as being by appointment only but you can walk in and shop just like i did i was greeted by a young lady who was professional in every way i asked her a lot of questions and she was able to answer every single one for me i told her i just needed a few every day bras nothing fancy or exciting she had me step into a fitting room and measured me for size she brought in a variety of bras and i tried on each one to see what i liked best to my delight most of the bras in the store were all reasonable in cost to what i would spend elsewhere between  dollars i should also mention that the measuring was obviously at no charge i was so thrilled to actually have someone who knew what they were doing during the entire session no pushy saleswomen no bad information no trying to upsell me on a bra i didnt want or need i also found out that they have a location in tucson and that has been around for about years and thier scottsdale location has been around for about years quite impressive this place was totally what i needed real service by women who knew what they were doing no pressure to by and i actually learned a lot while i was there about bras and such some of it i already knew but some was new to me as well give this place a try i think you ll be impressed and be as happy as i was with the experience
truly a slice of heaven i was hungry had nt had lunch and quickly popped into mamma mia s for a slice it s unfathomable that something so delicious could be so inexpensive an enormous slice of ny style pizza for plus a quarter per topping i was in a mushroom mood and it was just fabulous the sauce and crust are so good  and it s got just the right amount of cheese  enough that gives you the cheese stretchies that you want but without impeding the flavors of the toppings and sauce i have nt tried their sandwiches or pasta yet  but i plan on it the people working there are also super friendly the only thing that is a bummer is that it s pretty small so do nt plan on bringing a big group otherwise i just ca nt say enough good things about their pizza
this place is so freaking good i ve only ever ordered one item and that s the veggie sub maybe sometime i ll try the cheese one but if it ai nt broke the mayo is the best i ve ever had i love their ice great ice the patio is misted the decor is fun totally worth the drive if you re in a mile range
great place great salads and sandwiches i recommend the baby bleu salad or the rbc sandwich great local and not local a beer on tap an in bottles great all day happy hour on sundays and mondays drafts all day
it s official i m in love with fez i ve never had a bad experience here i ve been to fez with small groups and larger ones and never had bad service most recently i was there with for brunch with smunch lrb httpsmunchphoenixcom or httptwittercomsmunchphoenix rrb which wound up being a group of over people for saturday brunch thomas and his staff never missed a beat especially our server who gracefully handled a constant stream of orders and meal deliveries as people arrived at different times the food at fez is divine the sweet potato fries are ridiculously good as is the fez benedict and peach bellini for brunch the benedict is a wonderful twist on the classic served on french bread with ovendried tomatoes on top of the great food and service i love the ambiance and location of fez as dave b said the interior is totally metrosexual in a good way it has all of the upscale urban vibe that phoenix needs more of and the location on central avenue is perfect parking is not a problem and it s only a couple minutes walk from two light rail stations if you want to leave the car elsewhere the bottom line is that fez is great place whose attention to quality and urban ambiance makes it one of the best dining destinations along the central corridor
tucked away but close to tempe marketplace is this delicious chicagan pizza place the staff was friendly and worked well as a team they made a split pie for me  hawaiian and  supreme i will return

in a metropolitan city like phoenix it is definitely nice to have an outdoor retreat just minutes away the park is easily accessible free parking in its huge lot the first thing i said after getting out of the car was it finally feels like arizona mountains trees cacti ponds omg dirt after strolling around the entrance of the phoenix zoo we made our way over to the popular geological formation called holeintherock giant holes caused by erosion millions of years ago a short trail around to the back and a small climb to the largest hole great landscape view from the top the other holes are also accessible but for more experienced hikers there are other trails throughout the park and other attractions such as the desert botantical garden and hunt s tomb papago park highlight of my trip  d
this place is really great lrb but you ll have to get over the intense nail salon smell inside rrb the owner is very nice and easy to talk to the frozen yogurt is really really good i asked for a small cheesecake flavor easy on the berries and instead i got tons of berries layered up but that was due to generosity which was very sweet i m definitely an addicted fan
i just did monday night burgers at maizies again and i do have to admit that when you are starving for their nummy burgers you get a little impatient waiting outside but it is worth the wait wait times on mondays vary depending what time you get there and remember if you are waiting for your friends that they will not sit you until all of your party is there lrb which is understandable since they are in high demand rrb the wait staff is always friendly despite how busy they are and as crazy as it sounds we have sat outside all  times we have gone on monday nights and it was nt too bad with the misters in the shade all i can say that sitting outside we got to sit and eat faster than anyone else and our food came out surprisingly quick as well there really is nt a burger as good as maizies they serve their burgers on ciabatta bread with all the fixings but if you want cheese it is more so if you are ever jonesing for a burger on monday nights then hit up maizies for sure it will satisfy your craving as well as be good for your budget
i absolutely love this place they are always friendly and nice they do a great job on my car every time i love to sit in the lobby and look at all the fun merchandise sometimes i wish my car took longer i would never go anywhere else i m a danny s customer for life

just stopped in biagio nail and spa for a nice manipedi after work i had received a coupon in the mail for a pedicure and since i am in a wedding this weekend i decided it was time to try this place out i have been to about other nail salons within a few blocks of this place and i tell ya the decor cleanliness and people here are like none other it was tastefully decorated and spacious as well as very clean the pedicure chairs are located in the back which i thought was really nice also their pedicure chairs were the best included in the spa pedicure which i got for exactly was a really nice grain like scrub lrb not to be confused with a salt scrub she had asked me if i wanted salt scrub and i kindly declined rrb i also decided to get the shellac manicure that i keep hearing about which turned out amazing even better the shellac manicure is only additional to all of their manicures so for i got a fabulous pedicure and shellac manicure amy my nail tech also gave me a quick but great back massage which i believe is included in their manicures becuase as i looked around the other customers also were receiving these great back rubs ca nt wait to go back

i have always been surpriseddismayed as to how difficult it is to find good greek food in phoenix well here you go i will admit that i am a bit of a gyro junkie and have not tried anything else on the menu but this is my goto place for greek food i have been known to drive minutes out of my way just to pick up a gyro from this place great food  friendly staff  clean  what more can you ask for 
i am addicted to the bean burro to the tune of once a week this is also in my neighborhood so i want to support them as much as i can this food is not fastfood mexican nor is it typical greasy sonoran the menu is small but tasty in addition to the bean burro i highly recommend the ceviche lrb weekends rrb the carne asada and the salsas for a more genuine experience order a margarita mexican coke or one of the fruit drinks made fresh on the premises sit outside enjoy the weather bob your head to the music and all will be well i promise
i can not understand why i have nt visited this restaurant more it s really good two of us went and both had the double r chopped salad and both agreed it was delicious the greens were fresh as were the veggies and meat my hubby had the butternut squash soup and it was fab this is a great place for lunch but if you re with a group of friends that want to talk be forewarned it s loud in here still great food and reasonable prices we ll definitely be back for more
i came here saturday at noon with my girl brooke i ve been here once before but over years ago it s a smaller nail salon with about or pedi spa chairs  about or nail stations i usually bring my own polish but this time i did nt because i wanted green  did nt have that color selection was decent but a lot of the bottles looked old still found the color i was looking for though my pedi was awesome  a good deal at lrb plus for colored tips  for flowers so total rrb brooke got a full set of acrylics with pretty pink glitter tips for i believe  wish i took a pic of her nails fyi  if you re paying with a card you have to tip in cash i d definitely come here again
food is outstanding however the last time i was here the girl behind the counter thought it was necessary to be playing heavy metal music at the volume level of very unprofessional of her but the food is
very accommodating and friendly great food
we decided to sit on the patio by the heater and enjoy our beautiful arizona weather i am not a beer drinker but after all the reviews i figured i should give a beer a try i told the waiter what i was after lrb not yeasty or bitter not too strong and a little sweet rrb he was so patient and brought out a couple of samples i loved the hefeweizen and ordered a pint of that my boyfriend got their home made root beer which was amazing lrb brought back memories of childhood rrb the waiter was knowledgeable and answered all our questions about the menu we decided on pizza and a salad the house salad was phenomenal such fresh ingredients with a light dressing and the most wonderful mixture of crunchy and slightly spicy nuts i could make a meal out of it and next time i might for our pizza we got half pepperoni and half fennel sausage both were excellent we each liked our own half a bit better so it worked out great you have to save room for these little cake pops they are lollipops that are like a cakecookie batter with a hard coating on the outside they come in many flavors  snickerdoodle mocha peppermint red velvet gingerbread chocolate coconut we got snickerdoodle and mocha and they were both excellent the perfect amount for dessert when you are full but still want something sweet they have only been open a week and are still working out a few bumps lrb the server disappeared a couple of times when we were looking for him rrb but overall this was a fabulous experience how wonderful to have an independently owned little place like this right in our back yard we will definitely be back
up to now my year old loves going to the dentist bc all she had were cleanings when i found out she had cavities i can imagine myself dragging her to the dentist till she s thanks to fellow yelpers kid s dental place has become my new favorite i ve actually went to the mesa location st but it was a disaster lrb totally different than the indian school location rrb but it was dr nielsen s expertise that convince me to drive all to the other side of town the waiting room was welcoming  consisted of a plasma few toys  a separated reading room the dental rooms were good size consisted of new equipments  a ceiling plasma where my daughter got to watch spongebob it was really dr nielsen that deserves the stars he was gentle caring  precise my daughter got her fillings without nitrogen gas or injection bc dr nielsen knew my daughter would stay put once the filling were in he took his time to make sure the filling felt  comfortable to her the icing on the cake was they give  cash discount perfect for people like me that fall in  out of dental plans the good  dr nielson is awesome  office assistants were nice too  sat appt  digital xray  emergencies  walk ins welcome  fees reasonable   cash discount  instead of getting a toy for the goodie bag we got a balloon  a good job certificate for peter piper personal pizza  a drink the bad  need to redo their flyers to indicate that certain location lrb mesa rrb do nt have digital xray sat appt etc
so i m and still had fun at this place i went with my sister and my year old niece it was a blast i think kids of all ages will be entertained here there is a special room for toddlers lrb age and under rrb super fun for the little guys plus they wo nt be pushed aside by the bigger kids there are lots of different rooms featuring different activities fun for everyone if you come here thinking of this as a true museum you might be disappointed it is more of a place to let the kids run free and expect the kids to sleep in the car on the way home as it will wear them out the place has super cool decorations all over everywhere there is something to look at bring hand sanitizer if you are grossed out easily afterall there are kids everywhere wiping their nose and eyes and who know what else there was a small snack room sandwiches were we got little tubs of pasta salad and potato salad those were each

ok this place is the best place to get sausages in phoenix period the breakfast sausage could very well best the best ever i go here regularly and have had so many of thier sausages they have all been great i do not even buy supermarket sausage anymore after finding this place not even in the same ball park top notch
this is the best buffet in az huge variety from veggie dishes fish shrimp mussels and even sushi the quality of food is very good too one thing i have learned is when looking for good asian food look inside this place is always full of beautiful asian folks so you know its good just sayin for a buffett they have a really nice staff there is a shrimp dish with a sweet cream sauce that is amazing it is more pricey than most asian buffets but well worth the extra few bucks i eat here at least once every couple weeks
hubby and i hit aiello s for the first time on his birthday which also happened to be the restaurant s year anniversary can i just say how nice it is to have a great restaurant that s open on monday monday is chefowner joe s night off but you would nt have known it we had the calamari app split the ravioli special as a first and had a chicken and veal dish for entrees we took home some cannolli and a ton of food that we could nt finish i m really a fan of this restaurant it s not stuffy or staged feeling they manage to hit on all cylinders without feeling forced or pretentious in fact the food is just a bit rustic yet still perfect which means that chef has got his kitchen well trained in his absence coowner myrah is a strong presence on the floor greeting each customer topping off wine glasses making sure everyone is happy my only real bitch  the butter is too cold seriously that s the best i can do for a complaint if aiello s feels like that great neighborhood italian place you miss from new york that s because that s pretty much what it is the menu is ample and diverse made with quality ingredients and exceptional care and attention and this is just about the best selection of italian wines in the valley seriously let me reiterate the value we ate like fiends lrb courses rrb had cocktails two highend bottles of wine and took home desserts and it was just over for something i consider star  dear god i wish i lived next door to this place
visited again today loved the new musical instrument section and the expanded sheet music area awesome

la baguette was trs bon pardon my franglish i have more reason to frequent here now to improve my francais i was glad to know that my bonjour was elegant enough to the native ears of the french owner rrb it s been a little while since i last heard the authentic tones of a frenchmanwoman so i was immediately pleased woohoo although i have not tried everything on the menu just by the look vibe and first indulgence of their sandweeeesh i will critique it now i had the parisian lrb pareezeeahn rrb baguette and it definitely did not disappoint epic pass i was very impressed on the tastiness and freshness of the ingredients the bread itself had the desirable softness and texture that i would expect from a genuine baguette lrb as i had in france rrb the saltiness of the ham the balance of the mayo the eggs and lettuce was just superb i truly enjoyed every bite i had a side of pasta which tasted kind of fresh and dressed with i thought was bleu cheese lrb i did nt clarify with them rrb for beverage i had a very good tropical tasting iced tea i thought the decor was friendly warm and inviting with french artwork while music played in the background the owner and his wife basically run the show they were very friendly and attentive i will strive to come here as often as i can so i can fine tune my french i have a feeling i will make it through most of their menu the smoked breast of duck sounded intriguing j adore duck
i have ate at the mesa tempe gilbert  scottsdale locations the mood is definitely better in the tempe and scottsdale locations all have very upbeat and exceptionally friendly staff you ca nt eat here without trying the pizookie the best by far no matter what location be prepared to wait at least mins and longer during popular dinner hours well worth your time
rachael is the best hair dresser i have ever had hands down she does my hair most of my friends hair and all of our kids she is amazing i have been seeing her for over years now and would never consider going anywhere else she has become family rrb
atoyac is an experience far beyond what the average  bertos can provide the owneroperators are very friendly and helpful with explaining the ins and outs of several menu items that are nt always immediately familiar with even native phoenicians do nt let the cheap stripmall and bare look fool you this place is much greater than the sum of its walls everything on the menu is affordable but the food and handmade drinks are crafted by dan and pablo with real care an passion familiar tacos asada are a good place to start but try the other meats even if you ve never worked up the will to try tongue or tripe before the mexican hotdog and tlayudas are musttrys too if they have horchata you must try it  it s not a powder mix and the nuts  melon added make for a very refreshing beverage as for fake reviews i do nt buy it i ve never been able to walk into a restaurant and instantly begin chatting with the other patrons about how good the food is
carmen is a very good mechanic who will not rip you off he treats you like family fair and honest
here i go first off i feel this if the best pho on the west side i ve tried them all the broth is not at all bland like some of the reviews state it s perfect the owner is a very nice man always waves when i walk in  that s good enough for me the spring rolls are awesome i think what some people are use to is how some other places put oil on their noodles that right there will give it flavor i myself workout  eat healthy so i m really conscious what i eat if you re looking for pho loaded with msg or broth that taste like sugar water then this is nt your place if you re looking for a healthy bowl of pho then this is your spot this is my opinion  i will only eat here for a bowl of pho its a min drive from my house but well worth it fyi i ca nt speak for their other dishes only their pho thanks for reading
i m not sure if durant s is really star worthy but something about it i gotta say i like a lot i also do nt know what mind boggling insightful information i can provide after plus reviews but i ll put in my cents lrb dammit here we go again with the lack of a cents key on my keyboard  typewriters have them you know rrb which will buy you nothing btw yes there s red velvet wallpaper and one could argue the interior is more like a before shot but that s part of its charm lrb charm one of those words you do nt like to read in a real estate listing much like cozy or up  coming neighborhood rrb but i think anyone over the age of i m not saying i am over mind you will appreciate the comfortable recognizable glimpse into the past it offers you i would have never seen the inside of a place like durant s as a kid since i would have either been left at home or sent to the car lrb my parents had no problems with sticking you in the car even when it was outside rrb but i can imagine this is what i missed service did start a little rocky rocky as in at least  minutes for someone to even consider taking a drink order but when i ordered a sloe gin fizz i did not get a blank stare however i m pretty sure i did not get sloe gin either there was a little overkill on the sweet so hard to tell once we were able to order a drink service was impeccable see what a drink in hand can do for you  we had oysters rockefeller which were seriously delicious and i had the scallop and filet combination scallops were perfectly seared and the filet was almost fork tender garlic mashed potatoes were not hot enough nor garlicky enough either but i forgot all about that when i saw the size of the strawberry shortcake when you re sharing size does matter so i love durant s in spite of a few shortcomings and i would happily return maybe in a few years when my dad is really old i can send his ass to the car
we took all girls to dick s for lunch yesterday we had a little trouble finding it dick s is very small and was quite busy we were lucky and they sat us at the bar without waiting this was our first visit and we really had no idea what to expect i did read the reviews and took a look at the menu so we thought it would be a good fit for us the server brought us menus and took our drink order we noticed that the cooking was taking place right in front of us at the bar the area is very small but they seemed to make it work we couldnt believe how large the servings were that the cooks were preparing we ordered and our food came to us about minutes later it was very good to say the least the atmosphere was great the food was great it is a little pricey but worth it the best way to sum it up is that my wife said if this place was closer to home we would eat here alot 
my husband and i bought a kia forte in march from salazar kia and had such a good experience lrb which was a total surprise to us because in the past car buying had been painful at best rrb that when i was in the market for a new car this year we went back salazar kia has given us truly two of the best car buying experiences in our lives they do nt play games with the price their customer service is amazing and mike bergesson our sales person was fabulous i would nt hesitate to go back to salazar for my next vehicle purchase or to recommend them to a friend
this place is great they grow alot of the food they use and if they do not grow they buy it local the food tastes great do nt forget to get a milkshake it is also a great place to sit and eat outside nice
best burger place ever my fiancee and i love innoutburger at first glance it seems like an average burger place with just a few menu items however once you know about the secret menu everything changes you can get anything from grilled onions with special sauce to lettuce wrapped burgers all absolutely delicious their fries are also amazing especially animal style i love that they use fresh ingredients and make their fries right on the spot when i want a burger innoutburger is definitely the only place i go last but not least try a neapolitan shake it will be the best shake you have ever had
i love origins their products are fantastic i love just about every product i ve ever purchased from origins lrb the blade runner shaving cream was soso and in my mind did nt justify the expense rrb i ca nt speak for the women but as a male its refreshing to have a full line of products at your disposal i would highly recommend the check and balances face wash for the guys i m a big fan of the charcoal body wash  it has such a refreshing masculine licorice smelly goodness believe me women appreciate a guy who has good hygiene i ve only been to the origins at the biltmore fashion park once but i had a wonderful experience with carrie she was very helpful and introduce me to some new products i had nt used before she gave me lots of samples too which really just puts me over the edge and keeps me coming back
it took us an hourandahalf to get into scottsdale s buca di beppo and this was right after a giants game in spring training lrb march rrb i think one of the problems was that there are very few tables for two there are tables for four tables for six or eight aplenty this is a family restaurant you know something  it was worth it absolutely incredible meal and very friendly service just a wonderful experience except for the waiting part
my family is from israel and over the years we ve enjoyed a lot of fantastic middle eastern food eden s grill has some of the best in town authentic reasonably priced and made with love and tradition i ve never had anything there that i did nt like this one of my favorite places to send people
let s put it this way i kick myself if i do nt stop at this place when i visit phoenix this is on my todo list i have taken a taxi cab to this place when i did nt have a car the chile relleno and egg foo young combo is amazing and will knock your socks off
unfortunately i am not of legal age to drink so i got a pretty legit sharpie x on my hand before entering the group i came with was sat in the back towards those huge fermenting canisters i love the atmosphere of the restaurantbar and the servers are super attentive even when the place is packed every time i ve been here their food tastes amazing and their soda is super fresh highly recommend their chicken strips dipped in beer batter mmm my mouth is watering just thinking about them you ll absolutely love their fries too
this place is the best chinese food in arizona and i ve been going since as a regular everything on the menu is fantastic but we always order fried tofu with special sauce lrb delicious silken tofu with an extremely light batter and a sweetspicy dipping sauce rrb steamed fish sauteed snow pea leaves salt and pepper pan fried shrimp after the meal they always serve a refreshing and quite frankly the best tasting almond jello ever the lunch specials are cheap and americanized but the sauces are flavorful the wait staff are friendly and awesome i ve introduced one and all my friends to this fantastic place it s the perfect place for family style meals however if you re not asian you will probably get the pink menu the blue menu has more authentic dishes which you should try after i told this to my manager he tried to get the blue menu without me there but was denied always persist because it will be worth it now if wong s could make it to san francisco i would be in heaven
great hike great views great exercise parking is terrible but it s all part of the hike
i now have a sixth sens for delicious asian tapas  a genre i never knew existed i always assumed the best tapas disappeared when aaron may sauteed sol y sombra s last batch of buttermarinated brussels sprouts well i was proven wrong when i hit up the ultracool sens asian tapas  sake on a thursday night guests are greeted by electric blue lights neon pink lotus blossom light fixtures and fresh beats courtesy of a hipster dj which transport the hungry to an intoxicating fluorescent experiens filled with sauces sakes and spicy flavors they probably do nt even know about yet i tried three topnotch items wasabi tofu  hot in every sens of the word wasabi and degree tempura crusties have the ability to burn you to your soul if you are nt careful do nt skip it just poke it with a chopstick or blow on it first white peach juice and vodka  just like japanese candy exchange students brought home in high school it s one of those miraculous flavors most americans will never have the opportunity to try light and sweet but not overly so it s a perfect blend you can sip all night long lrb i did rrb the best by far is the hot  sour soup it s nothing like the kind you get for at chinese restaurants as an appetizer a bilbo bagginsey cauldron arrives with a wooden ladle  among the various veggies and discshaped noodles is your choice of meat  i chose clams i ve always heard you can truly tell how talented a chef is by how tasty his soup is and would have to agree there s nothing to hide behind and you re confronted by pure flavor it was complex different and mouthwatering the whole sensation was so genius i even got past the embarrassment of chef johnny chu snorting in my face for taking pics of my meal on my iphone
freakin awesome a defensive end size man with the coolest easter island tattoos takes your order if you want freshly made to order food in bite size attractively priced  here is your place the flavor profile of each menu item is well thought out and balanced and delightfully not swimming in oil authentic no nonsense and well worth the trip will be back to try the tamales which were sold out

i have a serious banana republic problem rewind time to about three years ago when i bought my first dress from br i had just gotten my first full time real job after finishing college and i needed a wardrobe to match my new position it is now three years later and i have probably close to twenty dresses from br the only issue i have is they leave me pretty darn broke so when i heard br had a factory store i was stoked so last weekend i dragged my husband sister and niece down to anthem to check this place out it was crowded but the prices of the items definitely make up for it that is when you find something worth buying the selection of items is a little weird and you have to fight with many other women to get into the racks with the good stuff but i managed to find two  cotton dresses that are both casual and work appropriate at the same time priced originally at with a markdown to on the rack they also had a  off sale on these particular items that day so i scored two dresses originally totaled for for sounds like a good deal to me i wish they had more colors except that would have been bad for my credit card cause i am sure i would have ended up buying them all my husband also scored two pairs of jeans two cotton shirts and three pairs of boxers for under i can see myself making the minute drive down here at least four times a year to see what new stuff comes in my dress collection is going to get larger this year i can tell you that also if you sign up online for the factory store you can get coupons for extra  off your total purchase so your super discounted items just got even more discounted
i ve been coming to eat here since i was really small  a great family atmosphere during the day and a fun time at night one of the best places to watch major sports games
this is the first time my family has ever been to culver s and am happy to say it wo nt be the last my husband and i had a date night out on a friday night and we were tired and just wanted to grab something quick to eat and have been eyeing this place since it opened up showing up around pm lrb i believe rrb and was happy to pull up to a big bright menu we mulled it over and i grabbed a mushroom swiss burger and my hubby grabbed the shaved prime rib sandwich the burger was awesome not that it was fancy in the least but it was how you would want your burger to taste big fat patty seasoned and cooked right i enjoyed every bite and it was nt too greasy their fries i could have done without there was just nothing to them my husband bragged about his sandwhich too says it tasted great the staff was super friendly too next time i want fast food i will come to culvers
mikado is my favorite sushi place in the chandlergilbert area the fish is amazing and they often have really great stuff in like blue fin etc the chefs are really good and often make me special things that are nt on the menu the nigiri portions are very generous this is one of the two or three places where i try the specialty rolls the albacore and garlic roll is awesome also they have specialty sashimi that you should really try if you go another winner is the tempura and garlic app the deep fried garlic is actually sweet and mellow very nice the atmosphere is nice and the staff is very friendly and the prices are totally reasonable like i said before my favorite sushi spot anywhere near me
make meaning is truly a welcomed gem to the valley when i was a kid there was a store called sparkles in my area this store was a little girl s paradise because not only did they sell novelty trinkets like fun pencils erasers etc but they also offered crafting opportunities where you could decorate your own pencil cases bags boxes etc when i walk into make meaning it s like i m taken back several decades to my days at sparkles make meaning is a crafter s paradise during your visit you can decorate pottery create glass jewelery create soap lrb both fun and highend rrb create candles create glassware and decorate a gourmet cake lrb yes a real one rrb it s the perfect time to bond with friends your kids coworkers and more i recently visited with a group of friends i called ahead and made a reservation when i arrived an area was setup for us to work at once the entire group arrived the staff took us on a tour and explained each craft most of us decided on pottery including myself i decided to go with measuring cups i figured that it could nt be too hard to paint measuring cups lrb i m not so artsy when it comes to painting rrb once our group was situated with paint brushes and our craft we were off it ended up taking us several hours to complete our projects and i think it might have something to do with our age and the fact that we are now adults who feel the need to perfect our work so that we would nt be judged during the afternoon the staff offered us several snacks lrb to purchase rrb including rice krispie treats snack packs and more i also learned that they plan on getting a liquor license soon so that groups lrb who are and older rrb can drink while they work pricing wise it costs for a day pass or around for a yearlong membership after that you pay for what you make my measuring cups costs about if you see yourself coming here a lot then it s definitely worth getting the yearlong membership it s the perfect activity for kids in this heat and once you re done you can hang out at the quarter s fountains and grab a frozen yogurt or some candy form the candy shop on a side note in my group of one of the girls had a toddler with her it made me realize that it would be really cool if there was an area for little baby brothers and sisters who were nt old enough to create a craft to play in while the moms helped their older children with their crafts lrb or did one themselves rrb i ve seen this at other stores and it s so convenient for the moms
my favorite breakfast spot by far you ca nt go wrong with anything you order but my favorites are their eggs benedict their english harvest omelet and their breakfast salad it s a good family restaurant but if you are bringing a group on a weekend morning call ahead so you do nt have a long wait the staff is always great and usually the owner is there seating guests himself tip you can order reduced portions of their omelets and a half order of the breakfast salad
good food service seating games and crowd could use the sports package though
oh my gawd i am so fortunate to live just up the hill from this place yum we heard rave reviews about los reyes and could nt wait to try it it far exceeded all of our expectations everything was spot on friendly staff good fast service huge portions of delicious food and very reasonable prices i had the shrimp taco plate and my friends had the norteno pollo and mexicana tortas wow it was nearly orgasmic the aguas frescas are delicious as well good job guys i wish you much success you certainly deserve it pt th visit and took my son this time he got the carne asada torta  i had the chicken tacos yummmmmo could nt even finish our plates it was so much food  ate the rest for dinner lol drop whatever you re doing and go eat here now
no complaints always excellent quality great service and when there are crowds due to an upcoming holiday they are organized to minimize the wait i appreciate that they anticipate it and make the effort
what a nice place spread out over a hillside in the desert sanctuary resort is just that sanctuary the resort has nature all around  hummingbirds flowering everything road runners jack rabbits and more  really beautiful the rooms are exceptional my suite included a private deck with mountain views big shower with slate tile and double shower head four poster bed and flat screed tv in the main room  fireplace lrb not necessary for my midjuly nightly lows around f rrb dining room table and big lcouch in front of the in flat screen down the hill is elements bar and restaurant with great views and exceptional service the restaurant overlooks the spa pool and there during the day when temperatures are around degrees there is plenty of lemon water fresh towels and floaties one ca nt help but relax and dream my days were a mix of business and pleasure so i did nt check out the spa proper lrb or the lap pool or the workout center for that matter rrb i did find space plenty of opportunity to shed some stress however notes  one of the huge pluses is that the resort is less than a mile from echo canyon parkway lrb the trail head that has a parking lot for camelback mountain trail rrb i did manage to hike part of camel back on this trip which is good but it is not so good that i did not get to the top due to time constraints i ve hiked camelback many times and it is a must do for any visit to phoenix  i really did not mind the heat  in fact i sort of like it but this is the off season for arizona and that translates to huge value in hotels and resorts  the pool area has a no cell phone policy  which is fantastic what is not so fantastic is the moron who completely ignored it yesterday even after being asked by the staff to cease or move so while i was relaxing i got to hear his entire conversation with donna he s from the east coast  in phoenix for a few days to see the office there and is thinking bout relocating then he s off to toronto next week on business and dreams of living in san diego some day  blah blah blah hey cell phone guy  learn some manners but even that one small diversion did nt manage to pull me up and out of my stress shredding objective overall stars for a sanctuary in the desert

yumyumyumyumyum ok i really like this place i ve been searching for the perfect biscuit sandwich since i left north carolina yoli s has a delicious one that makes a carolina girl happy in the morning it s so nice to have a place for a homemade breakfast just a hop skip and a jump from the office if i ever stop obsessing over the biscuit sandwich lrb not likely rrb i want to try their breakfast burritos skillets and french toast word on the street is that those are amazing as well you can also walk here from gangplank if you stop by to work and need some good food in your belly they serve lunch as well as breakfast and i think they are open until
had to write a review because i will not let their sole review be a star review mini bar ber shop has had coming soon signs forever and it finally opened within the last month or so i think the concept is so cool and unique and i really hope it takes off for them haircuts and beers while getting your haircut  so great the haircut i ve had here was of great quality the stylistbarber really took his time and you could tell he cared about the end result they have a bunch of different options but there basic haircut  neck shave is what i got for everyone i encountered that works here was very friendly and laid back also the design and atmosphere of this place is really cool very hipmodern looking and everything is white or black there are two sides to minibarber shop the barber shop side and the actual bar side the barber shop side also has a cool little retail area with a bunch of cool gifts and funny art books for sale as well as salon products the bar side is pretty big nice long bar and also table seating beer and wine only but for beers i can definitely see myself stopping by for a few with friends even when not getting a haircut the atmosphere is cool enough that it is somewhere you actually want to sit chill and drink at they also have small sandwiches and items in the case catered by vincent s will have to try them sometime do nt let the first poor review steer you away stop by and check this place out
my partner and i just moved downtown and the roosevelt has become our hangout i love this place the staff is so friendly genuinely friendly they are also knowledgeable about wine and we have had some amazing bottles the food is also excellent my favorite is the grilled cheese and tomato soup it seems to draw a good mix of people so we do nt always feel like the oldest people in the room great place to spend an evening
i love this place i was on the hunt for the perfect ring for my woman i walked in and was greeted promptly but it was nt an immediate here buy our jewels kind of deal the folks behind the counter let me come to them and were nt pushy thank god cause i probably would have left they have really beautiful stuff here some new and some estate i found the ring several months ago but did nt make the purchase until after i had a few visits with it i wanted to make sure it was right they remembered who i was when i first came back and that means a lot to me when i made my final payment earlier this week the lady was almost as excited as me i love supporting the local folk and i hope that if and when you want some new bling you ll give this place a shot
we started with the cucumber tomato onion and parsley salad which was amazing it was super fresh and so tasty our waitress told us they do nt chop the veggies until someone orders it i had a chicken kabob lrb some of the best chicken i ve had in maybe ever rrb and an onion kabob freaking so good the onion was nice and charred and it was so much food my sister had the chicken kabob with the basmati rice that had the berries on top she said it was ridiculously good by far some of the freshest food and most flavorful food i ve had in awhile
love the outdoor fireplace on the cool winter nights it was great to sit and chat over a hot cup o sumpin it would be really nice if there was a small live music jazz trio playing next to the crackling fire pit
 common food done uncommonly well is their motto and i think it fits perfectly you ll find a lot of typical american fare but each prepared with a special twist such as the buttermilk pancakes with applewoodsmoked bacon and bleu cheese you ll also find many unique menu items such as the fontina burger which is made with roasted red pepper grilled mushrooms arugula pesto and fontina cheese whatever you decide on you can be sure it will be expertly prepared and very tasty some of my favorites are the breakfast tacos bbq chicken pizza onion rings sweet potato fries any of the salads and the malts some other really cool things to note about joe s farm grill are that much of the produce is grown in agritopia right next to the restaurant you ll find many seasonal items are from the farm as well also the building itself was the home that joe johnston grew up in it has been remodeled quite a bit but the original walls and even fireplace remain if you ve never been you must give it a try
i just had my first tammie coe cake last week for my birthday and i will never be the same again i do nt normally eat cake in fact if it s not brownies i do nt eat it but this cake drew me in with it s appealing fondant from there i got lost in the spongy richness of the cake a cornicopia of flaverful goodness so make a metal note to yourself i will only eat brownies and tamie coe cakes oh and special thanks to arts g lrb previous review rrb for telling me what the hell fondant is i was just calling it sheet like frosting

scramble has the same owners as half moon i was told which i never would ve assumed upon entering the layout is very chipotleesque but the atmosphere is upbeat and friendly my friend and i sat on the patio which you can bring your dog to if you fancy your four legged friend shedding all over your food which is nt exactly appealing to me lrb end of rant rrb moving on to the food  i ordered the veggie omelet  a coffee there are a lot of super yummy menu options including the classic sweet concoctions i opted for the healthy option since i was going hiking a few hours later but i m sure i will indulge in the infamous french toast eventually when i m wearing my comfy and forgiving sweat pants the coffee was superb as well self serve beverage area makes it so much more convenient to refill your java great place nice people easy to spot location yummy food decent prices scramble is an instant fave
great food fresh and fast
terrific credit union joined many years ago when it was still the motorola credit union the staff is very friendly lrb almost like family or friends rrb we ended up dumping bank of america in after they tried to upgrade my mastercard card to an unwanted lrb and useless rrb american express card started to mess around with how they reported our mortgage balance and actually gave money out of my account to someone who was not on my account all of our savings checking money markets iras etc are now with truwest

i have only dealt with michael but he has been awesome if you did nt know better you would nt think he is an accountant by his personality he is so very personable and savvy he not only does taxes but he has helped me with business acquisitions and other complicated tax issues i ca nt say enough good about him i highly recommend him to anyone

we all know mattress shopping can be a bit of a pain unless we know exactly what we want which i did nt after laying on a few i asked for a recommendation  and got a great one they had a mattress on sale for while it was more pricey than i had originally planned the mattress came with a year warranty and he threw in a free bed frame as well as an excellent mattress pad with a year warranty plus the mattress is incredibly comfy which was necessary for me since i fractured my back a few months ago and was having a hard time finding something that worked well with my back issues thx sleep america
oh my god i heard all the rumors about how wonderful but had nooooo idea until i tried it for the first time i had to use caps to discuss my love for innout burger i tried it for the first time  double animal style with fries and chocolate shake  i went for it cut out he bada bing and just had the boom i was so nervous ordering but the lad was so kind and cute and probably like  years old i m in love i really am i would get on a plane tomorrow again just to fly to get innout
this place is awesome great quality meats dry rubs smoking woods you pay more for the meat than you would at fry s but you get what you pay for i highly recommend the az cardinal brats
maybe it s because i am from the east coast but i do nt see the love for innout burgers since everyone is comparing them here is my cents five guys burgers are hand formed and taste way more like beef than the thin tiny burgers at innout you can also get pretty much any topping you can think of at five guys the real stand out is the fries i recommend getting them with cajun as that makes them truly amazing no matter what size fires you get they give you a ton of them more than enough to share for what you get i do nt see how five guys is really that more expensive than any of the other burger places around here a regular burger here is a double patty burger and very large i usually get a small burger and that s just fine
my local spot for things i can not get at walmart
i love this place hubby and i have been here a few times each time was wonderful awesome food cool bartenders and wait staff always smiling and helpful last night we went and were seated by a couple of cool ladies we struck up a conversation and found out one was the mother of the gm daniel after they were done with their meal daniel walked them to their car i thought that was so sweet taking care of his mom and her friend fan for life the vibe there is always fun and the music rocks
bookmans is the mecca of bookstores seriously there is nt a better bookstore anywhere that i ve lived all of the people who complain that bookmans did nt buy their stuff obviously do nt understand the concept of a place like this  if they need it they buy it obviously if they have copies of  the time traveller s wife they are nt going to buy yours i honestly love everything about bookmans true it is slightly dingy but that is part of the charm you can buy pretty much any book you could dream of for  the price you would at barnes  noble or any other bookstore but book are nt the end of what they sell magazine movies music games video game systems art pretty much anything used that is in good condition and someone else might want they carry bookmans is a personal obsession i would peruse every day if i still lived there i also think that their purchasing system is more than fair i have gone many times and sold old books or video games that i was done with and have felt the creditcash they gave me was acceptable there have also been times that i took bags full of books like everyone else is complaining about and had them buy nothing but i realize that this is part of the business i honestly think there should be a bookmans in every large city on the globe life would be better and certainly world peace would follow
this place reminds me of the little donut places in nyc the donuts are fresh no matter what time you go and they re open hours a day days a week who does that in az yay
just had lunch at bobby q we had the sample platter which came with beef brisket one side st louis ribs and smoked chicken lrb which we substituted for more beef brisket rrb and the beef brisket sandwich everything was incredibly good our server saw that we were sharing the strawberry lemonade and ignoring the iced tea so brought out another strawberry lemonade free of charge we were served corn bread as we waited for our food which came out super fast all that and our bill was only i definitely recommend this place and if you tell them you found them on yelp you get  off your bill

went to sidebar a few weeks ago as part of my attempt to broaden my horizons when it comes to going out aka going out anywhere else other than old town it s a shame i do nt live downtown because it definitely is one of my favorite bars in phoenix now the atmosphere is perfect i m a big fan of chill establishments like this i love going to a chill loungey barclub where i can drink socialize listen to awesome music and even dance if i wanted to and not have to push people out of my way to get from one side to the other sidebar is that place the decor is hip and modern and totally is not your typical scottsdalephoenix joint the music is outstanding at least it was the night i was there awesome house music something that is often hard to find in this city sidebar feels like the type of bar you find in a  real city london comes to mind drinks are also made really well and they have a huge variety of good beers and good spirits absinthe fountain included again very big cityeuropean feel and as many of the reviews have said the crowd is hip but unpretentious and nondouche baggy the place just has an outstanding vibe highly recommend sidebar if you like the above

this is one of the coolest new places i ve been to first of all they re dog friendly which is nice in fact you can do more than just bring your dog you can have their birthday party here they seriously have doggie birthday party packages that include treats like pupcakes and mutt muffins but if you feel like just bring your dog without a birthday celebration you can still buy them a healthy treat while you sip on a raw juice i think the concept of this juice bar is really awesome nature gives us everything we need to take care of ourselves but normally we are nt putting raw or live foods into our bodies here the juice is all fresh and made only with the pure ingredients of fruit or vegetables you can get a juice that contains or so vegetables like beets spinach parsley etc and it actually tastes good if you want to feel healthier and do something good for your body come here instead of jamba and bring your four legged friend too

my wife and i stopped in here on saturday night after the dbacks game and were told there would be an hour and half wait the very visually frazzled hostess kept her composer and let us know that the bar area is first come first serve so we decided to try there we scored some seats within minutes and were immediately met by sarah the bartender and the smiles and service never stopped based on our questions sarah knew it was our first time and really explained their menu and how everything works our whisky was a glass but based on the long pour it was worth it there was a mistake in the kitchen and someone miss ordered a crab legs we scored because sarah brought them to us to try amazing i ordered a sampler trio as our appetizer and the wife loved it all until she realized it was not breaded chicken and little chunks of lobster in the seafood fondue lrb i may have led her on a little rrb but rather alligator and crawfish the smile on her face lrb maybe the whisky rrb or just the general fun atmosphere and the food quality was well worth the total bill at the end of the night i ca nt wait to go back
i ate at atlas bistro two nights in a row while in scottsdale at a conference the surroundings of the restaurant are less than appealing but once inside all was forgotten the food is among the best i ve ever tasted the ability to choose from an extensive wine selection from the wine store next door is great it works out to be a great value i was steered here by the zagat guide and it certainly did not steer me wrong three different prix fixe selections are available from a seven course  tasting menu down to a three course meal prices were extremely reasonable for the quality of the food  for three courses for for  courses everything we tasted was absolutely wonderful from the quarter free range rabbit appetizer to the chili peppers in aoli sauce to the seafood stew highly recommended
this place is fantastic  full service grocery of persianmediteranean products delicious food readytoeat at the cafe why pay more to go anywhere else  baiz has what you need pita hummus baklava falafel tahini mmmmm
easily one of my favorite places in urban phoenix i am a member and we go often what is there not to like  its unique it changes there are events by a bundle even food is semi ok for such place go there no i mean it go stroll through major roads venture to some smaller once talk to those nice elderly lrb for the most part rrb volunteers who will teach you about surviving on prickly pears or how succulent is different from a cactus do not liter run around or yell like an idiot please besides that  have fun this place is awesome i like very nice eugene
reminds me of back home in chicago love the atmosphere great greasy food but they even have turkey burgers
finally a teriyaki bowl place that does it right nothing against samuri sam s but yogis is a bit better in my opinion yogis menu is strait forward and clearly lists the options available the place is clean and the staff is fast and friendly the food is also very reasonably priced i was very impressed with their different bowlplatesalad options you are able to order some teriyaki veggies chicken andor beef pretty much however you want it extra meat over lettuce over veggies brown rice white rice etc anyway when i visit a place like this my desires are simple i want a decent portion of notoverlysauced white meat chicken over a bunch of veggies that s it yogis delivers this and then some
daily dose  yes please the menu has something wonderful for every palate and food preference the staff is always friendly and responsive their drink specials are phenomenal my favorite is brunch time  you ca nt go wrong with any omelet or my favorite  the protein and iron the dd hash is legit daily dose is our proverbial goto whenever we are in the area
the best great guy great service great price no long paragraph needed
awesome produce at great prices their produce guy even treated me to samples of a white peach and pluot  just took his knife and cut a slice of each for me talk about customer service also love their bulk granola and good selection of beauty products
this is the best sushi ever we eat here at least once a week and love it the fish portions are large and the price is reasonable i send people there all the time and they love it the staff is great and the sushi bar is usually very fun must try the house smoked salmon it is amazing make sure it is not the regular smoked salmon the pink panda roll is amazing too it is not on the menu but the sushi guys know what it is
wow i just got my nails done here and let me tell you it s amazing before they did nt do shellacs but now they do for shellac plus manicure it s but just a gel polish change it s for their gelish it s with manicure or for gel polish change removal of gel only is other places i go to charge for shellac and removal so in a way you d be saving more money coming to top design as for their service they are really nice give great messages and just really excellent overall they are friendly and act like you re part of the family they also do waxing and alterations here i love it soo much here i ll probably always come back here by far the best nail salon i ve been too rrb
i had one of the best sandwiches ever at orange table i believe it was the prosciutto mozzarella yummmm prosciutto fresh mozzarella tomatoes fresh basil with a light balsamic vinegar between slices of sourdough bread each layer of the sandwich was very distinct yet the combined medly made my mouth sing a friend could nt decide between the roast beef sandwich or the green chile corned beef hash so he got both the sandwich was pretty good but the corned beef was divine slightly crispy but not hard they ran out of orange juice so we had freshly squeezed lemonade everything was terrific and the service was great highly recommended
gotta love sweet republic great philosophy and great icecream and sorbets i ve loved every single flavor i ve had there lrb peanut butter brownie swirl mint chip salted butter caramel mayan chocolate and more rrb everything is made from all natural fresh ingredients lrb virginia peanuts fresh mint leaves etc rrb when i really want to splurge i make my own sundae you get to pick two flavors of icecream a sauce and a topping if you have nt been to sweet republic go if you re far from shea  find them at first fridays downtown farmers markets and more
awesome subs clean and friendly well priced
this is a tiny surprise in an otherwise unassuming chandler strip mall no it s not the most beautiful locale but then decorations are not why we go to a restaurant it s the food and the service both of which at thai paradise are exceptional we have been to this lovely oasis several times now and have never had a bad experience lrb including the time i mistakenly ordered my drunken noodle thai hot which was wonderful if firey rrb all of the curries are wonderful but panag curry stands out a broad menu with many different types of homemade dishes prepared with skill and love sets thai paradise apart from it s contemporaries the lunch time specials include a lovely soup that is simple but that you find yourself wanting more of it is difficult to choose any one dish to praise here since all of the meals we ve enjoyed here have been wonderful with nothing tarnishing any of our visits the owners are very friendly and only too happy to explain about anything on the menu all of their dishes can be ordered either mild medium hot or thai hot this last should be dared only by true lovers of heat because while it never drowns the the flavors like at other thai places it is intensely hot i myself perfer the hot while my wife is pleased by the medium truely everyone can enjoy thai food with no fears of searing their lips shut gather your friends together and visit thai paradise you wo nt even remember it s in a strip mall we never do
every time i go to yc s i always have a great experience service is great food is good place is always clean the price is the best because it s not expensive but the food is awesome making your own sauces is a fun experience also
this last week i had my girlfriends surprise birthday party at vincent s market bistro the food the atmosphere and the service were all great as everyone else mentioned the croissants they serve are delicious and very euro like the menu is somewhat limited but they also had a pre fixe menu for dinner which is a great option as well the atmosphere is very cozy and has a great euro feel to it what i was most impressed with was the service our waiter was very knowledgable and patient but the thing that really sealed the deal was the cute little birthday dessert they made for my girlfriend only to be shortly followed with a similar complimentary plate for everyone else at the table we will definitely be coming back
the first i even went here was for my birthday in nov it was actually a first for my entire party me and my bffs pretty much have made this place our spot for girls night out food is great staff is friendly oh and the bathroom is awesome lol
fantastic venue the bartenders are nice  the drinks are excellent the lounge is an amazing place to hang out lrb best downtown spot  rrb even if you are nt going to the show cool free shows in the lounge now let s talk about the main reason you would go there  the music and the venue itself is awesome the sound is great the room is great it was designed by someone who knew what concert goers want  an intimate experience with fantastic sound and so if you have the curse of always standing behind the tallest dudes ever at shows  you can now take advantage of the bleacher seating in the back of the room or benches on the side there is not a bad seat in the house what is left to say  get there
great place to heal old childhood trauma and get that cabbage patch doll you never got as a kid i love you bookman s if you consider a bookstore to be your saving salvation then you will love it here when you walk in it usually smells like bacon or panini s or whatever the heck they are cooking up in the cafe you can sit in the cafe area and get a lemon bar but they also have many other baked goods and sandwiches to choose from they have old records and a bunch of old crazy crap in the back that you will love the kids section has a cute little entry way just for kids and they sell toys puzzles and games they also have old vintage action figures from movies and shows pretty much any book you could be looking for they probably have which is all categorized so it is easy to find if you can not find it though they will be happy to help you in your quest they have a manga section and located just off of the cafe section they have magazines and comics i found old creep comics that were that are really worth they have a porno collection in an armoire but everyone can see you look into it so most guys look awkwardly into it for a minute before walking away books are reasonably priced and the price can be found penciled in the book on the first page on the upper right hand corner they have a gaming section where you can buy games and old gaming systems like the original nintendo make sure you make time to look near the registers that is where they have the really interesting stuff
keith brent and staff rocked it again last night oz prime rib cooked to perfection such an awesome place rrb
back again great as usual we will be returning regulars to this place
i love this church near the light rail and really pretty it actually looks like a cathedral lots of parking pretty inside and really clean mass at pm on a sunday
i have been to every ballpark in the cactus league and know my way around them all this is by far the best facility in all of spring training lrb that includes the florida parks rrb granted i am a dodger fan and we get it better than the  sox fans do but it is still amazing camelback ranch is the brand new state of the art spring training facility for the dodgers and white sox the sox moved from tucson because tucson is the literally so bad that even people from chicago wo nt stay there the park is located just south of the glendale airport and pretty much only has one way in or out  th ave you can avoid camelback rd by taking indian school to th and then just drive into the stadium the grounds feature practice fields and a giant lake and river that also help irrigate the fields while the white sox practice fields and clubhouse entry are blocked off from the public the dodgers are wide open and inviting players must walk through the crowds during practices which invited lots of interaction with the fans the field is beautiful and the layout of the stadium is quite impressive not only do they have a full jumbotron but they also feature fully enclosed suites and a full buffet for those willing to shell out per game that price gets you seats behind home access to unlimited food wine beer soda and sweets it also gets you exclusive merchandise as well as cold towels to help you cool off it sounds like a lot but it turns out to be worth the money the grass seats have a great slope to them lrb much like scottsdale rrb and the seat aisles are wide the food selection is lacking without dodger dogs however the stadium is also missing the independent food vendors that maryvale and peoria feature a great stadium and surely one to visit every march
a friend told us about good south indian food at woodlands and she was right it s a fast food place so if you are looking for a fancy restaurant this is not it but if you are looking for good food efficient and polite service in a family setting you ve found it we ordered south indian thalli it was great the rasam was to die for definitely recommended and we re definitely going back to try the rest of the menu
blackened shrimp  crawfish fondeaux what more do i need to say this was the first thing i tried at pappadeaux s and i have ordered it every time since from the fried seafood menu the pappadeaux platter is great and there is enough food for if you get an appetizer to start unless you are real hungry
we took our kitten to this wonderful lowcost vaccination service and could not be more pleased it was mobile and there was no wait even a short walk from light rail the staff was kind gentle and very loveable to our adorable baby they even had a small litter box for use got an unannounced tour of the aawl facility that was excellent all the animals seemed happy and healthy if i were going to be adopting another animal i would get it here
i have a breville juicer and love to make different combos of fruit and vegetable drinks this accounts for probably about meals a week for me so to be able to get such quality at such a great price for organic fruits and veggies is a huge bonus they also carry all my favorites like almond milk greek yogurt incredible beer and wine selection and lots of bulk items like nuts quinoa organic oats dried fruits etc i love the health and beauty section as well very clean store friendly and helpful staff great prices and open every day from am  pm
after a very filling dinner my hubby  i decided to stop by sweet republic for some dessert to go since they were closing soon this was our st time here so we sampled a few different flavors before making our selections my hubby went with strawberry buttermilk in a waffle cone with sprinkles on top i was not quite ready for dessert yet so everything else i ordered was to go a pint of salted butter caramel madagascar vanilla  peanut butter chip ice cream sandwiches a bag of housemade marshmallows  a bag of sea salt caramels lrb see photo rrb i know i know that s a lot of sweets but hey we live in north phoenix so i knew we would nt be stopping by again anytime soon honestly every single thing was amazing i must go back  try more because i m pretty sure anything you get here is delish total for all that was about  it was the best i ve ever spent oh  i almost forgot to add they packed bags of ice with our goodies to insure they would nt melt on our minute drive home awesome customer service
i was introduced to santan brewery two years ago on a very cold winter evening my cousin knew i would instantly fall in love with this place simply because i just love fine craft beer he was surely right because i visit santan three times a week because i simply can not get enough of their beer selection it s like an adventure every time i go the staff is fantastic not because they re very nice and friendly but they have the same passion and enthusiasm for fine craft as i do so relating to them in that respect makes the experience fantastic i normally do not engage in writing reviews on websites like this simply because i personally tell the management team my best regards but i will for this because people really do need to experience the joys this brewery has to offer santan is the new level of drinking and dining experience it s relaxed fun mature environment and you can start a conversation with anyone there enough reading this review go try it out yourself
i stopped in here because i hate tea but i really want to like it the atmosphere was nice and the employees were friendly when i explained that i never drink tea they made me something fruity and delicious that has made me determined to go back and be a little more daring the only problem i wish they had a little more space to accommodate groups and i wish they opened a little earlier so i could stop in before work regarding the other reviews it  does  seem kind of out of place but i appreciate that there are some locallyowned businesses in a shopping mall like tempe marketplace lrb i think the clothing boutique next door to tea infusion is an arizonaowned business as well rrb
scottsdale fashion square is the king of shopping centers in arizona it s unrivaled and it maintains it s crown through constant improvements expansions and new stores empty stores are rare try that on for size pv mall the food court is decent but a wide variety of restaurants surround the mall providing the shopper with an endless amount of stores and a great selection of places to eat scottsdale fashion square aims to please the most critical and goes above and beyond all expectations
i love the brushes and many of the eyeshadows the makeup dries too hard and emphasizes facial lines but the other products very nice i just wish they could do the makeover quickers so you dont have to sit there and get a sales pitch i like to pop in get some ideas for new eyeshadow combo s and get out to another store i dont want to pitch a tent and camp out in there for an hour i love the blonde guy who works at fs location he is awesome with color choices he is quick too but he is usually pretty busy and popular
they take care of me at the vig my local hot spot where i take my clients sometimes after their massage with me the food is always fresh the servers are continually delightful and my clients leave with a full belly and happy happy hour is grand from to pm you can get plump juicy chicken wings with blue cheese and celery sticks for only i adore the wines and they are only the vig azz burger is yummy yes i like meat  rrb veggies too yet the burger is cooked to order fresh condiments huge onion rings and the buns are soft  i am hungry for it right now 
great little store i went today for the first time and i am very pleased the store was immaculate and very organized they had a terrific selection at amazing prices other stores of this type are great but this one stands out to me because of the brands cleanliness and the owners the owners were very sweet and took time to ask if we were looking for anything in particular and while i was walking around looking she kept coming up and placing what i put together in the dressing room for me so i did nt have to carry it around i know that for example homecoming or formal dresses can be quite expensive and switch it provides quite a large selection of dresses formal or casual i will be going back there many times in the future a great store if you are looking for great styles and brands on a budget
let us begin by dissecting the word yogurt yo  traditional urban greeting often accompanied by a high five or complicated handshake gu  short name for the chinese bangu or flowerpot drum rt  abbreviation for retweet the act of posting on twitter what another already has usually as a sign of approval therefor the word loosely means hello bangin stuff of which i approve in a world where froyo has become a trend mojo does it right the yogurt is delicious and the flavors are swapped out often so you never get bored the toppings are fresh and yummy the staff is great where they really hit the spot though is their customer servicemarketingsocial media follow  mojoyogurt on twitter and you will get a link to the password for half priced treats on tuesday you will also get interaction i actually received gift certs for interacting and giving feedback from my experiences and and they directly addressed my marshmallow cream issue seriously no one does it better
dick s is one of my top all time favorite restaurants the ambiance  intimate dark rustic wood copper sitting at the bar watching your food being cooked right in front of you the rack of lamb is sublime the taos combo or anything on the special board especially seafood is always incredible their margaritas cocktails wine  all great bacon wrapped shrimp ftw they come on a plate with a tortilla on the bottom rice beans and sauce on top and the bacon wrapped shrimp on top of that the salad which comes with many entrees is awesome and do nt forget the flan topped with prickly pear syrup you ca nt go wrong it s a testament to how good this place is that they do nt need a sign
where walgreens at mcdowell  indian school on th ave did nt have cvs did and great customer service and lower prices goodbye walgreens  hello cvs
perfect really
if you are looking for local culture this is it as a recent transplant to phoenix i really enjoyed my visit to the museum and learned a lot about the local native american cultures this is also a must visit when people visit you in phoenix what i especially love about this museum is that it presents the native american cultures as living breathing peoples and not in a museum  under glass sort of manner there is a lot of information here and it is presented clearly and coherently
i am a new client i found keli to be very porfessional and sweet
very good pizza highly recommended also someone commented on here that they have closed down they certainly have not just went there for the first time yesterday lrb  rrb and will definitely be going back rrb

my husband and i stayed here during a house hunting trip we were surprised how nice it is it s very clean friendly and helpful staff and quiet we ll be heading back again soon and plan to stay there before our things arrive we could find somewhere closer to our home but this place is so nice we figure it s worth the extra minutes drive
imagine the perfect place to chill in an airport now imagine sauce  pizza  wine and forget the airline lounge true we live in a world of imperfection i had to request a menu in order to take my time and order as they do nt offer a waiting service however after ordering the food and drinks i was quite satisfied drinks were very reasonable and the food was excellent i highly recommend the mediterranean pizza lrb basil tomatoes and cheese rrb and the bruschetta the pizza is thin but enough to split for two and the bruschetta is voluptuous with drizzled balsamic vinaigrette to die for when ordering another beer i did nt expect the cashier to start flirting with me lrb a bit unprofessional if you ask me rrb but they got the job done overall it is with genuine enthusiasm that i suggest dumping the airline lounge for sauce  pizza  lounge
so i started cosmetology school and each month we can go to the art museum and get extra hours for school and we now have officially incorporated cibo into our monthly art museum visit for school we love cibo everytime we go in everyone is amazing this last time in particular was just amazing we got matt as our serverhe s amazing he takes such great care of his guests and i was so excited to get to have him again he s like a celebrity and does nt eve know it now that the weather is cooling off we sat outside drank some wine enjoyed lots of yummy food i love the funghi with salami and one of my friends got the calzone bombdotcom rrb of course we got dessert and again mind blowing see you all next month for some amazing food service and atmosphere xxoo
picazzo s has a fantastic gluten free menu the staff are all very knowledgeable and go out of their way to accommodate people with food issues many people that i know with celiacgi try to avoid going during peak hours to avoid contamination so i ve always had great service and limited to no wait time and my food has been fantastic every time i ve been there it is a bit pricey for pizza but it s so nice to be able to eat out safely would love to open a location in austin as i do nt live in az anymore but whenever i m there i always make a trip
simply the best the dogs are grilled not boiled so they have that awesome backyard taste to them avoid lunch rush or you ll be in line for a very long time but if you have the time it s well worth it to see your dog cooked right before your eyes and dressed the way you want it
this is an incredible store i will give it a full review later
we stayed for a week with two kids a dog and two cats so yes very pet friendly great pool nice employees and excellent free breakfast  saved us a good deal of money just on that meal alone computer and printer access coffee and water available all day comfortable beds clean room pricey i suppose but well worth it for this family relocating from california rrb
i drive miles to get to this place but not for grocery in side the grocery store there is a little food corner just chairs nothing to talk about but food is the best korean food i have ever had in america the lady who cooks  she is so good her cooking reminds me of my mom s cooking i go there at least once a month to get my korean food and side dishes she also makes different side dishes  they are always fresh and good awesome little place to taste the real korean food  cheap and good each dish is less than but better than any of korean restaurant
have you ever been really drunk off a small amount  say one drink  and you feel just absolutely horrible and want to die  nahh me either but just in case this does happen and you are at say the clubhouse watching a show you can scoot your bum over to los favoritos and have your life saved yummmm does not begin to describe the food x that of any  bertos i mean that lrb sorry julio rrb they even put french fries inside dallas g s burrito i have never seen him so happy ever plus when i said i was vegan and gf the chick said well get a bean taco do you know how long it usually takes to explain to someone that i just want a bean taco no meat no cheese just a bean taco that s right just beans so major kudos to her for grasping the concept that there are freaks like me in the world who do nt eat animal products i used to eat their breakfast burritos as well their potatoes are fabulous stop what you are doing and go now
i was out and about running errands in chandler i really needed to eat something so driving along to my next appt i just thought i would stop at the next place i saw this was it italian food is always good right when i first walked in it smelled wonderful i decided on a slice cheese with mushrooms i need to wash my hands so into the bathroom it was very clean and nicely stocked which was good considering the lunch rush had just ended i had brought lemon water with me and i do not drink soda so i just got the slice i got a side of sauce which was free can i just say wow i have now found the best pizza in the valley i have never really found too many places here in phoenix and surrounding area that have good pizza so i am very happy i also noticed they ariancini balls lrb something you do not find very often rrb i asked the girl if they were for dinner or a special order no you can get them any time i told mario that night and we are going to go there for dinner the next night i do not know how they taste but the pizza and sauce were really good i looked up the website and they are a family owned and operated business from new york real italians real food just shows how you can stumble on something really good without expecting it i did notice that they had free wifi also lots of parking in the lot they do have delivery during certain hours and some great lunch specials for pick up and dine in the lunch specials are from  monday thru friday
i ve been to haiku grill many times and can definitely recommend it as a good place to eat i normally order a chicken veggie bowl with allwhite meat and brown rice their brown rice usually comes out really good lrb not an easy task for most places rrb and the chicken and veggies are tasty today i decided to try their maki and ordered the spicy tuna rolls spicy tuna rolls is my favorite sushi but i ve had bad sushi in the past and i m always a little wary to try it at new places however i had noticed lots of other people eating sushi here during my previous visits and from what i could tell they enjoyed their meals i was happily surprised with the quality of the sushi at haiku grill the rolls were a good size lrb other places i ve gone to make them too large to easily fit in your mouth rrb and had a good amount of fish in them my one complaint would probably be that the roll was nt very spicy the edamame was very good as well on another plus the staff is very friendly and i ve never had a case of bad service if you re in a hurry go for the chicken bowl as i had to wait about twice as long for my rolls and i saw orders for chicken and beef bowls that were placed after my order come out before mine not a complaint but something to keep in mind you can always call in your order too haiku grill  made of win
one of my favorite downtown restaurants it seems many people feel this way consequentially the weekend nights can be pretty slammed expect to wait a good half hour but its well worth it and besides you can get the evening started out right with a glass of wine from the bar i love the intimate yet sleek atmosphere there is exposed brick walls and beams on the ceiling vintage yet modern interior great lighting and little candles everywhere the exterior is just as inviting we opted for the chicken flatbread and pork chile verde both of which were really excellent and fairly inexpensive for the quality and vibe of the restaurant i think this is one of my favorite things about st francis you feel like you should be paying more than  for a meal but then the bill comes and you are pleasantly surprised so guys remember st francis when you are choosing a date locale its super cute looks to be on the fancier side but wo nt break the bank
i discovered this little gem of a place with my coworker on our lunch hour we were very pleasanly surprised and we have been coming ever since one of the best burgers i have had in a looong time try the brule or the bacon cheese burger omg so tasty and the seasoned fries are yummy too i m a big fan of local spots and this one is just great try it
for an old school burger and shake this place is great i still have yet to try their hot dogs and onion rings burgers are simple and greasy the fries are fresh cut and delicious i ve had the vanilla chocolate and peanut butter  chocolate shake some of the best milk shakes i have ever had their lemonade is also fresh beware if you like your lemonade sweet cause their is very tangy anyways great place for a greasy burger and fries rrb
i have memories that make my mouth water my mother calls me everytime she passes through phoenix to ask me where this place is she tells her friends in los angeles to come here if they have business or family trips to phoenix they all rave after their experience the fry bread house is as authentic as it gets indian tacos fry bread with sugar and oh my god  the red chili stew i think i just drooled a little on my keyboard the place does get a little cramped during meal times but we used to take ours to go and sit in the park after a bike ride down central and picnic away and then do our best to ride it off afterwards so we were nt wallowing in the guilt of our deep fried pleasures make sure they are open before you make the trek they have funky hours
great new york style pizza
i agree we should have tried it a lot sooner great food every thing is very fresh the chicken gorganzolla is made with a real cream sauce you can taste that clearly the fried calmari were tender and delicate very friendly and competant service
my son just had his soccer game here and what a great field this is the grass is so bouncy and great for soccer there are plenty of bathrooms and a playground parking is ample one downfall is there is no shade just bring a big umbrella and you ll do fine
chase field really is my favorite stadium in az i shall always refer to it as the bob though this shows my age quite a bit the stadium is clean modern has a diverse selection of fooddrinks and lrb yep rrb air conditioned at times i feel this is one of the few things arizona has really done well in terms of sports they updated the team uniforms entire stadium logo etc a while back and then updated the stadium to match the bricks flawless lawn retractable roof large size and friendly staff make it tough to say anything bad about it now where are the patronsfans  there were about on a friday night which a staff member told me was a great turnout wow because the place felt a bit like a ghost town there were so many empty seats that i felt as if we were hours early for the game or something i understand a huge percentage of people that live in az have come from other states and tend to follow those particular teams however this was just sad perhaps managementowners ought to consider some more family specials charity tickets or groupons to fill this great stadium up and build a stronger fan base after all the diamondbacks are fighting for st place in the division at this time
i have been going here on and off for the past years it is just a minute bike ride for me from home or minutes when walking jack my dog everyone here is friendly and attentive it has a cozy family atmosphere and they actually remember your name after your first or times coming in i usually just have a drip coffee but have to admit that it is always tasty never too strong or too weak the pastry case always looks awesome they have a variety of coffee drinks from hot cold to frozen they also have sub sandwiches and artisan sandwiches as well i highly recommend the curried chicken salad sandwich the recipe is actually bill s mothers you gotta check this place out i give all of my thumbs up
great food great prices great hookahs great shisha selection nuff said but really if you live in tempe and have a hookah hobby do yourself a favor and visit this place you will be pleasantly surprised by all the hookah gear they carry if hookah is nt your thing then come for the food their chicken shawarma sandwich with fries is delicious and affordable
culinary dropout is a fantastic place to eat the interior is very rocker complete with stage for bands interesting and yummy food with an array of beers and amazing food if you decide to go lrb which i do nt know why you would nt rrb try their monkey bread for dessert it is to die for
i have had a love affair with postino now for over a year he never does me wrong unlike some other guys i have dated anyway the best time to come is on monday or tuesday at about this way you will get seated at around when magical o clock happens this when you can pay for a board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine seriously the deal is so great you will find yourself getting three of these pairings and postino will gain all there money back but nevermind that let s dwell on the bruschetta my favorite is the prosciutto the tomato jam mozzarella with tomato basil and brie and apples are always quite stellar they also have this new burrata with bacon that should make a welcome addition to my usual board rotation ca nt go wrong with the wines but ask your server for a recommendation as the men in plaid lrb yes all the men wear plaid rrb are usually never wrong if you are so lucky as to come on a day when they are serving corn chowder then you must high five your future self by ordering a bowl oh yea the patio is amazing with the fireplace and their giant bar is both inside and outside and the inside has all the couches and intimate lighting and wine racks the only downsides are the necessary valet and the ugly circle k across the street
i love chino bandido for several reasons the black beans are strange but tasty the chinese bbq pork and emerald chicken never fail to please me who could nt love the amazing snickerdoodles  lrb my favorite cookie by the way and they do it justice rrb when i am feeling a bit indecisive this is the ideal place plus the staff are super nice and are willing to explain anything or set you up with a sample to try new things definitely a favorite of mine
in short amazing fresh food at a good price and awesome customer service to boot i went here by accident but probably the best accident ever if there is such a thing it s unassuming and simple even the menu is nt elaborated i think items total it looks like just another chicken bowl place wrong it s anything but that the food was amazing they use really fresh ingredients seasoning is perfect you do nt get the cardboard chicken doused with teriyaki sauce like other places texture and doneness of the meat was perfect i tried the combination plate which had rib eye beef chicken lots of vegetables a slaw style salad and half an orange the portions are huge and filling and the prices are great too and i love their emphasis on good healthy food this is great place for a fast lunch or a good healthy meal
this is the greatest place to eat on earth
no complaints here the best workout if you are looking for something to kick your butt nothing better than buring calories in the great outdoors
this has become our go to place for fast food beats the heck out of any burger place and the employees are great
i d never been to a chickfila before but i expected it to be like any other fast food place boy was i in for a surprise we were greeted coming in the door and the people that helped us were quick and very nice they even brought our food out to us my son had a blast playing in their little toddler area too with service and an atmosphere like that lrb not to mention the food was really good rrb how could you not go back 
yummmmmmmmmmmmm we went here on mothers day and man am i glad we had reservations even with reservations we still had to wait at least minutes to be seated they were hoppin in there once we were seated our wiatress was quick to take our drink order i ordered the griddled corn cakes and that has all i have thoguht about since taking my last bite they were beyond amazing i have never been here for brunch before but think i will need to go back very soon such a great brunch to honor an awesome mother in law

as a massage therapist i normally would rather have a massage than get adjusted that was before dr hunt came to town i trust him implicitly and the techniques he uses are amazing i take my four year old to see him too who always greets dr hunt and larissa with great big hugs highly recommend this office truly feels like family

why oh why do they not have a single decent hamburger joint in chicago i was just at in n out last weekend with a friend and stuffed my face with glorious greasy in n out burger and animal styled fries mmm artery clogging deliciousness i love this place its timeless you go back after a week a month a year the quality is still spot on you get exactly what you ordered  and that is what makes this place what it is i cant wait to come back
loved this place did a search for a place nearby to eat something different seen this place had nice reviews and close and we my wife and i liked a vietnamese place near our old home so thought it would be good to check out the people were really friendly and helpful wife had asked how to pronounce a few things in there language and she seems excited to share with us and then would tell us how to say each thing they brought to the table it was fun she would make sure we pronounced it all correctly before moving on to each new word the food was wonderful i had a wife was like a or something and son got a she then taught us the proper way to prepare to our taste each thing we ordered and how to eat them we shared around the table what we each got and all of it was great oh do nt forget to get the coffee if your a coffee lover its almost like having a nice little dessert drink with your meal service even though very busy was quick and very friendly we had at least four people stop to make sure we had everything we wanted prices were good but the food was outstanding we will be back for sure to sample more items soon
yelp did it again it helped me locate this fantastic bagel shop i was on a visit trip to visit the bff and her fianc we read the reviews and decided to try this joint out my first reaction the bagels are huge i had the whole wheat mixed topping bagel with honey almond cream cheese others ordered sun dried tomato with plain cream cheese and blueberry with plain cream cheese great comments about the sun dried tomato bagel the blueberry bagel was okay honey almond cream cheese was great probably can be a little more sweet but no complaints mixed topping was salty but the honey almond balanced it out the bagels did not disappoint  in addition to the size it was soft and fresh the service was great two bagels with cream cheese and two coffees will run you about  dollars seating area is abundance and crowded on weekends we used the mention yelp and get free bagels a lady was gracious and thanked us for checking the place out definitely a place to go for some good bagels
my first attempt to try this place out was on a sunday it is closed on sundays bummer so had lunch and it was great really really great the food is simple delicious and sticks to ya ya know what i mean  the flavor is hard to describe probably because i have not had such fresh tasty mexican food like this ever so would i ever stop and have lunch here at a gas station if i did not hear that it was so great or have seen them on the food network  no but i will definitely make the trip back the number was the tacos with beans and rice i had a chicken and beef and both were equally tasty i added the salsa to the tacos and it just added more flavor to the whole experience and i had to give it stars so to help push up the  stars it is averaging
great job okay not on the first time i stopped and had my harley truck worked upon but this review is upon the awesome customer service and the making things right the second visit to your shop i commend you on being truthful and forward about how it was a botched repair the first time and that you were willing to correct the problem i even followed up a couple weeks later with sandwichesdinner for your staff as a thank you hope you enjoyed them they were my favorite lrb s rrb from vtsandco i now recommend your service and we ll bring all our vehicles to your garage from now on you won me over again great job stars
first off one thing if you ask for more tzaziki sauce they are happy to give it to you just gotta ask and it has lots more flavor than some other tzaziki i have had now for the review great place the food is very good large portions in the gyros as others have said there are many pasta dishes on the menu that sound really good i will update when i try them ted the owner is a super friendly happy guy the place is right nexy door to the fedex kind of hidden away but search and you will be happy you did
if only every dairy farm in the world could be as wonderful clean and humane as the super farm as soon as we pulled up i knew this was a different kind of dairy farm the grounds were exceptionally clean for a farm and it smelled but not in that omg this is so offensive i need a gas mask type of way we actually came here twice the first time was on a monday because we were under the assumption that they were open and they were nt i tweeted my disappointment and was immediately offered an apology along with a free tour i was really impressed with the intense desire to please everyone that they clearly have here we came back later in the week but we did pay for our tour i do nt mind supporting wonderful places like this with my hard earned dollars the tour lasted about an hour and consisted of a introduction to the farm along with lots of great information about their animals and the way they are taken care of next we visited the petting zoo type animals goats donkey horse goose rabbit lamb the good stuff the animals were all clean and seemed very happy after that we got to go on a hayride around the facilities where we learned what each enclosure was for after the tour we stopped in their cute little boutique that is filled with all sorts of great things from novelties to clothing to yummy sodas and homemade dairy products i was also very impressed with how well our tour guide handled the hordes of children and their pushy parents i was super impressed with super farm and hope that everyone gets a chance to tour sometime
went to have lunch on saturday with a few friends we had a nice table on the patio the food was amazing lovely wine and the service was exceptional will be back very soon
ok guys lrb and gals too rrb i know size is nt everything but omg this place has crazy size portions and i loooove it we ordered the calamari and the stuffed mushrooms lrb  orders rrb and still the servings were huge six big stuffed mushrooms sitting on what seemed to me to be the biggest plate i have ever seen serving an appetizer they were great and tasty but cooled down too quickly and who can do anything about that  the calamari was decent could have been spiced up a bit or served with something more than marinara sauce but for those who do nt like a lot of fan fare with their food this would be perfect  classic calamari with classic sauce we loved the stella artois draft beer and martinis came out big and filled to the brim just how i like them for our entrees we ordered the baked ziti and sausage and the rigatoni d both of them were absolutely fantastic yumm and both were huge the baked ziti stayed warm right up until we packed the rest to take home because they actually bake it right in the ceramic type dish that they serve it in very smart for those with little ones the kids menu is awesome and probably the healthiest meal a kid is going to get anywhere nothing at this place is pre packaged or pre made and that goes for the kids meals as well their chicken fingers are home made lrb the pickiest of adults would eat these things rrb no french fries  home made mashed potatoes and broccoli florets this is the kids menu our waiter needed to be coaxed out of his shell but he was still warm in that great way that the good ones know how to do without intruding great leather booths linen napkins white table cloths with a white and red checkered one thrown on top for added warmth elegant but not stuffy guys could go in with tshirts and dress shorts and fit right in and for the ladies who like to dress up you can as well with out feeling overly so i am definitely going here again what a find
after reviewing yelp comments my husband  i visited last week we had an amazing dining experience service was excellent cocktails yummy and food delicious we had lamb shank babyback ribs lrb both were fall off the bone rrb and sides green chile mac  cheese was amazing and the roasted asparagus was cooked perfectly ca nt wait to revisit next spring training
their rum bar has now been open a while and flights are available i was never a rum aficionado  too many rum n cokes when i was too young to care about such things  and have now discovered a whole new world the food has become nothing short of spectacular the ambiance  from the inside i can pretend i m in the west village circa by greenwich and horatio does nt get any better than that
once again yelpers you rock my hubby and i were out visiting and was looking for an easy sushi place this came up on our radar and on a whim decided to go at first look this place is in a strip mall hmmmm not exactly what i expected concrete floors worn tables and plastic chairs but the bar  nice and inviting ahhhh we pulled up a chair to the bar and settled in yelpers told us to say hi to mo so we asked and lo and behold mo is the owner who was asking what we would like we asked for his recommendation  the yellowtail fish and i was in the mood for a salad kicked off with the seaweed salad if a seaweed salad can knock your socks off this one did just the right amount of dressing incredibly clean and cool tasting i knew we were in for the night while we ate we talked to mo who is actually from toyama japan and has had his own sushi bar for some time he spoke broken english but that does nt get in the w  ay of his great sense of humor and welcoming manner and before i know it we start talking to the person next to us who is none other than the concierge for the boulders and this is one of his favorite places to eat talk about an endorsement mo sliced the fresh fish right before us with unbelievable ease and skill yellowtail practically melted in my mouth the tuna nigiri completed the night we absolutely love sushi but i have to say this is the freshest and most authentic japanese food i have found and being authentic is what mo is all about no fancy decor just the freshest wellprepared sushi you will ever have so do nt go expecting some lavish dining experience if you like california rolls stay home want ridiculous americanized sauces  skip this place but if you know good sushi you will never want to leave this place just writing about toyama has me jonesing for it once again i guess i ll have to wait until we re back in that neck of the woods wah
delicious sandwich prepared fast and just the way i wanted it i ll be back for sure welcome to the neighborhood

went here to celebrate my birthday with some of my hot babe friends which happened to be cinco de mayo rachel was our bartenderserver she is very friendly and helpful we asked for her recommendations as to what was popular and good there was seven of us so we had an opportunity to try quite a few items on the menu we ordered the fried sausage ravioli the coconut chicken tenders the chicken lettuce wraps tempura vegetable medley and the chef s sliders all from the appetizer menu we also tried the mac n cheese with bacon and the pork chop dinner she makes a great french martini i must admit i did nt like the margarita i guess it s cause i do nt like it with ice and i like more salt on the rim but probably my fault since i did nt tell her i did nt want it on ice everything was fabulous but if you re going to order anything absolutely a must is the mac n cheese with the bacon the bacon really adds to it and the pork dinner had the right amount of gravy i do nt know if i could even call it gravy but we were practically licking the plates of the mac n cheese and the pork i really liked the ravioli and the sliders since i m not all that big on fried food all i can say is that they were good for fried food but it would nt be something i personally would order but that s me just like i would nt order lamb but we wo nt go there i d absolutely return rebar is across the patio and is the bar we dropped in there to see what it looked like

first motorcycle means the excitement and agony of buying all new gear the excitement is getting all this new gear and picking out stuff that suits you or your alterego the agony part is that i never imagined that there was sooo much to choose from not only are there an array of manufacturers but a lot of different styles designs and colors within each this leads to bewilderment but thanks to a couple of moto buddies i picked out the right gear for me helmet harbor is the place i bought it from and here s why they get five stars rrb excellent customer service they re small so they ca nt always answer the phone but they ll call back within hours and apologize for not getting back sooner they ll stay on the phone and offer advice and suggestions about gear rrb no tax and no shipping charges i had to buy a lot so saving a few bucks was sweet rrb quick service i placed an order on wednesday and had it by friday just in time for the weekend rrb easy returns i ordered the wrong size in something and had to send it back they posted the credit to my visa the same day they received it helmet harbor will be my go to shop for gear from here on out
this is the best library in the valley and one of my favorite places to study the interior design water fall glass elevators and many other features make this the perfect metropolitan library for our downtown the top level is pretty quiet and has beautiful views of the city quick tip it seems that the southern part of the building is hotter because of the sun so i always sit on the north part of the building
i was shopping one day at aveda in chandler mall and was discussing hair products etc with the staff when they informed me of this place i had no idea that a gym would also offer a full service salon and day spa much to my surprise lifespa is an aveda concept salonspa meaning that they solely use aveda products in all of their beauty treatments if you are familiar with aveda then you know they are a company based on using pure flower and plant essences i booked my hair appointment with hesitation since i had a bad hair experience in the past that always makes me gun shy to try something new when i arrived i was greeted with a hot cup of the aveda tea i love their tea and look forward to it every time i come here or visit the store in the mall i found the interior to be more organic and natural feeling than i expected lrb since it s located inside the lifetime fitness gym rrb i was introduced to monique lrb my stylist rrb and she actually took the time to do a true consultation about my hair what i wanted what i had in the past short term goals long term goals color texture and on and on i wanted to put color in my hair and she and i discussed lowlights and highlights i was very impressed by the amount of time she put into figuring out my hair and what would look best when i started going here in winter of my hair could barely tuck behind my ears and now i have hair that is a few inches below my shoulders monique made the hair growing experience less painful than it had to be she always trimmed and styled my hair according to the stage of growth since i have moved to the central phx area but still make the drive out to gilbert to see her because she is amazing and i have complete trust in her abilities if you are in the area please check them out i have not tried any spa treatments there lrb mainly due to the amount of money i spend on the hair rrb i do get low and high lights so the bill usually comes in around ish but i feel it s worth it since i only get my hair treated once every months fyi you do nt have to be a member of the gym to use the salonday spa

i have never stayed here but when i lived in scottsdale i spent a lot of saturday nights here talk about tranquil beautiful relaxing i ve had drinks i ve sung karaoke i ve listened to some great music i ve taken gondola rides and been serenaded only in italian by the gondolier s operatically trained voices i ve eaten dinner at their wonderful restaurant i ve sat outdoors with the paradiselike vegetation i ve walked by their sandy beach area and the wading pool i just love this place maybe someday i ll even stay here
on behalf of all those practicing catholics in search of cuisine options for meatless fridays during lent i thank you wildfish for making it pretty darn easy it s long overdue but i finally paid a visit to wildfish last night in the height of spring training madness and the thousands of additional desert guests presiding over our restaurants i was happily pleased when i found out that wildfish takes reservations it was about pm when i called and they had one time available  pm sold so at pm sharp we made our way to wildfish it was jam packed and lively with locals and tourists all enjoying some of the freshest seafood around this place is called wildfish so you d expect wild fish to be served right  well you re in luck because they stay true to their name the server informed us that they pick out the fish fresh off the docks and fly it in fresh on a daily basis nothing is frozen and everything is wild lrb not farm raised rrb the menu has pretty much every item in seafood format you can imagine everything from lobster tacos to crab stuffed shrimp the menu is so detailed and everything sounds so good it was actually really hard to make a decision but i went with the lobster bisque to start and had lobster tacos for my entree we then ordered asparagus and seafood rice for the table to share the second we sat down they brought out thick and fresh bread and the type of bread you expect when you go to a seafood restaurant they kept the drinks freshly refilled the lobster bisque came out in a hot metal kettle and when they placed the bowl in front of us it was at that moment that they poured it in this is an impressive way to serve bisque because it keeps it from getting cold from the time it goes from the kitchen to the table the lobster tacos were delicious and there was a good amount of lobster in there the tacos came with corn pico de gallo and fresh avocados with a tasty sauce included the asparagus was a fresh veggie addition and the rice added the perfect twist to the meal as i sat there enjoying my fresh fish i almost felt like an ocean was just outside our doors lrb wishful thinking  i know rrb before i go i must mention dessert each dessert takes minutes to prepare and we could nt say no so we opted for the chocolate souffle delicious delectable devilish that s all so now that i have had the chance to finally try the seafood restaurant in my backyard i come to the conclusion that you can in fact get quality and delicious seafood in the desert  and in a great atmosphere too
my friend and i stumbled into red bird as we reluctantly joined a group of coworkers to our local bertos taco shop i guess my initial short review is that his place has substance over form the lady behind the counter was extremely nice and she convinced us that they had the best burger in town for background we ve seen four different burger joints come to our neighborhood claim they had the best burger in town only to pack up and move on months later one of them was run by an indian guy  i thought cows were sacred anyway we took her up on the challenge and ordered the burgers and i have say in the immortal words of samuel l jackson lrb jules winnfield rrb that is a tasty burger good quality meat nice bread and the amazing part fresh condiments anyone in az knows that tomatoes suck here but for some reason my slice was excellent a rare treat in this arid environment also the fries were really well done so as our buddies at bertos strolled over and saw how good our food was we agreed to come back soon because the best feature about this place lrb in my opinion rrb is that they ll serve you anything on the breakfast menu for lunch so if you want a nice clean unassuming place to get a quick relatively inexpensive breakfast or lunch this is your place
i have eaten at big wa twice now  love it i do nt normally eat a lot of chinese food but from now on i will be eating it at big wa the portions are a great size for the price  the price is right my kids were even happy with their food they did a great job accommodating our large party as well great job big wa

went back to the same trail last weekend i still love this place for hikes it is close to home not crowded clean and just a nice trail brought my cousin along and he liked the hike too  rrb
let me point out first and foremost i am impressed by the consistency at yard house each time i dine there no matter the location i can always count on delicious food and great service with such a large menu it really is a wonder that they can get it right every time and i was feeling particularly hungry after an arctic coyoteshawks game truffle fries  heaven in my mouth topped with parmesan cheese and chopped parsley this snack item was definitely worth the calories regular fries will never live up to their full potential again on the appetizer menu the coconut shrimp is a winner four very generously sized butterfly shrimp are battered and fried to perfection atop a bed of shaved carrots papayas and cilantro give me a second while i wipe the drool off my keyboard please mac and cheese squared is a personal and house favorite for good reason cheesy noodles cooked in truffle oil with wild mushrooms applewood bacon and chicken breast definitely a staple menu item the burgers are great happy hour menu is awesome in forward and reverse and did i mention that the selection of draught beer wraps around the bar  thanks for being consistently awesome yard house
i ve always liked delux burger but i loved zen i am so so so glad they started serving the zen sushi at delux i ve never been more excited about anything i ve already been a few times and it s just as good no it s better try the sweet potato fries with the aioli sauce one of the best items on the menu also the haagen dazs shakes are yummy as well
amazing and delicious food paired with great wines and friendly service love it
love this place met up with a good friend for happy hour here i actually enjoy coming here by myself from time to time and people watch from the bar there s always somethin on their wine list to accommodate love their pizzas and salads a restaurant that knows how to tease me properly with nutella as an ingredient will always receive high praise from me decor and setting is perfect for friends and family  if wear permits and is ideal i highly recommend dining out on their patio ca nt say anything negative about this place
wow costco has self checkout now at least this one does love it
went here yesterday with the family to celebrate a birthday and it was amazing this is my second time to city hall and we will definitely be back the service is outstanding and they do a great job accommodating and helping you make your way around the menu etc we started with cocktails and our server recommended a drink not listed on the menu  a cherry lemon drop it was delicious and the presentation was great too it comes out similar to the seafood tower and is so cold the drink bubbles when they put it in the glass very cool we got the seafood tower where they will give you almost any number you like for each option which is certainly helpful when you have a table of people who ca nt decide for the meal we got a variety of their steaks ribeye porterhouse kc strip and all were perfectly cooked and seasoned absolutely delicious our family is in the meat business and my dad said it was one of the best steaks he had ever had we shared the lobster mashed potatoes lrb amazing rrb and some mushrooms all in all it was a great place to have a celebration
i keep meaning to ask if they do gift registries at this store because my friends say i m hard to buy for and i just do nt get it go to made apply blindfold spin stop walk forward buy what you touch unless it s baby clothes it s that easy i really love this place i make people go here i got a rockin ring here some cool books of course a few magnets recent purchase was a baby tshirt lrb for friend rrb that said angel on the front and had a pic of wings on the back aw and the selection is often changing as artists create new things you should go you need to go just go
donna does a great job the spray tan is always even great color and lasts for a week she manages the place very well i am always taken in for my appt on time arizona airbrush prices are the best in old town
pretzels and fondue yes if you re planning on going here trust the yelpers and get these they were uhhhmazing i would have just eaten them as my entree but i figured something more well balanced would be a better route so i got the fried chicken ha this also seems to be a fav among the yelpers and i can see why for bucks you get a huge portion of chicken im talking monster pieces of chicken a hefty scoop of mashed potatoes and two biscuits not to mention a tasty honey drizzle over the chicken which i wish there was more of my boyfriend had the korean style ribeye which he was not as impressed with as i was with my chicken i m not sure what it was that he disliked about it i was too involved with my food to pay attention to his we had the apple monkey bread with vanilla ice cream for dessert and ohh my god it was so good just the smell alone would had sufficed as dessert service was good our drinks were always full and we were never looking around wondering where our server had gone next time were up in scottsdale we ll be coming here
the sunday brunch is amazing their food is great however very spicy if there are any wussies reading this at night the restaurant tends to get packed so be prepared for a little wait during happy hour they sometimes give out free food
great food great happy hour unique place i will definitely be returning for many happy hours to come rrb i had the shrimp toast the escargot and the clam chowder yum yum and yummmm the clam chowder reminded me of fresh clam chowder from the pier in sf
i m in love bacon you have my heart and my stomach after all  where else does everything come with one of my favorite foods attached to it  even my bloody mary had a slice of crisp bacon in it along with a celery spear olives and onions probably one of the best bloody mary s i have had in awhile the location is a little off the beaten path which is why i think people are lined up to get in the breakfast club a couple of blocks away for mediocre food and here at bacon  the food and service is better and there was no line on the sunday i was there i was seated in what they call the nook located on the side where i had full view of the restaurant the menu was well organized and entrees come with toast and breakfast potatoes and your choice of a side of bacon or ham you can also substitute fresh tomatoes if that is your wish the food came up quickly and was delicious my ham and cheese omelet was perfectly done lrb all melted cheese and ham inside and firm eggs on the outside rrb and the side of bacon was crisp and tasty given the size this easily was a egg omelet breakfast with drinks ran about which was cheap for all the food i got but i would be remiss if i did nt talk about what really blew me away about this place it s the fantastic service everyone seems to be part of a larger team i was greeted by one person seated by another and had at least three servers taking care of me and countless people stopped by to ask how things were if i needed more water for my tea or if i wanted more preserves for my toast it was unbelievable while they have been open for months  they had the staff of a place that has been open much longer the ambiance is contemporary but is warmed up by the blue booths checkered table cloths and some mismatched dining tables in the center that can be expanded for larger groups there are also antique food cases lining the walls filled with tins of chocolate and other food cues i also liked that they have those roll up doors on the one side that bring the outdoors in and seats outside on those perfect days if i lived in scottsdale  this would be my go to brunch place what i do nt get is why people are waiting in line at a place around the corner that left me a little cold cmon people if you have nt checked bacon out  you should after all  what s not to like about bacon 
this place is by far way superior for their bun bo hue than anywhere in the usa i have traveled all over the world lrb including little saigon in westminister rrb and this place is still by far the best lrb i have eaten at thousands of restaurants all over the world rrb ca nt say the same for their pho lrb da vang and phu thanh has better pho in my opinion in phx rrb it has been over there for years now and it has endured the test of time no one that i know have complained about the quality of food there that i know of and i know asian clients are the most difficult to please lightening fast service no matter how busy they are
my husband and i went to the golden corral on power rd in mesa we thought the food was excellent for the price the service is hard to bet and the staff is very friendly they have many dishes to choose from so you will have no problem finding special dishes that you like serveral deserts to choose from including ice cream soft or hard if you do nt mind getting up and getting your own food i am sure you will enjoy the resturant on power rd in mesa
favorite hole in the wall for burgers and fries never had a bad meal there perhaps a little pricey but worth it to me anyway
i have nothing but wonderful things to say about kale s every person that i spoke with on the phone or in person was friendly and helpful i had my brand new lrb week old rrb car keyed by some unfriendly person they scheduled me right away and it took much less than they originally planned the best part they even were able to give me a loaner car while they had my car they worked directly with my insurance it was a very painless and simple process i highly recommend kale s to anyone that needs auto body work done
i love this place the burgers are amazing the fries are just as great and i get to snack on peanuts while i m waiting for my food also the ingredients are all natural

what can i say  this is awesome i am a donut fan and would give dunkin stars just like this place great variety great coffee fresh donuts the extra star comes for the fluffiness of their dough its very fluffy and its done just right dunkin is good but its donuts will taste a little hard and old when they have been sitting for a while for some reason the bosa donuts dun get too hard even after u buy and drive for like  hour home i know its not located in the best part of town but they are open hrs and there is a drive thru they accept credit cards and discover rrb

that s right  stars i do nt care if i am star happy i loved this place hubby and i stopped in after doing some grocery shopping we were surprised it was open on a sunday as it looked like a little mom and pop shop that would nt be so already props for being open we are always leery of over sellers when we go into places like this we had been furniture shopping all weekend and we had had enough of being tailed through stores the ownerworker  was very pleasant she greeted us and then went back to what she was doing lrb we like that rrb we were free to wander poke pick etc without so much as a peep from her the shoe area was well organized and we felt comfortable looking the women s clothes were very eclectic wellpriced and fun to look through i mentioned that we should bring his teenage daughter there as her style is a bit more funky and hippyish it is a bit crowded but i am claustrophobic lrb really rrb and i was fine as we made our way out lrb without purchasing anything rrb we thanked her and said we d be back she said did you get one of our flyers for second saturdays  pleasant as could be good job we chatted briefly about second saturdays lrb definitely look into this  this weekend will be the first one rrb and we went on our way no guilt for not buying anyway i am sure we will be back when we do nt have pork cooking itself in the car loved it
as long as i ve lived in arizona since i ve had the pleasure of knowing about this hidden gem fiorella s ristorante is a hidden italian restaurant in the back corner of the fry s food store shopping center on the south east corner of th avenue and happy valley road i ve been there many times and ca nt seem to ever find anything wrong with the place except that not enough people eat there authentic italian food fast exceedingly wellmade and not too pricey they accommodate holidays and make your experience worthwhile the majority of the time the owner fiorella is in there working harder than anybody else in there it has a real italian restaurant feel with a small town restaurant experience since it is such a little known restaurant their food is nothing but awesome also great for romantic dates took my girlfriend there and she s begging me to take her back there

ok ok as a proud italian i hope my momma do nt see this i m actually going to give dmoes a star rating for a few reasons last friday me and my brothers left the suns game and proceed to put a few adult beverages back at around am when haney s shut down we had an overwhelming craving for crap pizza lrb its better than our normal jack in box at am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing rrb low and behold the only spot that was still taking orders lrb up to am rrb was dmoes now st off  i live at summitt lrb by bob rrb these guys gladly delivered to me all the way down there major props for that  they understood me considering i do nt remember ordering the pizza lrb i woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad and me saying who ordered pizza then i burped wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo  apparently after checking my voice mail the driver was pounding on our door for about minutes lrb we were really jamming out to rock band in case you do nt know were pretty awesome wikipedia that ish ladies and gent s  kansas city bullriders rrb well the driver and my door man both called times i m assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out maybe he had a slice with us  who really knows these things however i do know that i was insanely impressed with dmoes from the left overs i ate the next when i could remember it was pretty darn good between the awesome  ness that is called their customer service and the legit taste it left in my mouth i m a believer unless if i say i m not will i get a commercial  hmmmm potential there
excellent dinner excellent service had the piccino filet cooked to perfection service was very friendly and professional she knew how to strike up a conversation and make you feel good little hint  do nt eat too much of the great bread  you ll ruin your appetite
the food is so fresh and you have sooo many options to customize your own bowl if you do nt like it its your own fault since you made it lol so much food for your buck and it can be pretty healthy if you use the fresh veggies and you dont pack your bowl with all noodles hot tip add a few shrimp for my bf loves it since he is into the whole caveman thing and likes triple meat and they dont have a meat limit or charge extra for it restaurant is always very clean would recommend to everyone that whole shopping area is kind of dying out but this is its best kept secret hopefully yc s is here to stay
i was in urgent need of haircut and i just did nt feel like risking a bad cut at great clips i was browsing through groupon and voila i see a great deal offered by hair by alyse so i m pretty trusting when it comes to strangers cutting my hair lrb yet i wo nt go to great clips  i know does nt really make sense rrb so i decided to give alyse a try the verdict  she s awesome she really knew what she was doing the sign of a good haircut to me is when i just pretty much zone out and do nt feel as though i m sitting on pins and needles watching the stylist s every move alyse was easy to talk to and worked effortlessly yet seemed very focused all the while props to fitting me in on short notice  i had to wait for about minutes past my appointment time but i really do nt mind as long as there s a current magazine lying around oh once inside the beauty plaza it s a little tricky to find her if you ve never been in before   alyse s business is also called studio but it s not located inside suite  lrb as i found out when i walked into  rrb she is actually in the first suite you see straight ahead as you walk in another tip  she does nt currently accept credit or debit cards make sure you bring some cash
now that i m living back in central phx i got a membership once again at movies on central i love their selection and i can usually find that odd arty flick here that most other video stores do nt carry just like this weekend i was searching for ladies and gentleman introducing the fabulous stains starring a teenage diane lane and movies on central had it i like how they have a cult movie section and section off movies by director if you are a movie buff this store is for you

this was my neighborhood restaurant i ve eaten here more than i care to remember their pollo fundito is permanently a part of my hips unfortunately i love sitting in their back room near the little waterfall but the big room is fun too  from watching folks teenage couples to families managing too many little ones and of course being able to hear the karaoke in the bar their food is sonoran so do nt go looking for anything else they have some of the best fajitas in the valley bar none even if they do call them carnitas picante de la luna see omar s review of another location for proof it s my girlfriend s favorite chicken chimi in the valley too very phoenix traditional i put that in quotes because you have to know what you want this is nt my place to go for mexico city food it s not my place for coastal mexican food but for traditional phoenix mexican food it s at the top of the list
i m a huge  rideordie phoenix mercury fan has been plagued with countless injuries but the heart of this team never waivers neither do i not every year is gonna be stellar but through the good times and the bad i will be a merc fan count on it
i love this patio it s lit well warmed when it s too cold and just has a great circular energy last night we were here and a large group of obviously totally plastered men and women stumbled off this enormous camper that had just rolled up to the entrance that was weird overall an easy place to spot skinny jeans or your philosophy professor at asu good burgers kiltlifter do nt forget to ask for the beer on special they give good deals on good beers oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah the bathroom is really really nice for a regular run of the mill bar
you should only venture to lolo s if you are looking to eat the best fried chicken ever seriously i though i though i had died and gone to heaven the waffles were also enjoyable as were the grits and mac and cheese but oh man you ve got to try this chicken my friends and i went on a tuesday night around and walked right in
no matter what you re craving pita jungle can not only fulfill it but it wo nt make you feel like crap after you eat it i ve eaten here once and the ambiance is really great it s usually crowded but not too loud everyone that works here are incredibly friendly as well most of the time i just get togo orders they have salads that are todie for lately i ve been eating paleo so food choices are limited if not impossible when i m going out to eat not here they have something for everyone no matter your diet lrb glutenfree vegetarian paleo etc rrb to sum it up you ca nt go wrong with the jungle
my husband and i were really excited to try cowboy ciao after all the rave reviews we d seen on yelp and were definitely not disappointed  at least not by the food and drinks the fact that we were less than impressed with the atmosphere lrb really dark decor kind of reminded me of black angus rrb and staff lrb our server was overly enthusiastic when presenting the specials but not around when you needed more water or the check rrb is nt enough to make me take away a star or two because the food and drinks were delicious and wellprepared enough to make the experience a great one despite these drawbacks i got the movie star martini and my husband got some version of the manhattan lrb ca nt remember the name rrb  both drinks tasted like wellthoughtout concoctions and were definitely worth the  lrb which is something i can not say for many overpriced restaurant cocktails rrb we started with the ohsofamous chopped and it was heavenly we actually did nt like the buffalo carpaccio as much as we hoped we would  while the meat itself was tender and fresh the chef had overseasoned it and the espresso and cumin flavors were overpowering for our entrees we had the pork chop stuffed with blue cheese and bread pudding and the short ribs with cherry bbq sauce we were both impressed that the server asked if we were ok with having the pork slightly undercooked  this preparation is really the most flavorful but many people remain uncomfortable with undercooked pork because of the trichinosis incidents of many years ago having it prepared this way made it so tender and the meat s flavor was complemented by the bread pudding figsraisins and flavorful sauce that accompanied it the beef short ribs were also deliciously tender and came with a hearty but so rich serving of pecan grits my favorite part was definitely the tangy barbecue sauce with whole cherries in it overall this was a great lrb although expensive rrb meal and i am sure that we will return to cowboy ciao lrb maybe with guests from out of town rrb although the slightlypretentious decor service and concept will probably prevent us from making this a more frequent destination
great neighborhood sports bar great nightlife food and vibe
nypd ranks up as one of my favorite pizza places in the valley their pizza and calzones are absolutely amazing  incredibly fresh ingredients all with their own unique twist lrb their italian sausage is to die for rrb the pizza is very traditional new york style  very thin crust the focus is more on the ingridents what impresses me the most however is the prices are superb you can get a pizza for about with two toppings amazing price for under we had two sodas an appetizer and a pizza that easily fed both of us lrb without the appetizer rrb highly highly recommended
holla atcha baba ganoush omfg love this place i had nt been before one of the soldiers i work with said she wanted some hummus  chicken hummus  says i i shall venture out to retrieve this prize for you if you will man my station for the duration of my investigation of this location anyway i went out to grab lunch for my coworkers in the lab as the reigning queen of indecision i decided to get the mediterranean combo best decision of my life well maybe weekend but still the baba ganoush is my new fave thing the hummus was awesome they gave me a whole pack o pitas a pack they did nt even take them out of the bag holla and i know this sounds weird but the croquette things tasted like burritos i used to buy for like a buck and microwave might sound gross but in reality i would eat those burritos everyday if they were nt disgustingly bad for me so bonus i got hummus for another soldier he loved it i heard that the gyro was to die for and the hummuschicken combo was delicious gotta get it with the limecilantro hummus plus i got all this for less than bucks you ll see me here again in a tshirt that says baba ganoush is my homie 
dear switch thank you from the bottom of my heart for hosting a crowd of rowdy drunken and often shouting yelpers to your oh so generous weekend brunches i hope to make this a weekly ritual wherein i pay my respects to the patron god of the aztecs and their sacred drink the bloody mary  poured into a massive carafe garnished with celery and made from the fresh innocent virgin blood of pubescent spanish girls on behalf of my yelp crew and im gonna go ahead and say all of the phoenix yelp community thank you you make sundaysaturday mornings a happy blurry drunk driving fun day that i cherish
grandma are you back in that kitchen  get out of there that s basically how i always describe this place its grandma breakfast you know fresh cooked to order and way too much i have always loved matts and have been coming for many years the only thing i hate the wait lrb well that and the unfinished sloppy paint job in the dining room rrb the food is always great here their pork products are amazing super fresh cagefee chicken eggs local produce and hearty thickly sliced breads served with a side of strawberry lavender preserves yummy if you re not in a hurry and have the time to endure the wait this place is highly recommended although my grandma left me many years ago her breakfast spirit lives here
absolutely delectable my husband and i absolutely love postino so when we saw that the owners were opening new concepts windsor and churn we were pretty excited we live about a mile away so we have been driving by just waiting for opening day we went for ice cream at churn tonight and are planning on checking out windsor soon the decor inside churn is super cute think old soda fountain decor there are approx different flavors which they make daily they also have coffee and lots of yummy pastries cookies etc i got a scoop of butter pecan with a red velvet cookie the cookie was pretty good and the ice cream was amazing it was so smooth and creamy my hubby got one scoop of the peanut butter and another of the double chocolate he enjoyed both there is nt inside seating but the weather is so amazing right now that the patio was just perfect the parking is a little screwy a few spots where you can self park but mostly valet i felt kinda silly using valet to get ice cream the staff was super friendly and helpful too we will certainly be returning and would highly recommend churn

my favorite place to enjoy an excellent wine or beer selection is my wine cellar on the north side of warner rd between i and th st whether i m looking for a private tete a tete table a perch up at the lively bar or a couch around the fire table out on the patio the staff will go out of their way to accommodate my wishes new owner zoya never misses an opportunity to express what s new on the wine list or menu lrb which is updated seasonally rrb to pique my interest chef sarah is a genius in the kitchen please do yourself a favor and order her belgian fries  perfection cheesy welsh rarebit was better than mom made sorry mom at the most recent wine paring dinner chef sarah and zora did a fabulous job of flawlessly matching the wines to the fixed menu true art blends line form texture and color together now add flavor and true art is what chef sarah served delicious hors doeuvres salad scallops osso bucco and a delectable chocolate caramel dessert conversation was lively service was seamless clearly the entire staff was committed to making the evening very special for its diners that s what makes this wine bar better than any other i ve been to in recent years  attention to detail great wine food and the company
best bagels in az by far being from nj i thought id never have a good bagel or pizza again when i moved to az now if i can only find a good pizza place these bagels are a lot better and a lot cheaper than the garbage einstein bagels across the street at desert ridge
if heaven exists what do i want to hear god say as i arrive at the pearly gates  and we re catered by the parlor have been there only five times now lrb or is five a lot  rrb it s literally a mile from home which makes the parlor really too accessible friday and saturday nights are a tad busy for us regulars lrb probably not a regular by any means but most reviews seem to come after the initial visit whereas we have returned again and again and again so there i m calling us regulars rrb the true and final crescendo of all our parlor experiences came last week when my mom who was visiting from michigan mentioned she wanted to take us out for dinner first the back story originally she was talking steak but as our entourage included a yearold durant s just did nt seem like the best idea i had seen children at the parlor on every other visit and verified on the website that there was indeed a bambinos menu pb  j at the parlor  sold why should parents be relegated and alienated to only the restaurants that have playgrounds arcades or where any and all food is given some sort of completely illfitting adjective lrb how happy is this meal really  what exactly makes a fry zany  rrb with news of pbj and leapster in hand the child was attended to and satisfied back to that crescendo my fiancee who is italian ordered the smokey i the puttanesca and my mom the pappardelle bolognese of course we all have to try eachother s right  upon trying the bolognese my fiancee the italian raised by an italian mother in an italian kitchen said this is the closest to my mom s that i ve ever had in a restaurant please queue the halleluia chorus so yes this is as good as it gets maybe only two other authentic pizza places in the greater phoenicia even bear mentioning beyond the parlor trust me people i m dealing with the offspring of the year old female equivalent of mario batali easy to cook for is not a descriptor of this man i love my one only minor teeny weensy complaint bring back the original zeppole although our dear waiter assured us the addition of the orange inside each zeppole and the change from chocolate to salted caramel dipping sauce was an improvement i d have to disagree can we get them sans orange 
this is a real find and i mean find because it is tucked away on the side streets of downtown glendale this small little restaurant is unique in decor and cuisine not many polish restaurants around the food is flavorful and fresh the soups are unique and tasty the stuffed bell peppers are awesome as is the stew the owners are warm and inviting without being overbearing my only disappointment is the limited hours i work too far away to get there for lunch and they are only open a few nights a week definitely worth the trip
i love this place it s on my short list of places to make sure to take visitors i always get the bruschetta and there are so many different options to choose from it never gets old one of favorites in the valley
i have worked with several employment agencies in the past but renaissance personnel group is the best i have ever seen on so many levels i met with my recruiter but also was introduced to several other members of the staff including the founderpresident the best thing is that they use a team approach to helping you find a job  they are committed to working together to find the best job for you everyone i met was wonderful professional and truly engaged in the process i left my interview feeling so optimistic about the future i am truly looking forward to working with this amazing group
eaten here for years best sushi ever fair prices and very nice people
my muscles were out a wack and needed a massage where did i go  one of the brand new massage envys this one is in the new norterra shopping center clean and nice staff seems to be able to be friendly and helpful i was very please with my massage and so much so that i joined if you join make sure you get an extra massage for free i did
i moved into a house nearby and immediately added mi patio to my list of restaurants to visit as often as possible the baja chicken burrito owns as does the everyday margarita special
disclaimer i am not a vegetarian vegan or hipster what the hell am i doing at green  eating really friggin tasty food that s what this green location is very airy and pleasant on nice days the garage door in front is opened up so the whole restaurant seems like a patio the staff are friendly and orders come up in a timely manner the parking lot is quite tiny so sometimes it s tough to find a space but it s worth the wait today for lunch i tried the ranchero salad the salad features green s famed wings which i learned today are made from mock beef not mock chicken the restaurant happened to be out of the beef and i was asked if chicken would be okay silly me thought that wings would be made of faux chicken anyway i m not sure what they taste like when made with beef but i really enjoyed the chicken version the salad also has a vegan version of ranch dressing which sort of tasted pestoy to me but was cool and refreshing just like nonvegan ranch but without that heavy arteryclogging feeling yum i ve also had tried the secret bbq chicken sandwich this seems to be quite a popular item but i thought the chicken in this dish was chewy and hard to bite through the sandwich was also messy to eat because it had tons of sauce on it the sauce is fantastic though just get lots of napkins i particularly like the green burger and addictive thyme fries the apricot miso noodle bowl really surprised me lots of sweet and subtle flavors green is an excellent place to come for a late afternoon lunch i think even people who are hardcore carnivores can find something to enjoy here
at long last my lrb seemingly rrb never ending search for the best burger in phx has finally come to a close the wife and i decided to meet here for lunch after noticing this joint a few months ago too bad we did nt try it out earlier the atmosphere is very modern very hip this is the new wave burger joint that is sweeping the nation and their decor can be seen in other local spots such as the parlor or the vig very similar style we showed up right at noon and it was a  minute wait for a table we opted to sit at the full service bar and had very attentive service from our bar maid great menu with plenty of options we had the blt steakhouse burger the sweet and spicy burger and the peppercorn burger between the of us all were cooked to our specification s and all i can say is wow that sweet and spicy burger is fin phenomenal i was so pissed i agreed to share with the wife as i would have preferred to have all that deliciousness myself candied jalapenos  who knew  the meat is very flavorful and has a great grilled essence happening and the toppings put this burger over the top the blt burger was also good but the meat and the smokiness of the bacon really overpowered the toppings not a bad thing as delicious meat and smokey bacon are great but other flavors were lost here the sweetness and the heat from the candied jalapenos really left an impression and the sweet and spicy burger is now my goto burger in phx full bar and pbrs on tap make this a weeknite destination now that i know what i m getting into lrb and i can ride my bike here rrb i plan on making myself a regular at the bar and with that sweet and spicy burger there is no reason to eat a burger anywhere else
in short yummy awesomeness delicious and cheap ca nt go wrong with this place i m somewhat of a sandwich nut i ve driven to beyond bread in tucson just to have a sandwich more than once this is my favorite place in phoenix period i wish they had more of these around like in cali but i do nt mind the drive to chandler the place itself is pretty nice well lit and adequately decorated creating an easy going atmosphere they only take cash which is sometimes very annoying but that s the only thing bad about this place the menu is pretty divers many sandwich items are available most of them are vietnamese style but there are some cross cuisine items as well most authentic and my favorite is probably numbers and but you could nt go wrong with trying a new sandwich every time you go there they have a bakery built in so the bread is amazing always fresh and crunchy if you just want to go pickup a baguette you can all their sandwiches consist of a foot long baguette sliced down the middle sub style then filled with your meats pickled radishes and carrots and then topped off with a little cilantro and jalapenos if you like it less spicy just take the damn jalapenos out they also have amazing drinks decent desserts and pretty yummy appetizers i recommend you try their chicken wings very crispy and delicious but a bit oily the price is what makes this place amazing pretty much all the items are between  the sandwiches are pretty filling as well making it an unbeatable combo you guys should try it out wo nt be disappointed
the manager told me immediately that she was from syracuse ny and asked me if that was a problem  does this person know who she is talking to  in spite of this handicap this little bakery exceeded my standards it is the best breakfast place in the state of arizona that i have visited since the death of my great uncle albert in flagstaff az the croissants breakfast sandwiches macarons and assorted pastries are worldclass is it sf s tartines  perhaps not but it has given me hope that bread in the usa especially washington dc will some day improve the coffee is also outstanding which makes it a star bakery also the manager also told me aside from being from syracuse she did not care at all about syracuse basketball my unspoken message to her was that hoyas were not born yesterday in all seriousness this place is a must visit when in the phoenix metro area
note that the previous reviews were from before the remodel there are bathrooms and adult beverages my kids went here on a saturday morning with their grandpa and had a great time they said everything was very modern and clean at am on saturday morning kids under bowl free you just have to pay for the shoe rental the kids said there were several bowling balls to choose from the owner and the employees working there were very friendly you definitely should come check the new place out
this is my favorite mac location in the world they always have everything i need in stock and the staff members are always super friendly and willing to help out i have shopped here probably ten or twelve times and have had the same positive experience each time i m glad they moved to a bigger store means more products available for me to buy rrb my only dislike is that it is in the biltmore fashion park so parking can be a bitch but if you are going there anyways its the perfect time to stop by and pick up some mac
the best coffee ever i m now addicted to the new java rush
wow the tabbouli salad here was impressive fresh and delicious the gyro meat was thickly sliced ot thinly sliced like most greek places serve the hummus was flavorful and had a kick to it maybe paprika  the pita chips are fried in house they where served hot and greasy my entire dining experience here was amazing and alot cheaper than the other greek place that we frequent free wifi at this place not bad  you will need some serious mouthwash when you re done eating here so i do nt recommend it if you re out on a date  smooch smooch no no
for anyone in tempe and scottsdale this is worth the drive to check out for anyone in chandler this should be a twotime a month stop minimum this has everything you want in an old fashioned breakfast diner middleaged waitresses that smoke and drink a lot of coffee possibly named flo food being cooked out in the open creating a sort of sizzle soundtrack while you wait great bacon and hash browns lrb what the hell else do you need for breakfast  rrb this is my second review where i can accurately describe a star business with a part list for you plane enthusiasts or you boring people who are looking to take your girlfriend to something different  this should be it you will often see acrobatic planes whizzing around as you nom on your hash browns disclaimer i have not taken my girlfriend here yet so i am a hypocrite
trying to figure out what to have for breakfast  not really wanting the the usual hotel fare of sausage scrambled eggs and french toast that s been sitting on a warming table talking with s on the phone this morning and he s on yelp looking for unique places for me to check out that s in close proximity to my hotel he mentions the farm at south mountain  it sounds intriguing so why not  it sounds so much better than what was being offered at the hotel the farm at south mountain is one of phoenix s gems when i first arrived i was nt quite sure what to make of the place i took a walk down the little road towards the back end of the property here you will find an open grassy area with shade trees and rows of picnic tables and space enough for kids to run and stretch out their legs there s also an expansive organic garden with rows of vegetables and flowers which i understand supplies the cafes that are on site with all their fresh produce a little further behind the garden the morning glory cafe serves breakfast the retreat  a place for massages facials reiki and midwife counseling and the cottage  a place for local artists to display and showcase their artwork after i had breakfast at the morning glory cate lrb that s another review rrb i spent some time at the artists studio looking over the work of some very talented artists the lunch spot is the farm kitchen which is located towards the entrance of the complex by the time i walked toward the entrance the farm kitchen was bustling with the lunch crowd i did nt get lunch but from what i could tell everything looked fresh and yummy i stopped in to pick up some fruit some bakery goods and a drink while waiting for the hotel shuttle to come pick me up the farm at south mountain is a great place to find respite from the hustle and bustle of the city  even for a short while
josh is completely correct this is by far my favorite freshmexican type of place and it is by far superior to chipotle i always order the daily special lrb which they have had every day i ve gone  rrb of the salmon tacos with rice and black beans my understanding from over a year ago is that they were nt doing so well with sales so i m overjoyed to hear from josh they are packing it in during lunch hopefully they will still be there when i move back to scottsdale they are nt open every day though as i found out during superbowl weekend so you might want to call first
lucky for me i work close to this place because i am addicted tacos for and they are not small at least in my opinion i had the chicken chorizo and carne asada i thought the chicken and chorizo was amazing spicy but not too spicy you will know that you are alive i had some chips as well they were great and reminded me of the chips from chipotle that i totally love this place was cheap very fast and sooo good om nom nom nom
does it make me less of a man to say that i love frances  vintage hip different i have been to this store many times with my girlfriend they have very little in the way of men s items and what they do have is generally for the more petite men than myself but i could easily shop here for every gift giving occasion for my girlfriend or any of the other women in my life they have far out jewlery and clothes the most attractive item of clothing i have ever seen my girlfriend wear was a dress from here that she tried on and decided she would never wear so did nt purchase it bummer i enjoy looking around it is like a museum set up to display all the things that a woman i date should fancy and wear the prices can be up there but some items are very fair and frankly for the quality and origionality of the items i find them worth the price if you can pay it
the best restaurant truly amazing
kevin has been working with us on our water heater and he is always on time always nice and definitely knows his business i ca nt believe he has nt been reviewed definitely the nicest handyman i have ever met and reasonable in pricing
i ve been procrastinating on this review because i have yet to get to petite maison for anything other than their late night staff meal however i can not wait any longer as i have never had anything but an exceptional experience here having known chef james  wendy from their previous restaurant lrb tapino rrb i expected petite maison to be topnotch but this location is so welcoming and cozy they could go cheap on the late night staff meals and the red cup specials but they do nt  the quality of the flavors are unbelievable i ve had a decadent foie gras mac  cheese poutine with an overthetop fried egg and most recently the most supreme bbq beef piled on polenta each of these dishes were consumed on different occasions and each for just the quality never fails and the staff is always friendly and accommodating they even kept my leftovers warm the other night until i was ready to pack it in  head out lrb without me asking rrb
very nice and friendly staff and reasonably priced there are a many items on the menu and they seem to add new ones often i have eaten in many sushi bars in dc vegas and miami and the atmosphere here is just as good the sushi is good enough that it seems to be what ra sushi wants to be
lee lee s finally expanded from their chandler location for us who have loyally driven an hour to shop low prices huge selection and it only took like a week for the place to smell like a true asian market lrb ie wherever you are you will never escape the smell of fish rrb i love it i bought ingredients for vietnamese spring rolls two different kinds of curries a new motorpestle a vietnamese coffee press and some various other vegetables and liquors hardly anything also the seafood while i did nt purchase any looks very fresh wonderful to see such a great addition to west phoenix
this was our first time at texas bbq house they gave us a sample and help us with our order the brisket was fantastic i got the moist and my wife got the lean we both enjoyed our choices immensely i will definitely go back i wanted some spicy bbq sauce and apparently they have it but i did nt see it
my experience with vincents is a solid nine out of ten every time there duck tamales are incredible and you still can even find vincent himself in the kitchen cooking on many nights nice to see success has nt changed the work ethic for this restaurateur s dream im sure it was a hard road but there are few if any french restaurants in town that offer such splendidly sinful food choices overall i love the old world look the service is usually top knotch and for fine dining the price is no more or less than other similar quality restaurants
excellent service fast professional and very efficient i highly recommend this company to anyone who needs work done prices also very reasonable
i have children and i ve been shopping at urban kidz for years the clothes are fun and unique and i appreciate that they offer lines you ca nt find at nordstroms or some of the other boutiques the owner cares about her customers  both kids and parents i love that as a loyal customer i get previews to sales which are a do nt miss opportunity the pj s make the best gifts and they last forever my friends line up for hand me downs and they ve been through girls the splendid line is great and they carry it for boys too  the fabric is like butter large selection of billabong also and that is a very reasonably priced line i never leave without something because it s a guarantee hit with the kiddos and they like looking different from their peers definitely not old navy
i m surprised this place has nt been review more talk about supporting local business this place is amazing  from the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out smiling at the orgasmic chocolate you just bought everything is made with such love and the shop owner stands  behind their product i love it i hope that more people go to visit because that place is definitely a rare gem in surprise we need a phoenix surprise tempe surprise scottsdale surprise

bobby q s is the best bbq restaurant in the valley better then famous daves better then waldo s in my opinion this used to be bobby mcgee s in the s and they would have live band and dancing there i went there with my wife motherinlaw and daughter we did nt make reservations because we did nt know you had to until we had called them that day at the time they were nt taking anymore reservations until after pm and that was too late for us it was only p at the time the woman on the phone said the wait time was about mins so we went anyways we got there around pm and put our names on the list they said they would call us when the table was ready i kind of missed the little pagers we usually get at cheesecake factory and other restaurants but personal service is still nice too so i waited mins checked the list and there were still groups ahead of us check again at mins and still one group ahead of us the hostess apologized and explained that customer with reservations would get seated first which made sense but i was getting hungry finally mins in we got seated lrb near the kitchen door rrb and was able to order drinks immediately as we looked over the menu they had some specials so i got the prime riblobster tail with sides for i got the mac  cheese and corn i believe i ca nt remember what everyone else got but i know they loved the food they brought out warm corn bread which was moist sweet and great with butter my wife and motherinlaw loved their alcoholic drinks i got lemonade which was excellent as well the meals came after about mins the prime rib simply melted in your mouth it was delicious the mac  cheese was perfect nice and creamy and cheesy just like how i make it my wife tried mine and loved it i tried her bake beans and even those were incredible the corn was also good even the coleslaw that i tasted was very tasty the lobster we juicy and i doused it in the butter for another bite it was cooked perfectly i tried my wife s baby back rib and they were smokey moist and incredible with the bbq sauce i could nt believe how good everything was the waitress came back and forth to our table at least  times during the meal to see if there was anything else we needed very friendly and courteous my daughter who s only yrs loved everything especially the mac  cheese since she loves cheese definitely one of the best bbq meals i ve ever ate i will probably get the brisket or babyback rib the next time i go if you have bbq and steak this is the place to go it was definitely worth the wait and the kitchen door did nt even bother me because i was enjoying the food i forgot a couple things i forgot to mention the appetizers they give you a lot for the appetizers we got the bbq wings and artichokespinach dip and it was fabulous some places will give you  wings for appetizer but we got like twice that amount and it was delicious at the end of the meal they give you soft delicious donuts for free stars from me here
if you have any interest in frank lloyd wright s works you must see this fascinating architectural and historical gem not far from downtown scottsdale take the educational and interesting minute guided tour which includes the interior living quarters where you can sit on the original furniture and imagine yourself transported back in time to the era of flw if you play piano you may even be given the opportunity to play on the original living room piano lrb flw loved pianos rrb others have noted that the outdoor parts of the tour are out in the sun so carry plenty of liquid and if you are heatsensitive come early before it gets hot i would like to return to phoenix just to be able to experience the evening lights tour and if i were local i would come here again and again with any friends who might be in the area taliesin west is very different from falling water in western pennsylvania lrb desert vs rural forest rrb each has its special charms the only thing i did not like was that halfway through the tour the guide offered up petitions for visitors to sign lrb if they wanted to rrb to object to allowing a local developer to tear down another old wright site in phoenix and prevent private development of the land lrb which the developer had paid for rrb land use preference politics should be kept out of the taliesin tour
i think it had been about years since i had set foot in a ymca before i joined this branch last summer i did nt remember much about the last time other than tile  lots and lots of blue tile oh and feeling like i was almost drowning my early swimming experiences were nt pleasant so i was a bit dubious when my sister suggested i join and talked about the place as though it were a palace of some kind hell it s a ymca you know ewww well this location in ahwatukee is not quite a palace but as gyms go it s pretty damn close just working out today i noticed that although the construction materials are just about what you d find in a warehouse the design makes the main gym hall feel like human space that must be hard to do with a gym since so many other designs get it wrong a lot of thought and inspiration went into the architecture here and it shows the heated beachentry pool has totally entranced my little yearold as has the active water sculpturething in the pool which he can activate all by himself just by pushing a button there are not only dressing rooms for each gender set up with direct access to the pool but one set aside for families that one also has its own access to the pool area the machines are uptodate and kept in good repair this location uses the fixlinxx tracking system i ve talked about elsewhere there s a dedicated spinning room and a separate set of the simple grampystyle weight machines lrb at least that s what i call them rrb help is friendly and plentiful and in joining you get a fitness consultation that actually seems to be cluefull the trainers and employees manage to treat people as adults and not as children or draft inductees both hand and bath towels are provided free of charge the childcare area is palatial as well with plenty of toys and places to climb the hours of coverage are ample the girls and women who watch the kids actually act as though they enjoy their work and the atmosphere is a relief in that it s family  lrb and not douchebag  or creepazoid  rrb centered that s not to offend any douchebags or creepazoids out there i m sure there are places for you too in fact i know there are the crowd is neither very young nor very old and no one seems to be intent upon ladderingup to the top of the gym social order about the only drawback to this place is that there are no benches in the locker rooms oh and it can also get quite crowded at prime times though not as badly as the la fitness location i also use it s definitely one of the better values in gyms in the area and that s not even taking into account the opportunities for kid s sports and swim lessons etc
i will never drink another iced coffee unless it comes from royal at the market ever i promise seriously if my hot cup of coffee gets lukewarm i ll be forced to throw it away because then i d be cheating on you and that would be rude and mean i d never hurt your feelings like that i promise
i have taken my pup and kitty to dr kanarish a few times and he and his staff are incredible when i had my pup spayed he called to let me know how she did and called a couple days after the surgery to check on her over this past weekend i took both my pup and kitty there for boarding and they emailed me daily with updates i am not talking about an autogenerated everything is great email the dr emailed me personally giving me details of how they were doing and what they were doing katie even emailed me and described how my kitty was hiding under his pillow and meowing everytime she passed his kennel i have been to other vets before and no one can compare to dr kanarish and the phoenix mountain animal hospital staff you can tell he loves animals and i would nt trust my babies to be in the care of anyone else
here is why i have to give this place stars my husband and i started making delux our date lunch place every tuesday a few months ago lrb see we have two kids and rarely get to eat without the little ones rrb since we go on the same day we ve become familiar with a lot of the wait staff we prefer bobby in most casessuper nice guy working his way towards medical schoolloves to gab and gives excellent service he sees us walk in and comes to our table with two tropical ice teas in hand usually we order the same thingat least husband doesi like to switch it up so after confirming that my husband wants the usual he s off with our order depending on how busy they are we chat with a few of the other servers too since we are frequent visitors we do nt even have to show our vip card anymore do nt count out their turkey burgeri m not a big turkey burger fan as they tend to be dry but this one is always delish the hot dog and chicken panini are also tasty and who can forget the classic standard burger hands down best sweet potato fries on the planet we love delux and their super staff
i have been coming to lux for years ever since i started graduate school here in az what is there to say that has nt already been said other than hands down it is my goto coffee spot in arizona such a warm and diverse group of people rotating artwork the perfect study music playing in the background lrb although it is played a bit loud rrb espresso roasted onsite and baked goods made onsite always find an excuse to end up there for a caf au lait or a velvet if i have a sweet tooth
oh big lots you loveable junk store we all know why we go there  some offbrand cleaning products lawn gnomes a polyblend tablecloth you will only use once or twice so why write a review about big lots because big lots usually looks  smells like monkeys got loose in the store not this store this one is new and rather nice things in their place and still the good pricing you never know what you are going to get in a big lots but this one was a pleasant surprise i will drive out of my way to go to this store i hope they keep it nice i never know when i may need some fabuloso or some other random stuff
great local vegan place try the chicken parm with curry pasta salad
i wish that i could give the melting pot more than stars because they made our company holiday party stress free and absolutely perfect i have put together a number of company parties and they are always stressful and something horrific normally goes on tracy lrb rest manager rrb made the entire process a breeze from start to finish she even let me taste test the wines we were serving that was a fun afternoon   rrb the food was amazing as usual and the service was outstanding i would highly recommend the spinach artichoke cheese fondue and the yin and yang chocolate fondue amazing i would highly recommend the melting pot to anyone looking to host a holiday party or really any type of party for that matter it is also a really intimate and romantic place to take someone on a date
wife and i are a big fan of sakana especially the poke poke and hawaiian white tuna toro staff is friendly service is fast food is great and portions are large
went there again this week and had a great meal and great service this place is definitely a step up from tacos and burritos and it is worth it
wow as said before the chopped salad is amazing and i do nt even like salmonbut the combination is terrific the crab enchiladas were to die for  and my stuffed pork chop good but not amazing portions are huge even the small plates so think share the wine list is over the top and a bit difficult to follow but our waitersom gave us good suggestions and guidance through the maze will go back next visit and be sending friends
we are pleased to be the first reviewers of mia francesca dc ranch has been needing something different and we finally have it this charming italian restaurant owned by a privately held larger company feels like a locally owned restaurant the restaurant is warm and inviting and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable we were immediately greeted by lori the catering manager who was kind and engaging we met our server the tall and statuesque dora and the meal began she knows the menu completely and had recommendations the price points were reasonable  one diner nearby said finally we have a go to restaurant here with the right price point that is nt based around a bar this is a charming restaurant and the food was exceptional i am italian and never would have guessed this is a chain beginning with the wine the price points were reasonable i would suggest a house wine carafe price for a red and a white and watch them sell like crazy wine snobs wo nt buy them but regular people will next came the delectable bread with the housemade extra virgin olive oil infused with fresh herbs divine dora warned us it was addictive and she was right big daddy ordered the spaghetti bolognese as he is a selfprofessed conneisseur and he loved it it was rustic with three different meats  fresh tomatoes  carrots  onions  and other sumptious items cooked for hours we are really picky about bolognese and i intend to order it next week awesome he asked for linguine and it was given they have a whole wheat option lrb big daddy is big on fiber rrb rrb and they only had a penne good choice but they should consider a whole wheat spaghetti or linguine for people who want it our maximillian lrb rrb loved the spaghetti with tomato sauce i tasted it with a cook s palette and it was light perfectly seasoned and good i would order it myself for sure i had the spinach ravioli the ravioli was clearly housemade and the spinach stuffing was delicious the tomato cream sauce and fresh spinach on top were great only needing a few red pepper flakes lrb which i received upon request rrb to balance the dish out dessert was tiramusu and flourless chocolate cake with chocolate peppermint ice cream they were both delicious but the tiramusu won the day finally we met jeff cohen director of operations for the west coast for this organization a lofty title that we are sure is well deserved most importantly to us he seemed like the sole proprietor of a local joint that was the best we came to find out that his daughter goes to our son s school a small world he clearly takes personal pride in opening these restaurants we would sure like to see more of him thank you for a great new restaurant in our neighborhood laurie rodney and maximillian malone
more hookah just so ya ll know they have great food and a cool atmosphere too but the real reason i go is because of the awesome hookahs the hookah service boys lrb can i call them that  rrb keep my hookah going so i can spend an entire night smoking hookah laughing with friends and enjoying the music grab a buddy or two and hit up urban cafe but do nt park in front of the liqor store lrb the owner will be a jerk to ya fyi rrb peace
i am in love with yogurtland fro yo it is super delicious and inexpensive i got the coconut and added shredded coconut and mochi pieces yummm ca nt wait to go back
i can not believe i am giving dos gringos stars but you better believe i am why you ask is this cenpho junkie giving an extremely tempe bar five stars  the one and only fight i have ever been in took place here lrb yes i won rrb i got trashed the other night for you are inside and outside at exactly the same time they have ample bathroom stalls in the women s restroom there are bowls of limes on the counters i hate asking for lime i get hit on at least three times before i finish my first drink they have live music you can get molested in public without being arrested i always get carded
my rave starts here i love everything about switch from the food to the atmosphere the place is simply wonderful i ve only been a few times but i ve enjoyed it each time i usually get the turkey sandwich with cranberries on it lrb the official name escapes my memory rrb i ca nt say much about their happy hour or drinks in general because i have not been since i turned however i will have to make a stop in soon so that i can check that out i love their servers being a waitress myself it is really easy for me to spot servers that are fake and the servers at switch all seem to be genuinely nice people who enjoy their jobs
i ve been a frequent customer of this establishment for years i think we go there at least once a month yes its a chain and their tshirts are hokey but their food is probably some of the best bbq i have eaten my favorite entree is the catfish fingers lrb which they discontinued  boo  rrb there is a selection for any picky eater i m not a big red meat eater so its refreshing to have so many chicken and pork selections the side dishes are probably what seals the deal for me my favorites are the mac and cheese and wilbur beans the only misgivings i have are  rrb the manager needs to stay in the kitchen and not check with every diner how things are going  rrb i try not to eat in the bar area they tend to spend more time doing drink orders since it is the bar all in all it is probably in the top of restaurants that i eat at regularly
pars serves the best chicken kebabs and basmati rice very reasonable prices considering how much food you get
the food is great too many schnitzels to choose from and every one i have had is great try the rouladen if you happen to go when it s a special it is amazing service is good and the portions are too big to eat in one sitting you will be taking some home nice selection of imported german beer so do nt expect to get a domestic brew
went to postinos with our light rail pub crawl group and was highly impressed with the service we received from the staff at postinos it s rare when a restaurant is able to provide seamless service for this large of a group but the staff works well as a team and it shows they got us seated and fed right away all the food was delicious and great for sharing they had a pitcher of hoegaarden special that was too good to pass up i highly reccommend this location as good place for groups
we first went to the avondale location many years ago and the food was great i worked on th street  indian school at the time so the thomas location made sense to stop in for dinner after work we have also dined at the scottsdale location  all three are great the food is always fresh the macaroni salad is great  it comes on a bed of steamed cabbage the chicken katsu is delicious tender  juicy on the inside  crunchy on the outside we also love that the portion sizes are large enough to share with our kids not having to order additional meals love ono  always stop when in the area
i love love love paws salon i used to take my dog to canine preferred but the ladies at the front dest were flakey so i thought i d try a new place and i am so glad i did the owner tracy clearly has a passion for animals walking in you are greeted by a cat dog and macaw that call the front of the shop home you are able to see them grooming the dogs lrb a big plus for me you never know what some places do behind closed doors rrb she is very professional and seems like a no bullshit kind of lady lrb in a good way rrb she s to the point tries to listen to exactly what you want and offers options and suggestions to help they keep track of the previous cut that was given lrb it s annoying some places you to have to tell them every time rrb i would highly recommend this pet salon they also offer daycare and overnight boarding i ca nt want to try the daycare to socialize my pup some more ca nt go wrong at this salon
oh yumminess met a friend for brunch here i love brunch and now when i am in arizona must have some mimi s delicious french toast omelettes stuffed with goodness and fun drinks too our waitress was delightful the whole experience was fun good and belly filling why do nt they have a mimi s on the east coast  good stuff

my one stop prop shop ive been coming to this store since i was a kid i love easley s and their prices dont let the outside fool you inside they are packed to the gills in spooky magical fun creepy and creative stuff my only complaint is they are not open on sundays  sigh 
the paletas are very delicious and they remind me of home in mexico i tried the nuez lrb pecan rrb and the mango with chile both were very good i definitely think is worth checking them out specially when you see a line over people waiting at the tempe store one suggestion have more flavors available

a roadtrip would not be complete without local bbq and bobby s does not disappoint fancy smancy table service dark and cool with bar seating rotisserie chick and bragging about the ribs alex was friendly and rattled off drink specials other servers were chatting with friends at the bar and one blond one dipped into her cleavage for something i hope she washes her hands before serving up a meal now i look around this is a breaking ground for hooters low cut and falling out not a fan of that bobby q amber ale lrb sonoran brewing rrb is too light with a bitter bite not my type of amber but they tried meats brisket  sausage w  mac  cheese and the pecan coleslaw  what the heck for pulled pork sandwich meat with pork and brisket ranch house salad corn bread lrb pucks rrb of sweet warm goodness sides were great the beans with zest the mc takes me back to old school cafeteria the potato salad was fantastic and the slaw was great with the pecan brisket was the clear winner from the table and we all loved the smoky sausage the pulled pork was a disappointing third as it was dry good thing i went with brisket two thumbs up here kids well worth your time and money yelp check in brought a  off the total tab too
it s all about the food and the prices are great i get a  lrb chicken taco tostada cheese enchilada rice and beans rrb and a beverage for just over there is no ambiance unless you count nonambiance as ambiance you ll be eating out of a styrofoam tray and plastic utensils while sitting in an echoing room at tables that after the perpetual daily lunch or supper rush may or may not be clean so how can this get stars  lrb i had to round up rrb it really is all about the food and there is free wifi so you can dine and surf rrb
i came here because i got a fully stamped loyalty card from my gf who liked the good egg but wanted me to try it out for myself so i went alone on a sunday morning around  sat at the bar area the atmosphere was great the restaurant was full of people which led me to believe that it was a awesome place lrb i love packed establishments more than empty ones rrb i did nt have to wait to be seated at all i had to take a considerable amount of time looking at the menu because i had nt the slightest clue what i wanted or craved finally i ordered something that was not exactly on the menu but it still had the basis of what i wanted i wanted a skillet with country potatoes scrambled eggs bacon ham  cheese that s it nothing else the waitress yvette was so helpful she created my order on the ticket anyway  the way i like it she said i can order the skillet however i want it wow no one says that anymore most restaurants always tell me if its not on the menu then they ca nt make it rubbish of course they can they re just being lazy  do nt feel like asking the cooks to make something nonstandard but not the good egg these guys will please you now just do nt go asking for an egg with a filet mignon on the side because that would just be dumb my requests are always within reason or within the bounds of good sense or practicality i opted for the choice of english muffin as an included side i almost always drink apple juice if i m eating a breakfast meal whether it be at home or out i did nt want to overdo it on my bill so i stayed with the refreshing water they have i do nt know if it s filtered but it tasted like it was also i wanted a side item like a slice of french toast but she said it would have been or higher for one slice i told it her it must be huge she said yeah they are normally pretty big she told me if i just wanted something smaller i could get one pancake for a buck of course i took the one pancake because that s all i needed so i got my food in a good amount of time  was marveled by the sight of my skillet it looked so good it was a decent temperature the eggs were cooked to order in my style lrb hard scrambled rrb the potatoes were seasoned just right the bacon  ham was scattered all over  all mixed in with melted cheese i ate well that day the english muffin was nice with the gourmet strawberry jam that was there for me to grab the pancake was not small it was huge for a buck  whoa it was buttery  of course i plastered it with syrup it was a nice touch on the side of my lovely skillet i could nt even finish everything the skillet has a lot of food in it like i said before yvette was sweet  gave me everything i needed when it came time to pay i handed my free voucher to lisa the front greeterseater who sat me she looked it over  saw what i had for breakfast  decided it would all be covered under the free meal voucher so nice of her i mean i did nt order much but still that was nice of her to include the pancake as well i love this chick already  rrb so my sunday turned out to have a real good start to it i had a nice chat with the nice woman at the front counter selena about how i never do this type of thing which is go to a full service breakfast restaurant  eat well  alone to top it all off i mean i used to go to the hop  the den all the time but that was because other people always dragged me to those places by force now this here is a place you would not have to drag me to all in all the staff is on top of it everyone working here is friendly unlike the rest of arizona or phoenix or wherever this general meanness originates from people in this state are always angry at something or i think the heat is getting to them nope not at the good egg this is good old texas style hospitality the employees at good egg do nt act like you are bothering them but instead like you are a pleasure to have as a guest of honor thank you good egg there was no way i was going to let this one go by without being mentioned on this website yelpers read carefully this is good the name suits them well
dr lee is truly talented went in for teeth were knocked out had to have root canals and crowns all the work was painless and dr lee puts the patient first always i ll never see another dentist
had what they call minor knee surgery torn meniscus in three places and went to therapy here for weeks very pleasant clean atmosphere and the therapists i have been working with nick and jerrod have both been helpful encouraging and supportive its somewhat somber in there i d prefer some motivating rock and roll music over the sound system but that s just me
this place is great best vietnamese food
i ve been to both america s tacos restaurants  one on th avenue and one on th street near my workplace the food was excellent on both occasions perhaps a little pricey but then again i like good food and i will not lie no other brother can deny oops sorry rrb anyway go here and you will not be disappointed great outdoor patio seating and good food the combo ca nt be beat
if you do nt at least like this place something is just straight up wrong with you where to begin on the list of delights pecorino tagliatellei think this might be my favorite ladies if you are in need of that pasta fix that plagues us often this is your dish heaven in a bowl make your own pizzawho could ask for more  and instead of making it insanely expensive to create exactly what you want they start the base price at a reasonable place pepperoni  ricottaspeaking of make your own pizza try this combo you will not be disappointed seasonal specialsthere are always daily specials this winter there was a duck pasta dish that made me weak in the knees two sizes of pasta  want to split a pizza with someone and have just a taste of pasta then get the smaller portion just want a big bowl o pasta order the large this is brilliance in my opinion servicehas always been friendly and attentive atmospherelove there s not a bad seat in the house my one and only small complaint they only take reservations for parties of or more that s right a lot of times six or eight of us want to go but to wait for tables together is just silliness

what a neat little place we went around lunch time but they serve the breakfast until  i was a little bummed they did not serve their famous pizza until starting at oh well a reason to come back i had what was called the commuter sandwich  whatever kind of meat you want eggs tomatoes on their home made english muffin wow is all i can say  soft and melt in your mouth not what you would think from a english muffin i also had a blueberry muffin  it was without a doubt the best i have ever had i wish this place was a little closer because i would be here all the time it was neat too because i also saw ryan sandburg lrb chicago cubbies legend rrb eating here i did nt get my stalk on and ask for an autograph but it still was cool to see him there i grew up watching him lol anyway  ca nt wait to go back to this place
although i have nt officially been a paying customer yet i am still giving this place stars my wife and i were walking around the scottsdale quarter and ran into this new establishment it is basically the make your own pottery place as you wish pumped up on some serious steroids you can make your own soap candles birthday cakes and of course pottery they are in a wonderful space unlike the typically tight quarters of as you wish the girl up front was very bubbly and helpful and promptly took us on a tour here s the kicker they will soon be able to serve wine and beer could nt imagine a young kids birthday without buzzed chaperons tons of neat stuff for young and old alike i ll be back
really good gelato our third visit we try to come here when we visit san tan village numerous flavors some of which change seasonally lrb no orange tonight rrb others are pretty stable lrb eg the dark chocolate and limoncello rrb the flavors are strong but not overpowering and very nice i ended up with limoncello reminds me of firenze lrb italy rrb they probably need to me more mindful of how they pack the cups because sometimes there are voids but if you show them they make it right tonight the void was small so i ignored it last time is was large and they gave me a whole new one lrb that had no voids rrb they may also be introducing a frequent visitor or loyalty card of some sort based on what the owner was saying to me i m sure i ll get to make good use of that

say hello to the ghost lounge folks this is a brand new bar located right next to seamus within the san carlos through an agreement with the hotel s ownership for years i ve thought the hotel san carlos was an underappreciated lrb through its own fault rrb downtown venue with the ghost the owner has finally executed a plan to revive its rightful place on the downtown phoenix scene this is apparent from the first step inside the lobby which appears as it did in when the hotel first opened if celebrities in the s had to spend the night in phoenix back then a small unairconditioned cowboy town with around they would have stayed here lrb or else the nearby westward ho rrb you get a taste of those times with the massive photographic blowups the ghost has put up on its walls of various scenes from early th century downtown phoenix so large that you can zero in on individual pedestrians on the streets and marvel at their bowties cowboy hats handkerchiefs and facial expressions back then the san carlos was probably one of the only places in town that was aircooled lrb that may have meant it had swamp coolers i have nt googled the history of air conditioning technology for this review rrb i d describe the bar s style as grandiose and classic old school phoenix with an obligatory hint of chicago lrb obligatory given the decadesold economic relationship betweeen the two cities that endures to this day rrb it has been beautifully done i will be back often
it has been about a year since our last visit and we had definitely been looking forward to it while we enjoyed our last stay the room we stayed in was showing its age and use to be expected though for a hotel that seems to be pretty popular actually when we left last time we noticed new carpet stacked in the hall and the room had a survey asking customers about changes they would like to see in the rooms well it looks like they took those suggestions to heart our room looked freshened up and updated the carpet was new and the bathrooms seem to be remodeled a bit to include soap and hair product dispensers nothing too drastic but nice updates staff is always great and have never failed to grant a request whether it is more pool towels or coffee pods hoping to stay at least two moe times this summer at our favorite phx hotel

when i first moved downtown a few years ago i d regularly drive by and glance with curiosity at this decrepit old building on van buren one day i heard it had gone through some renovations so my ghetto curiosity got the better of me and i made my way past a couple of bums standing around to walk inside i could nt believe my eyes the beautiful stained cement flooring grabbed my attention right off the bat i asked the staff for a tour of the facility and i was instantly sold goodbye la fitness hello ymca it s nice running into my downtown neighbors here now and then since asu moved downtown the crowd has also transformed into a nice mix of young and old everyone from college students to cranky old federal judges
i called miguel at am with an ac problem and spoke with him briefly he told me unfortunately they would nt be able to make it until pm the same day but would call me when they were en route at pm they called and asked if they could come early by pm he and his son had diagnosed the problem picked up the replacement motor and installed it they could nt have been prompter more responsive or friendlier pricing was very fair and they basically could not have done an overall better job of course i hope not to see them again because no one like having ac problems but i would highly recommend them

i give the donkey a star my first the donkey holds a special place in my heart many many good eats and plenty of great beers had here if you like beer  you must try the bad donkey p where the p stands for premium seriously its a belgian white  and having been to belgium this is a damn fine beer if you are squeamish ask for a sample  they ll gladly give you a small glass to test the waters i ve yet to see anyone say no after a sip the service is great and the food is always super fresh and good lord is it tasty i stick to my crusty old italian with pepper jack most of the time but there are so many good subs salads and pizzas here its hard to pick a bad eat super healthy to super meatycheezy  the donk has you covered the owner charles and his wife julie are often found behind the counter at the donkey  not only some of the nicest folks i ve ever met but they are freaking hilarious i ve probably spit at least a dozen mouthfuls of beer whilst eating at the donkey when these two are around due to shear intense laughter i love a place that not only combines great food spectacular cold beer but good times also  if you went in the early days and could nt get a seat  they have expanded the seating area and added a bellyup bar lrb wine and beer only rrb and even a ice cream shop ask charlies for a  boothie lrb donkey p and orange sherbet sounds weird but holy hell its amazing and has alcohol yes rrb you wo nt be let down by the donkey
if you need new tires or existing ones fixed go here all the staff are amazingly friendly courteous and helpful while having locking lug nuts that i did not have the key for replaced lrb at a very reasonable price rrb my car died and would not start they tried to jump it for me and that did not work the mechanic i called could not do anything until the next day and trevor allowed me to leave the car in his parking lot while i went to work he and another employee both offered to push the car into the garage at closing time to keep it safe but since i had to go to work and was hoping it would start at pm i declined their kind offers it did nt but i felt relieved to know that it being there overnight would not be a problem it did start in the morning and i was very grateful that i did not have to deal with tow trucks etc prior to going to work i work in a group home for developmentally delayed adults and we always bring the company van here as it seems to be a magnet for nails once the low tire symbol was on but they could not find a problem so they replaced the sensor problem solved their service is outstanding they provide cold bottled water for their customers when i asked them about buying a tire gauge as the one in the company van had disappeared they gave me a free one because i had a couple of the guys from the group home they gave each of them one too not everyone treats these guys with respect and courtesy so i always make not of places that do and give them any return business once again thank you to trevor and the whole crew you guys are outstanding
great staff without an attitude lrb which is rare in scottsdale rrb as i was waiting for my party to arrive i was sitting outside drinking my beer and eating my food without any questions andor hassle my bill was transferred inside when my party arrived not only that but our waiter remember exactly what i had and was able to split it without me even asking him to do so ok how great is that  i am totally sold on the service there an i will definitely come back very nice unpretentious place

this is a stars in its category not stars among all restaurants it s categories are cheap very casual cafes gourmet but not haute cuisine mexican lrb eg not your local grimy tacqueria but not your overpriced fusion place either rrb here is what i had the quantity alone testifies to its excellence asterisks after the stuff that really blew me away  elote callejeroe   guac  chorizo  tacos cochinita carne asada  lrb rrb veggie  lrb wow rrb  postre de chocolate   the tecate and lime drink
hot damn this place is good it s a beautiful location relaxed yet small interior and an amazing place to dine outside when the weather cools off servers are always knowledgable and friendly and the food oh the food everything is to die for especially the foie gras mussels and the veal cheeks go you wo nt be disappointed
clean and friendly and has a good selection of stuff it s a grocery store so um not much else to ask for
so much better than subway or the other pretenders a inch sandwich for is awesome and more than enough food and not just a bread filler locally owned i met the guy today at lunch and actually told him about yelp so he ll be checking his reviews out but he was really nice as were the guys taking orders and making the food this place gets busy at lunch as the business people around know where to eat when it s good i ve heard a few of my cop buddies say how good it is too and they weed out all the bad places pretty quick anyways the sandwiches are really good and all the meat cheeses and all the fixin s are really fresh and always plentiful on your sandwich and look for the bobby it s like your whole thanksgiving dinner exploding in your mouth turkey stuffing and cranberry sauce i m serious it s so good enjoy guys it s really good food for a great price
fry s rules i love going to this place so much so that i wo nt even set foot in a best buy the first thing that hits you is the size of the store it s like a costco for electronics  the place is huge most of their items are very competitively priced but it depends on what you buy and when their computer and peripherals section is very well stocked they have a good selection and price range for tv s appliances movies and electronic gadgets as well if you re looking for a good camera you might be disappointed it s mostly low end box cameras that they carry good selection of computer books the staff like at most electronic stores is pretty spotty it s mostly young kids that do nt know much and get paid less than they know there are some exceptions though there is one guy in the electronics department lrb big guy wears glasses supervisor i think rrb who is extremely knowledgeable this guy really knows his stuff the people on the returns desk are all very nice one of the things i like most about fry s is their very liberal return policies it s easy and hassle free to return just about anything give it a try  it s heaven on earth for geeks  rrb
i was looking for something a little different to celebrate a coming out party of sorts for my shiny new gf i have always been curious about binkley s and now had the perfect excuse to go  so is a foodie ho lee crap i do nt really know that much about food except that when the good stuff hits my mouth my whole body wants to throw a party for it chef binkley constantly outdid himself with most of our courses i am not going to to give you the bite by bite but i would feel remiss as a budding yelper if i did nt point out a few of the tastiest moments btw  we went with the course taster and wine pairing while most of the food all night was at best fing fantastic it was at its worst still interesting however the winnerwinner was not in fact the chicken dinner rather the risotto somewhat deconstructed super tasty and it had these little pieces of candied bacon that takes the greatest food group to a whole new level second place was my perfectly cooked fish rounding out the podium was the carmelcorn dessert where the carmel presented must know the bacon s stylist the rest was literally a blur of deliciousness to say that my date looked stunning was an understatement but what happened to her about s of the way through the meal was both hilarious and grounds for a michelin star she slipped into a grinning food coma that literally alarmed the staff and probably our fellow diners i swear the sommolier asked twice if she was ok and was met by a somewhat garbled mix of words to the effect of food heaven uhhghh risot oohh yes i am great not tipsy  just physically rattled by the barrage of yummy food i have to wrap this up because i must get back to the job that allowed this oh dollar meal lrb worth every penny rrb possible
these burgers pack a wallop seriously they are big fresh succulent juicy tender and melt in your mouth with the different textures of the toppings lrb depending on what you get rrb all perfectly complementing the meat ca nt say enough about this place while there s something to be said about the bun lrb can get a little soggy on the bottom rrb this is definitely the best burger joint in the valley get it mediumrare for the full tender experience and an order of five guyslike fries lrb same lightness to it but is crispier and fresher rrb plus a sierra nevada you wo nt regret it i do find myself occasionaly feeling a twang of guilt looking at the big happy cow in the field of greens on the back wall but that instantly subsides after taking a bite out of a burger

talk about a beyond incredible experience with the most unbelievable service i do nt know if i m the only one that feels this way but i m just so sick of spending money on the same mundane restaurants that can be found on nearly every corner  ones that run more like corporations than friendly neighborhood cafes i am on a mission to find new places that are as unique as they are delicious and bingo crudo proved to be that place my boyfriend and i tried it a couple of weeks ago on a weekday when it was pouring rain outside so lucky us we had the already tiny place all to ourselves our server lrb her name was liz rrb was so friendly and knowledgable and took her time with explaining the menu to us thoroughly not only did she rock but the chefs were just as incredible in fact the owner cullen lrb i hope that s how you spell it rrb hung out with us and told us all about how he can make items that are nt even on the menu as long as he has the ingredients but i do nt know why you would want to because his creations are so wellthought out and inspiring so onto the meals my boyfriend got the butterfish which was phenomenal and anyone that has tried it will attest to this and i decided to be brave and try something raw for the first time i had one of the tunas and unfortunately was nt completely in love lrb not because of the dish but because i m so picky rrb anyway it did nt go to waste and boyfriend enjoyed it enough to eat that dish too he did say he preferred the butterfish though in case you were wondering anyway i went with something more safe the veal i would go back there every day to eat that seriously it was incredible it also takes a little longer to cook so the chefs made us a little something special lrb on the house rrb while we were waiting did i mention how awesome everyone is that works there  onto the dessert bacon cookie i do nt want to give it away and would rather you just be intrigued enough to go there and have one yourself just know that it was so so yummy all in all it was a wonderful night and we stayed and talked to the staff for nearly another hour after we ate but do nt take my word for it lrb or do rrb either way try this place for yourself

wow i really had thought i d already found the best burger in the valley then what happens  i find myself out in the biltmore area to study and  bam  there s delux can i resist trying it  no no i can not right when you walk in i was struck by the  cool factor they have going on dark paneling and blue accents as well as an awesome long blue table in the middle it s not a big place and i can see it would be easy for it to feel really cramped in there luckily the lunch crowd had dwindled and my friend and i had enough space sweet potato fries  done i was wildly amused that they came in a little shopping cart they are also served with side of ketchup and some some of vaguelycajun rmoulade they are awesome and then my burger came out i really think i heard a choir sing they win huge points for presentation here the colors they use to accent their burger are truly masterful it helps that the burger tastes awesome too and truth be told we went back that evening after the coffee shop gave us the boot for a poststudying drink we got to sit at the big blue table and enjoyed some of the many many beers they have on tap it s a great place for a meal or a drink now if only they had a quiet little corner i could put all my books out on

we met chona who is the owner of the restaurant the food brings back memories back to angeles city where we have an abundance of grill joints that sell grilled pork bellies and chicken her special sauce makes her grilled food really tasty

lucky strike this place is deliciously classy i took my sweety there for our first date it was a sunday just after the george lopez dream out loud tour at the comerica theatre and as soon as we walked in we were in awe its dark sexy and a lot going on there were about a dozen bowling lanes pool tables and a nice lounge area so you can sit watch your date bowl we arrived just before a company gathering had arrived and we were mistaken as being part of the group so they were very happy to see us come in and gave us the royal treatment when they finally realized we were not part of the party they asked politely to ask us to move because it was rented nicole was very nice to us and did nt charge due to the fact that it was a mix up and i did nt understand that it was rented for another party all in all it was a great experience we had a fun time even though it was cut short and i will definitely be back to play and order and try out the food ive noticed people complain about the price of bowling honestly it s a fair price because it includes the ambiance as well and the music and good vibe this place gets the atmosphere of an environment is very classy and those are the types of places id like to continue taking my date and or a group of people that id like to impress so stars for great service great time and nice decor and its in the downtown phoenix scene theres so much to do there and now theres bowling nice nicole provided awesome customer service great job
fresh bagel sandwiches are the best coda b was obviously still under the influence when he wrote his review because there is no arizona classic here all breakfast sandwiches are less than and come with heaping portions of eggs and meatcheese of your choice lunch is also served anytime with mounds of turkey ham bacon or my favorite the nosh french dip roast beef fresh brewed tea is fantastic you are always greeted with a smile you are treated like family when you walk in thanks for all the great bagels
we ve been going to guedo s for over years it s not your fancy schmancy dining experience and they do nt serve microwave food if you want to taste fresh tender garlicy marinated grilled steak or pork tacos on fresh corn tortillas with homemade pico di gallo this is the place if you want reconstituted beans and ground beef go somewhere else food is always consistent servers are always friendly love the place man
seriously this is the best place in arizona for breakfast you ca nt beat the great outdoor seating fun little market shopping and the mimosas and bloody marys what makes this place pretty special is that they grow a lot of the veggies right on property
another visit greeeeeeat carne asada tacos torta and that orange cake quesadillas pork and chicken were a great balance of cheese meat and sauce that orange cake though  like i am one of those people that would do things for good carrot cake and the basic format of carrot cake done with oranges cream cheese icing and all was a wonderful flavor surprise gallo blanco looks like a top contender for places to take visitors just a very well rounded place to give visitors a taste of good eats in phoenix and examples of well done and delish mexican cuisine
have nt had a bad meal here yet the salads are large large enough to share or have half and save half for later or lunch the next day my favorite is the thai chicken my husband and son are addicted to the focaccia deluxe sandwich they love the parmesan pesto spread that have on it i bring home a tub of the spread lrb sold sep rrb and a bag of the toasted bread for dipping when i have company the baked goods are also excellent all fresh and baked on premises my favorite is the butterscotch ranger cookie darn should nt have told you now they will be out when i go
just remember this hit or miss this place can be really really great and full of awesome bargains or you can go on a bad week where you find nothing but stainedripped crap however i ve found some of the most awesome worldshaking bargains at this place g star jeans true religion capris coach shoes kate spade purse the lines can be long for the cashier but they move pretty quick the dressing room is mostly community style so wear undies the bargain hunter in me loves this place the claustrophobe part of me hates this place luckily the bargain hunter part of me is stronger rrb
love trader joe s any of them this one is pretty off the beaten path of surprise az but well worth the trek as its not that busy and the customer service is personal the manager stopped and talked to us for a while as he noticed the hpu lrb hawaii pacific university rrb shirt my hubby was wearing and come to find out we had some states in common super nice guy but yeah the products are great cheap and as everyone knows the best thing about trader joe s  awesome buck chuck  rrb pros  prices quality of products selection  seems the staff love working here or they hire very intelligently cons there s no trader joe s in hawaii boooo
ok now that the weather is cool lrb ish rrb i ve had the veggie pho about a half dozen times some days the broth is better lrb more richly flavored rrb than others but its always good the noodles mushrooms and green onions are great as are the fresh bean sprouts jalapeos and basil my not request would be to throw in some cilantro too everything is better with cilantro all in all i still live this place love it a little more for take out than dine in due to spotty service but the food is awesome
i love this store before finding it i had visited several asian markets in arizona trying to find one particular item they have it here i ll love them forever for having it in stock every time i go super friendly establishment i usually feel out of place when i visit stores like this this one is so nice that i dont get that feeling wonderful i hope they get tons of business
first let me say i like to get my cigars and go home i m typically not one to hang out at a cigar shop i have a mancave in the garage that i dig more but if i did want to hang out in a cigar shop to smoke it would be here great atmosphere and good people the thing i like best about casa fuma is the cigar selection and the fact that the ownersemployees know their smokes i always get great new recommendations from them i always find what i m looking for the other thing i love is their hours i have kids and by the time they go to bed all the cigar stores are closed lrb when i m craving that last minute cigar rrb casa fuma is open until during the week and midnight on weekends how awesome is that great place nice workers it is my cigar shop of choice
i went to timo for the first time last week for happy hour i will definitely be back the service was excellent amy the bartender was extremely attentive and gave great suggestions the spinach pesto pizza with sun dried tomatoes and carmelized onions was off the charts it is an intimate lounge type setting not too loud great music and i can not wait for the weather to cool off because the patio looks so comfortable and cozy with a few tables for nestled in the trees truly romantic
i love teharu i constantly compare this restaurant to the uber expensive sushi places and it not only holds its own but in many cases lrb like the vegas roll rrb it blows places like ra out of the water the best part is its  the price of other places word of caution is the lunch and dinner rushes are nuts so go at an odd time like 
adicted to their ceviche and sales bar with all you can eat chips
i ran across this on my way to starbucks and was delightfully pleased the crepes are just amazing  the best i ve had since living in france the service was great and i would recommend this shop to everyone
yc s  because when i first moved to the phoenix area i discovered the most beautiful mexicanamerican woman in the world working at yc s mongolian stir fry in fact having sampled several locations in the valley the owner seems to be fond of hiring the most beautiful mexicanamerican women i do nt really care but it is distracting when i eat there twice a day if you ve never tried mongolian stir fry basically you put raw ingredients into a bowl add sauces and it is cooked on a big hot surface after a couple of minutes bing lunch and dinner and another lunch if you know how to play the system at yc s there are no going back for seconds so plan accordingly you get your bowl and pay lrb children are charged by age or just get them a small bowl rrb your first step is loading in the meat huhhuh the meats are sliced and frozen place a good amount in the bowl and press it down with the papers at the end of the bar i like to then go to the fry station and load some peanuts in the bowl and put on some hot chili oil then i load on assorted vegetables tofu and noodles then i add the sauces some locations have sauce experts who take a brutal ribbing for having that on the back of their shirts imagine a beautiful mexicanamerican woman with that on her shirt it gives you ideas impure ideas honestly the line method is meat veggies sauce then step up to the fry station add sesame seeds peanuts pineapple andor assorted oils and such and the chef will cook it for you i do it by jumping around lrb when there s no line of people behind me rrb so the sauce sits on the meat lrb huhhuh rrb and is nt all sitting on the noodles do nt worry about overloading the bowl a mile high of your food choices it cooks down and the idea is taking stuff home they actually encourage it lrb take out boxes are cents so it s a profit scam deal rrb add a bowl of allyoucaneatandstuffintothebaggiesinyourpocket rice lrb white or brown rrb and soups lrb always two kinds rrb and you are in heaven with beautiful mexicanamerican sauce experts huhhuh please do nt forget to tip the cook a dollar per bowl and leave a couple of bucks for the girls who have to clean up the table scrubbing and bending cleaning up after such a dirty dirty boy mmmmmmah
unreal  just go especially if you are a tourist i never in my life realized just how many types of cacti there were until i went here and the educational aspects of the desert botanical garden are myriad without being preachy yes it is hot but shade is available and drinking fountains abound
love their boba and especially their diamond ice that fills with fruit such as strawberries melons and my very favorite red beans always order the medium ones cause you will crave for more if you order small guaranteed rrb
i have been with dr pospisil for about years i love everyone that works in this office and i would never go anywhere else i have had routine checkups fillings and now crowns i have found dr pospisil to be knowledgable in new dental techniques does very thorough work and is careful and gentle administering shots and during lengthy procedures he has been great at including me in the treatment plans so i understand what and why we are doing the work i am very grateful to shir re for her efforts in working with me as i changed jobs and insurance companies several times in the past years and always explaining billings yolvi janice and wanda are wonderful and i look forward to seeing everyone in the office at each of my visits
loved it my favorite item was the grilled corn i have been craving it ever sense
a most unique and delicious menu combination but even more impressive is the wine the wine selection is one of the best in scottsdale between expert guidance warm service and an intriguing melody of flavors it turned into a memorable evening and it was a great value do nt stop
very good soul food i had the soul plate with friend chicken okra and cheese grits it was all insane the drumsticks are huge nice and crispy i would definitely check it out if you want soul food
my  favorite must restaurant in phx ca nt go wrong with the elixirs or the tuscan kale dr weil knows how make u feel full in a good way
the fresh mj breads and tammie coe cakespastries are the best on the west coast the communter sandwich is my favorite breakfast food the to go salads are fresh and more than you can eat it is a very popular place so be prepared to wait in line but it is worth it
this place can be a bit deceiving when you are parking or even when you see the restaurant parking can be a pain but once you are inside it s clean and roomy the waitress is very polite she seems excited to see someone coming into the place and she s been this way all times that i have gone here now to the food our first visit here i had the cevapi the sausages are really juicy tender and delicious but the bread the bread it s soft slightly chewy airy but not dry the bread alone is worth coming back for friends of ours had ordered the pita filled with cheese and black bean soup the soup was very well balanced and really flavorful the pita is a must have i ve had the meat filled pita but for myself i prefer the cheese filled pita if you come here and you like coffee you have to get the turkish coffee it s you do nt get a lot of it mind you but what you do get is very strong smooth and good to boot the last time i went here there were of us and we ordered the meat platter it s not on the menu and it s expensive but you get tons of meat the tray of meat comes with nice size pieces of their amazing bread as well needless to say the tray for fed all of us plus friends who ate the leftovers at my place later that night so buyers beware it s really a ton of meat on it came chicken steak different sausages and different meat patties by far my favorite sausage was the veal sausage it looks like a kielbasa but it is nothing like it they sear the veal sausage so its casing has a bit of a crunch it s sweet and very very flavorful one of my favorite sausages all in all you get really good customer service a lot of food at a cheap price cool atmosphere ca nt go wrong with cafe sarajevo i have recommended and will continue to recommend cafe sarajevo to my friends
yummy
i drive by this place every morning on the way to work its a very cool place to stop even with cars in front of me i do nt feel like i waited in line like i did at a starbucks drivethru because once you pull up to the window there are always super happy baristas happy to take your order and talk to you while they make it i walked up once and saw that their coolers had dutch bro stickers on them and since i always talk about this place i asked how much they were they trew a box full of stickers in front of me and told me to pick out what i wanted so now i promote  oh and for sure get the punchcard for free drinks and sign up for the emailtext list because they always have specials
i m sure not a lot more can be said that has nt been already in previous reviews but i just had to add my two cents and say this place is wonderful and i m glad i got back to the chandler area on a visit so i could have the fortunate experience of eating here lrb i learned about it on yelp in san diego rrb i was introduced to pasties on my trip to michigan last november and had them a few times there and i will tell you the one i had here was way better than any i had there perfect crust perfect mixture inside  i just wish i lived near or that they would open a branch in san diego area i got the lamb and mint pastie and it had a mild but distinct lamb flavor lrb sometimes i order lamb dishes that just taste like beef so i appreciated this rrb mixed with the veggies and mint very delicious i would have loved to try a dessert but i was too full and had no frig in my motel to take leftovers back to the waiters and waitresses were all very friendly too i will definitely add this to my list of mustgo places for the next visit
stayed there for the first time while visiting for work i was pleasantly surprised to find all the amenities and style of an expensive hotel at such a competitive price i highly recommend it while there i had a unique situation that the entire staff helped resolve the professionalism was superb mr metgzer and mr watkins went above the call of duty to make sure i was happy they alone were reason to return it was my first time staying at aloft in tempe i look forward to coming back often
my girlfriend i love love love this place excellent food beers and wine to enjoy on premises friendly helpful and funny staff a wonderful grocery to shop from and an amazing selection of cheese and wine it s a total foodie destination this place is fantastic ahwahtukee lrb and phoenix in general rrb needs more quality driven food and wine centric places like this
always something special from the buddah kitchen we ve never been disappointed get the orange chicken
great staff and never disappointing i have a hard time going here and not getting the stetson salad interesting food combinations that definitely please the taste buds
i drove by the coach house tuesday morning at am on my way to pick up my car from old town lrb another story rrb and there were people sitting outside boozing like college kids on saturday night this is the scene every day as many rd shifters come to tip a few back after work while the rest of us are walkofshaming it home god bless this weird place i once saw a year old man plow his harley into the side of the white picket fence that seperates ch from the rest of society and almost lost a leg me not him i dont think he would have felt it if he had lost his leg anyway it was great it was also still light out super strong drinks from hans on the patio and a bill worthy of small town northern michigan lrb read cheap as hell rrb this scottsdale dive as another reviewer wrote is just my cup of tea tacky christmas decor inside digital jukebox huge patio and the kind of peoplewatching that can only be found at ch this indian school and goldwater bar is perfect for any drinking occasion  day night or latenight you can even stop in after you grab your car in the morning  rrb
what s not to like about this place  this is the place to bring the one you love and watch the romance sizzle this is the launching pad to a very special evening the food changes with the seasons the service is attentive and their wine pairings are spot on sitting in the gazebo under the grape vines can not be beat
since the first time we tried the liempo and the lechon we were hooked we are from las vegas and every time we come to arizona we have to go and eat at wholly grill the pork liempo and their lechon lrb on saturdays and sundays rrb are awesome on the nd we took our entire family here to have lunch before we shop for our ingredients at mekong market everybody loved what they ordered my brother in law loves their chicken adobo my husband super loved their chicken bbq and my niece loves the dinuguan that she ordered the rest of the family ordered the liempo like me we also loved ate chona she owns the place and cooks everything she is one sweet lady that takes pride on her cooking we have ordered party trays here and have never been disappointed their food takes a little longer to come out because she cooks them fresh you can not rush perfection  this is coming from a person that loves to cook and takes pride on the food that i make as well last monday we ordered a tray of lechon kawali lrb it would have been lechon but ate chona did not have fresh pork belly anymore rrb for our noche buena another top notch dish from wholly grill it was totally delish the tray went too quick and was disappointed that i would nt have any left over for the lechon paksiw i always recommend wholly grill to all my friends who wants to visit arizona a must try place if you are craving or wants to try good filipino dish you wo nt be sorry we totally love this place i wish we have a place in vegas that is comparable to this
this is a fun little place with an amazingly diverse menu and outofthisworld food the beer list has everything from mickey s to gourmet brews the menu offers small light salad for me and grilled steakfilled sandwiches for my husband it has a fun and easy atmosphere with incredibly nice staff i have only been here a few times but it is becoming a new favorite
i actually really like the divey feel of the marquee yes it is big enough that they can get some really awesome acts yet small enough that it still feels personal honestly the best part of the marquee are the bands that come through top notch
yellow curry was great and pad thai medium is a good heat level we were very impressed small family place with amazing food
when i travel i always try to eat as much native food as i can otherwise what s the point of traveling if you do nt try to experience some of the local culture and cuisine i was therefore excited to find a fine dining restaurant offering local native indian cuisine rather than the ubiquitous tex mex of the southwest well i enjoyed one of the best dining experiences of my life here not just best native indian dining experience the restaurant is located on the wild horse resort complex which is a native indian resort offering casino  golf as well as hotel facilities my only problem was navigating the huge complex and my only criticism was that the signposting to the hotelrestaurant was poor something which i mentioned to the staff and received a promise that the problem had already been identified and was being dealt with just in case it still has nt head for the golf clubhouse and keep going beyond that despite the lack of signage there is valet parking available but self parking is no problem the hotel itself is spacious and kai is located on the ground floor kai is the pima word for seed and there are many obvious native indian influences reflected in many aspects of the design and architecture  this is all explained in the restaurant menu and is obviously an aspect of the experience that they re very rightly proud of here the restaurant has been recently refurbished to a very high standard the tables are well spaced out and everything reeks of top quality  for example the menus are printed on embossed paper i think the way to sum up this amazing restaurant is  attention to detail i ve been lucky to dine in michelin star establishments but nowhere in the whole world i ve visited beats kai for attention to detail everyone knew my name from my reservation cutlery restocked from different sides of the table new napkins for every visit to the restroom crockery and cutlery warmed or chilled to appropriate temperature for every dish the service is also friendly and very informative there is also great drama with the food and choreography to the service foie gras is bruleed at the tableside soups are decanted into bowls from pitchers multiple waiters coordinate simultaneous delivery of dishes to multiple diner tables my server kindly arranged a fresh orange juice then came another moment which sums up this amazing restaurant  i was offered fruit accompaniments with my glass of regular water onto the food i went for the tasting menu with its interesting choice of ingedients and combinations i was pleased to see that the choice of breads included local indian flatbread  a local indian chief came into the kitchen to show the chefs how to make it this was served with a first rate fruity olive oil amuse of buffalo tartare with cornbread crisp crisp microgreens and balsamic vinegar the buffalo was more gamey than normal beef and the balsamic vinegar was an excellent foil avocado panna cota toped with shrimp ceviche the server poured over a papaya and mango soup at the table my first huge smile moment when i found my chilled spoon this was a dish which intrigued me from its unlikely combination of such disparate ingredients and it worked the smooth avocado was a perfect base for the tangy ceviche and the fruit soup was nt too sweet but the subtleties of the papaya and mango were definitely evident flavors for a carnivore i was amazed at the great salad which followed  the menu told me that the lettuces had been picked by local farmers and children of the gila crossing school the salad had a chilli dressing it was accompanied by date cake with foie gras lrb yum rrb humboult fog goat cheese and heirloom tomato with candied walnut baja scallop topped with dried mango and sandalwood dust the sandalwood gave the dish a powerful aromatic introduction which activated all my salivary glands an unusual use of what is usually used in incense sticks the giant sweet scallop was served with bean puree fried salsify and fennel pollen seared foie gras with macerated huckleberry and a fig in filo pastry if you ve read my other reviews you ll know that you ca nt go wrong with seared foie gras with me palate cleanser of guava with fennel sorbet and mango sauce grilled tenderloin of buffalo from the cheyenne river tribe the meat was open and evenly textured tender with a nice gamey flavor the plate was completed with a chorizo and corn cake and a morel mushroom mix lamb with pecan crust with chocolate and chilli sauce chocoalte with chilli has become mainstream and i wonder if this is where it originated cheese belgian soft cheese and a tasmanian cheddar medley of desserts corn creme brulee fig bread with chocolate ice cream inside italian meringue bruleed tableside with fruit also lovely to chat to chef de cuisine jack strong after the meal
if you want your car fixed right with good parts with no upselling of fluff services for a fair price this is your shop
another decent harkins location clean theaters and restrooms fast service with a smile and a thank you
my dog stays here every time we go out of town she seems to really enjoy it and has her own vacation while we are away karen takes very good care of the dogs i feel much better knowing that my dog is not in a kennel i am so glad that we finally found always unleashed
one of our very favorite places to go eat  in the phoenix area and in general i love the ambiance patio is great service is outstanding and the food is always perfect i think i could live on their steaks and creamed corn
i love me some sidbar it is hands down my favorite chill lounge in downtown phoenix the crafty cocktails and small bites are perfect to help unwind after work the music is chill and even on the weekends you can have a conversation because the music is nt blaring so nice on sundays they have retrohi fi and the dj spin some sick beats and bring in some amazing acts shoot i want to go right now
manila sunrise gourmet serves up unpretentious dishes filled with rich and hearty flavors we ventured in here eager to try out this restaurant for lunch and left full and satisfied the owners here were warm and friendly and at the buffet area there were about items for people to choose from in addition to single dishes they offer combo meals lrb items for for each extra item rrb and if there s something on the menu like lechon kawali lrb deep fried pork belly rrb that you do nt see in the buffet chances are they ll be able to make some for you on the spot my friend and i shared a item and item combo we got a good mix of dishes such as fried fish dinuguan lrb stewed pork rrb lechon kawali chicken curry and stewed jackfruit in coconut milk each dish had very good rich flavor and came with a hefty side of rice out of all the dishes i was most impressed with the dinuguan it s basically a stewed pork dish made with pork blood and spices this is my first time trying this dish and despite the sanguine origins it was really tasty i could nt taste any particular blood flavor per se lrb due to the spices and other ingredients to enhance the sauce rrb and the pork in the sauce was nice and tender there are fridges with various drinks like bottled water coke products and some more asian drinks such as calamansi juice and coconut juice as for ambiance it s basically a little holeinthewall momandpop restaurant due to the reasonable prices very friendly service and homemade dishes made with expertise and care this is definitely a place i d like to go to again
i could eat this times a week and never get tired of it the most amazing chicken feta salad ever large portions and they do not hold back on the feta the staff is frendly and amazing the food is great i love this place how could i forget the pita bread mmmmmmmmmm this location is my favorite but is pretty small go early and be patient it is definitely worth it

if going to a super sized store  spending  hours on saturday morning doing your grocery shopping is your thing than this probably is not the place for you but if you have a busy life style you want to run in  out and get something healthy to eat then fresh  easy is the place for you a very friendly staff affordable a great sampling area in the back and exceptional quality lrb produce as well as premade meals rrb they also have the best lemonade in their refrigerated section
this place is great the staff is very friendly and helpful the sandwiches always fresh and tasty
staff is great live music is great other chandler irish bar tries to copy them but ca nt clayton and others behind bar remember what you drink and how you like it they are quick with a joke or to light up your smoke seriously a good bar though
amazing food drinks and service mike was the server pretzel fondue for an app fried chix and pork belly cuban for the meal best fried chix i have ever had five plus stars only thing that would make it better is if it was locally owned
my favorite place in the world to eat great service and awesome food

macaroni and cheese here is just amazing seating inside is limited as is there vodka selection but the food is great
i ve been doing business with foto forum for about months now and i ve always gotten great customer service and advice from the folks there just recently i had an experience that pleasantly surprised me i d purchased a promaster cf card from them in january i used it for a while but then it got corrupted somehow i switched to another brand that i had on hand and took the promaster back to ff they exchanged it for another after verifying that it was a bad card with no problems i stuck the new one in my camera case and forgot about it until a couple weeks ago lrb i may have formatted the new one in my camera i do nt remember at this point rrb i pulled it out to use it for a firmware update and found that neither my camera or computer would recognize it so i took it back to ff they tried to format it in one of their cameras and it would nt function for them either with no questions asked they not only exchanged this cf card for a new one but they also upgraded it to the new extreme cf that promaster makes in other words they exchanged a cf card for a card without any hassle or paperwork that s the kind of customer service i really like one side comment the people behind the counter at ff are photo geeks lrb and i do nt think they d be offended by that rrb who happen to work in a camera shop meaning they re incredibly knowledgable and more than happy to help but maybe not overwhelmingly polished and salesmanlike i ve dealt with all of the gentlemen working there currently and ca nt think of a single negative thing to say about any of them regarding pricing i research everything i buy before i make a purchase i know that i can beat the prices at ff on many items by ordering online the difference is generally fairly small though and i feel that it s worth the extra   to purchase locally and have the access to such an incredible knowledge base that the folks at ff have to offer
love this place i went with my grandma and aunt on a thursday afternoon the weather was great but just a tad windy so we sat inside first i like the layout of this place very open and airy there are outside patios one street level and then one upstairs i actually have been here twice so far first time was just for a mid afternoon cocktail with one of my stylists the servers were very friendly and our concoction of vodka grapefruit and cranberry juice was the perfect blend the second time we ordered small plates to share ahi tacos artichoke and spinach dip and the mussels all three were heavenly and very reasonably priced the ahi was fresh and chilled perfect for a warm day the artichoke dip was different than any i have had before gooey cheesy goodness that we gobbled up practically licking the bowl the chips that accompanied the did were fresh and perfectly salted even when the dip was done we still polished off the chips the mussels were in a perfect white wine sauce but the stars of this dish were the mussels themselves buttery and melt in your mouth good not chewy at all with no grit to most common problem i find the broth was so good i let the bread marinate at the bottom of the bowl soaking up the juice my martini was a generous pour and even though they were out of blue cheese stuff olives the bartender took the time to stuff some and deliver it to our table now on to the staff all are a good looking lot but they are also skilled all of our food and drinks were delivered in a timely manner by our lovely server jennifer we also met one of the sous chefs lennie a charming fellow with stunning blue eyes my grandmother remarked on them a playful mohawk and tattoos peaking out of his uniform he swears that the sweet potato fries are some of the best in town and sent over a complimentary bucket i do believe he is right cooked to perfection slightly crisp on the outside warm and soft on the inside dusted with fresh herbs and i believe parmesan cheese after our meal the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking rnr is another great place within walking distance from my salon and i am looking forward to trying everything on their menu if all the items are as wonderful as the first i tried i am in for a treat
back story i was misdiagnosed by a state healthcare clinic lrb the one on th ave downtown avoid at all costs i only went because it was the only urgent care open so late rrb this first place ignored my suggestion of i m pretty sure i have pneumonia this pain in my chest on breathing matches that and doped me up on a bunch of conflicting pain killers and muscle relaxers that resulted in an overdose from just of them lrb luckily i came out of it without hospitalization thank god i did nt take all rrb i went to doctors express the next day based on the yelp reviews i was seen promptly the doctor an older lady listened to my symptoms actually took a stethoscope to me lrb the other place had nt rrb and said  yep you have a pneumonia in your right lung she was absolutely appalled by the amount and kinds of medication place  had given me  one an antibiotic for an accidentally discovered urinary tract infection was in a high enough dose to damage my kidneys and of the painkillers were known to cause seizures when mixed she took me off those lowered the antibiotic dose and gave me a zpack she was efficient nice a nobs type and i had no more pain in my chest after days of her meds and they have discount cards for your prescriptions i wish i had just gone here first and avoided a week of scarynesspeople who really should not have medical degrees bonus the waiting room is pleasant it s carpet not tile which makes a big difference in not thinking you re at the doctors and smells nice it s the little things rrb
i had the best lunch ever in the history of lunches at da vang today so many nice things have been said about da vang in other reviews so i wo nt repeat the details except that it is good fresh and cheap every time without fail i ve been there often and just realized today that i had nt reviewed it atmosphere  it s a room with some tables no frills but who cares  service is purely functional no chitchat or pleasantries  fine with me bring on the pho or rice stick noodles or stew or drum roll please the rice soup with fish that s menu item b they use lemon grass in it and must put in a pound of lovely perfectly cooked cod it s heavenly and takes a little longer than most items to make so be prepared
loved this hotel the rooms were beautiful and modern and the staff was friendly and helpful they have a really cute restaurant and bar with outdoor seating and a fire pit we sat outside at night and drank wine by the fire it was great ambiance i will definitely be staying here next time i am in the area
 hours after breakfast i m still paralyzed in bed and too lazy to get up and check what those things we bought were not sure what they re called but it s like a candy cane basically a thin stick i think  we bought of those for after our meal it was supposed to be cents each but anyways you get there and there are a bunch of rocking chairs for you to sit on and play a game of giant checkers and you can even buy a rocking chair if you d like you get in and like other reviews it really is like a gift shop and then you walk into the back which is a huge and clean restaurant that has a great atmosphere and seats plenty we immediately got our table for two and i ordered the country fried steak breakfast platter that also came with eggs cooked by my choice biscuits with gravy grit lrb which was sort of plain but i threw some gravy in to try to make it better it was my first time trying grit rrb and hash brown casserole all that for  what the hell i ve never seen a price that great for that much food my brother got something similar and then ordered a side of sausage patties which went perfect with my biscuits i got my order and the first thing i did was make a sausage mcmuffin the country fried steak was good and so was the casserole though it coulda been hotter and crispier but it was still great great food great price great service i wo nt be eating for another hours probably food coma time goodnight
the best of phoenix issue did not disappoint me or my daughter i got a delicious combination of spiciness the complimentary chips come with a variety of dips  salsa bean dip and some kind of creamy goodness the daughter was a little skeptical of all three options so more for me i see other reviews referring to four dips so maybe i was drunk off of over eating at the end they give you a sapodilla to ensure that your belly is full and round the daughter was happy about that and i had to roll myself back to the car
i came for lunch and am very happy i did i was very impressed with the variety of options for pho beef soup the broth is delicious and chili sauce crushed chili in oil and sriracha are well stocked at every table they are pretty generous with the fresh basil sprouts and jalapeos i was sold when i saw the menu online it definitely looked like the real deal holyfield pho with tendon tripe brisket and all of the fixin s  oh yeah i m gonna eat that the service was good enough for dining alone they pretty much bring you your food and leave you the heck alone to stuff your face in peace that might not be ideal for a large group though the ambiance is very utilitarian which i like actually the strong flavorful iced coffee with sweetened condensed milk ended my meal perfectly i think i ve found my regular pho spot
i always turn to yelp when exploring a new place i ve never been it was my first time visiting tempe az i thought to myself where is everybody  driving around on the road in the middle of the day it was degrees out and there were nt that many people out then i went into harlow s for brunch due to yelp recommendations and realized everyone was here lol but really i think everyone is indoors when it s hot out the food here was phenomenal i had the eggs benedict perfect taste and perfect portion this is how all eggs benedict should be my boyfriend enjoyed his meal as well lrb biscuits and gravy rrb and the service was great
baseball should not be played in a dome but then again this is arizona and it s ridiculously hot outside that being said chase field was handed down from the baseball gods to phoenix and it has not disappointed one bit i ve sat all around this stadium and there is not one bad seat to be had even at the top in the nose bleed section you have the kid zone which looks fun for the kids lrb about years too old for that rrb and fridays front row lrb lots of fun for adults rrb it is very kid friendly from the music to the mascot to the activities between innings the fans are some of the greatest in the league and very friendly beware the team store though you could go broke there will all the cool things to buy now for what i rate best the food is surprisingly good for a ballpark besides the old school hot dogsodacracker jacks combo s there is decent mexican food peter piper pizza fatburger lrb my favorite rrb panda express and cold stone ice cream booze prices are inflated naturally since you have no choice but it s a small price to pay all in all i ve pushed aside my belief that baseball should not be played indoors and now enjoy visiting this fine establishment
loved this bar wish we had one in oklahoma try the ahi
ask for mayo clinic rate great hotel clean and sanitary
this is one of my favorite places to eat when i get back to town their beans are the best i ve had their tacos are made of shredded beef and fried with the fillings inside this makes the best product all of you lucky enough to live in the state do nt realize how lucky you are to have this treat i m usually not an enchilada fan but you have to try one here some of the reviews comment on decor while it is true the place is a little shabby and the salsa comes in squeeze bottles i would much rather have their cheap prices than fine china and that salsa i really would be tempted to steal one of those bottles but then i d have to check it in my bag to go back home
some of the best street tacos in town i ve eaten at this location twice and the one in newport twice its about time they opened one up in az the hand crafted margaritas are amazing  jalapeno cucumber margarita and frozen beer are my personal favorites
schizophrenic fun at reasonable prices  what else could you want from an antiques mall sure there s some stalls full of what looks like garage sale leftovers but most of the stuff is solid  a nice blend of furniture and larger items admixed with the trinkets and collectibles i never ever ever leave empty handed even if it s just a few old pyrex lab beakers or vintage liquor promo glasses the only problem with this place is that it takes way too much time to really do it right
wow this place is great had the hardtofind part that i needed gave me terrific advice and was just generally very helpful highly recommend
i am one of those weirdos who come to sweet tomatoes for salad and vegetarian soup you know healthy food food that makes your colon look up to you and say thank you to which you reply no thank you i do nt come here for the greasy bready pizza and flavorless oldpeople pasta  although the lemon cream and caper pasta is so delicious i want to fill a swimming pool with it and but i digress so how hard is this right  it s a salad bar get fresh veg cut it up serve it have competent dressings lrb their greek is quite good rrb and bam  you re done lrb except for an ironic month a while back where they had signs up about not having any tomatoes on the bar because of some crop devastation or i do nt know what rrb ah but the soups  what i love about sweet tomatoes versus other salad joints which shall go unnamed is their soups they always have a couple of vegetarian options and they are uniformly delicious lrb if somewhat lacking in salt but let s get real  this place is for geriatrics not soccer parents rrb another thing i appreciate about sweet tomatoes is that they do nt try to get their busboys to act like they re waiters thanks no i do nt need a glass of phoenix tapwater ice for my bottle of purified water thanks no i doubt i m going to need to ask you for anything it s selfserve but they do come around and offer you cookies those are the kinds of nice touches that make me come back
the cheese course was definitely interesting and my vanilla milkshake was rich and creamy this place rocks i just wish they were closer  rrb
wow i just returned home after eating at milagro grill and let me tell youi do nt want to eat anything else because i never want the taste in my mouth to go away it was fantastic i enjoyed the pollo tacos and the person i was with had the al pastori snuck a taste and the flavors were out of this world the service was fantastic from the moment we walked in to the moment we were out the door the chef has mad skills and we will be back because i live close and the food is worth it just go
during my solo vacation in phoenix i decided to check out ticoz for dinner on a night when i wanted to put on a dress and look cute the ambiance of the restaurant was great and suitable for my attire lrb you can be casual or slightly dressy and still fit in rrb since i was by myself i sat at the bar which is small  but sufficient there are no tvs which is good if you want to socialize and do nt care about sports the music was great and i immediately felt at home when i heard los amigos invisibles playing rrb the bartender and rest of the wait staff were pleasant and efficient they were cute too but i immediately knew i was in a gayfriendly establishment so they were unattainable but regardless of their preference michael was particularly nice and chatted with me telling me about various places to go for fun in the area this is always nice when you re new to an area and by yourself i did nt order an alcoholic drink but my sprite was miraculously refilled several times without my even asking  so kudos to the bartender for taking care of me i ordered enchiladas topped with pork at the recommendation of the bartender and they were delicious quite a large serving for me a petite female but delicious all the same a great restaurant with great decor and atmosphere one comment  this place needs a dance floor so folks can get their salsa on
this is one of my favorite places for lunch its a cute little place full of light and great for either a quick stop or a relaxing lunch all their food is delicious and well portioned very fresh and outstanding in flavor my favorite is their fresh brewed iced tea and corner chopped salad
i had the same dentist for over years and decided to try someone new i had no idea just how outdated my old dentist s equipment was until i had something to compare it to the staff is awesome and the atmosphere relaxing great customer care and service highly recommended lisa
the line was ridiculous the price is kind of steep for what it is the dog is kind of messy because of the way it s made but you know what  i enjoyed it in a way i have nt enjoyed a hot dog in years wow that sounds kind of dirty this really is a unique take on one of the most common american foods i passed through the sea of trucks and people that is food truck fridays on a mission to finally try the much yelped about short leash dogs i ca nt say much too much that has nt already been said while the minute wait was nt too thrilling it all paid off in the end i just went with a traditional wiener with tomatoes onion relish and spicy mustard while i was intrigued to try some of short leash dog s specialties most of the dogs on today s menu contained an item or two that i do nt really like and i wanted to compare short leash dogs to what i am accustomed to the first time around good sausage good toppings and the flat bread is fantastic i would happily join lindsey f by tying my leash to the cart and following them around town and i did nt even know that i still enjoyed hot dogs that much without a beer and a game
i have watched up close and person the career of this great chef this restaurant is wonderful it is everything that you think it should be it is homey and comfortable the food is high quality but not pretentious the sauces used are a perfect compliment to the featured items the preparations were delicious prices are comfortable maybe it is the little things that make this a great regular dine out spot the water at table side is ro and wonderful the wines by the glass are well assorted and affordable servers were well trained efficient but homey if you are looking for that place for the regular night out this is it
great food fast waiters and i love the chocolate covered coconut things so delicious
i love this place best horchata in phoenix lrb you have to get it early though because they keep it cold with ice so by late in the day it is slightly watered down and the ideal heterogeneous concentration is lost rrb the food court inside is amazing i have been there more times than you and have never had a problem with any of the food or staff sometimes communication can be difficult when ordering but if you know exactly what you want lrb like me rrb or unless you are fluent in spanish lrb which i am not rrb there should be no problem so no lallygagging around and no special orders the constant excitement added with a little bit of the english vs spanish war gives you the warmth and feel of a truly authentic phoenix super market food court lrb i am sure there is some special name for it in the hispanic culture or at least something that sounds cooler than food court rrb i am fortunate that within my lifetime to have lived within a minute drive of the ranch market and i miss it dearly i know there are a lot of grocery stores called ranch market throughout the valley but when you live anywhere near this one it is the only ranch market you will acknowledge go there get a  pound of carnitas from the cooked meat section it comes with corn tortillas and some green salsasauceconcoction that goes with it great do nt forget the beans and rice salsa bar is on the left on the way out the prices are great best bang for your buck in this town
i was lucky enough to have flowers by jodi put together the floral for my wedding last weekend she did an amazing job jodi is a character just hilarious she heard exactly what i want and nailed it her prices were fair as well
we have been wanting try this great find for sometime but it always slipped our minds until i saw it on the restaurant week list because they were so booked they extended restaurant week to the following weekend as well so i was able to get reservations and surprise my boyfriend for a great date night the meal was a three course meal for which to us was a bargain and for what you get we had the gnocchi appetizer and the oregon lobster mushroom appetizer a new mushroom for us but wo nt be our last every bite of both appetizers was very palate pleasing for the salad we had the halibut and the beet salad again we were not disappointed for our main dish i had the tritip and he had the pork porterhouse both dishes were very satisfying we bought out wine from az wine to drink with dinner todd is the general manager of atlas and very knowledgeable of wines so he helped us pick one out and it went really well with our meal ca nt wait to visit this place again this is a great date night place or if you want to impress your parents or out of town guests but call ahead to make reservations if they do nt have a reservation that night they do nt open the only complaint we had was that the appetizer and salads were so big that we were too full to eat our main meal so a lot came home with us
on my first trip here i had a very good one i beat the lunch time rush hour and i ordered a bacon cheese burger the burger was cooked to order and very delicious i wanna come back here during breakfast hours so i can try out a few things i saw on the menu i have had some bad experiences with local cafes in the past but i will be back to this location in the future as long as a certain waitress is there to help me erin  rrb
this is a different type of dining experience from the outside it looks like an ordinary building but the inside is nicely decorated wines selections are great staff are super friendly especially for a momnpop restaurant the food lrb crepes rrb is definitely over the top it s a specialty restaurant meaning that you must really enjoy crepes to be able to appreciate what the owner s pride and their creativity of their food selections it s not by any mean a fancy french dining but it s definitely a favorite local place i enjoy dining here every single time whether with friends family or with my nieces and nephews the kids and i are throughly enjoy the crepesbar by the kitchen especially when we see the chefs prepare our favorite desserts on that note this place is a gem so come out and support the local business i dine here at least once or twice per month
we tried this place today because of all of the great reviews it has received here we were not disappointed the jerk chicken was mouth watering and the patty was excellent the service was great and they are extremely nice and friendly they even gave all three of us a sample of their homemade carrot cake trust me you have to try it we will definitely be going back
great pizza i highly recommend the rye guy special ricotta cheese sausage and red bell peppers to die for
jared blake entertainment was truly the best wedding dj entertainment package i ve ever seen and i ve been to a ton of weddings the additional musicians were amazing too and added such a uniqueness to the event all the songs were terrific we had so much fun dancing and jared himself mc d and he was fantastic what a great affair i would definitely hire him for my next big event
blue nile is one of my favorite places in tempe i get something different almost every time i go and i have been happy with everything i ve eaten i especially like their vegetarian dishes lrb more than the meat ones which is surprising because i m a big meat eater rrb and i love their sambussas so good also their lunch special is great because for around dollars you can get a vegetarian entree a meat entree and two sambussas
in my last update i stated that the italian beef did nt quite do it for me i just had one today and it was completely awesome totally soaked and they gave me extra juice to boot i ve also had a pizza puff and a slider the pizza puff was dead on its all the greasiness and crispiness and gooiness that i remember from the chi the slider was tasty but do nt confuse this with any white castle offerings both of these are cheap and worth tacking onto any order what can i say  i love this place
i was first introduced to green through a friend who had her birthday dinner catered by green and later visited the scottsdale road location this was over years ago soon after i learned that green was opening a location just down the street from my home in phoenix this is by far one of my favorite places in phoenix i have yet to try everything on the menu the service is always friendly the drinks are always refreshing and the bathrooms are always clean if you like green on facebook you can stay up to date with the specials that green has to offer and at which location
i love this place and not just because it was the site of my st date with my bf it s quaint romantic and the food is generally excellent though we tend to order the same things every time  truffle pomme frites with dipping sauces including house made ketchup frisee salad oysters and any of their souffles the bar is fun though it can get loud we generally avoid the dining room unless we can sit next to the windows or the mini eiffel tower several of the tables have an unpleasant view of the service area and are in the pathway of the restrooms our favorite is the garden patio which has great ambiance with nicely situated tables twinkle lights plants heaters or misters depending on the season very romantic if you re not sitting near some of the loudmouth scottsdalites who apparently are  regulars the front and side patios are fun too  great for people watching service is generally good but can be spotty in the dining room that s the only reason it s not stars for me there s a great waitress on the patio  tiny blond young woman whose name escapes me she knows the menu always has great recommendations and is incredibly attentive to all her tables bar service is always fantastic so happy to have this has our neighborhood french place  great food great ambiance great people
love this place feel like i m back home in new york when i eat here usually get boneless spareribs with pork fried rice or chicken and broccoli with pfr
tommyv s is the place to be  ambiance atmosphere integrity and the highest commitment to quality food and st class customer service their extensive happy hour lrb am  pm rrb is not your standard fare  organic gluten free and oneofakind items like butternut squash ravioli brie gnocchi and short rib sliders will tantalize your tastebuds without tormenting your wallet  apps from  classy casual and cool tommy v s is a sure thing trust me  and try it for yourself the owners chef and staff truly care about the customer experience and welcome your honest feedback i know i for one like to feel valued and appreciated as a comsumer in this marketplace

been going there for years love the food and the service is great when i have my japanese counterparts in town that is the only place they want to go for sushi if you are looking for a show sake bombers and assembly line manufactured rolls this is not the place for you if you want fresh fish at reasonable prices this is the place to go
wow really love this place i really do great place to take kids on a scorching hott day there raspados are fresh tasty and for a very good price the place is super clean and the people are very nice cool and fun with a great smile on thier faces everytime i go try the diablito the best one there
this is one of those true gems of the area the restaurant itself looks super rundown lrb located right next to a liquor store and  smoke shop rrb but the quality to price ratio is just ridiculously high i can not recommend the fish tacos enough if you live in the valley you have to visit this place at least once maybe not on a first date though on a side note my wife is basically a known name at this place her entire office orders every tuesday for lunch it started out just her and then as news of how good and cheap atoyac is spread around everyone was ordering
love lustre bar it s on the nd floor of hotel palomar at cityscape hotel palomar is already on top of cityscape so the nd floor offers a great view of the city we went for happy hour on friday and had a blast they have signature cocktails  off most wines and several apps and flatbreads for under i had the pulled duck flatbread with apples and gruyere which was dynamite i also had this drink called ruppels somethingorother that s my new fave drink for now it s prosecco honey allspice liquore and i think lemonade awesomeness the atmosphere at lustre is super chill open air rooftop bar with a great live dj a bit later in the evening and a pool to have drinks by all in all i could nt ask for more out of a cool downtown rooftop bar
i recommend the golden medium wings saucy  extra crispy they may take a hot minute to come out but that s because they are made fresh and not pre cooked they are definitely worth the wait cheers
when planning our trip to scottsdale i knew that greasewood flat was one of the places we definitely wanted to check out but for some reason we waited until the night before we left to finally check it out now i wish we d gone when we first arrived on a sunday night the whole atmosphere of the place was perfect it s so simple yet it just feels so right from the outdoor picnic tables to the chickens the cat who sat and watched us eat and then the jackasses we saw running wild as we were driving back out  this place said southwest like nothing else we saw during our trip the menu is also simple  burgers and dogs and they come with potato chips lrb or corn chips with the chili dog rrb no fries but we did nt miss them i had a burger and i think it was the best thing i had while we were there it was cooked so perfectly hubby had the chili dog and he really loved it i m sure this is one place we will definitely go back to on future trips to scottsdale
fantastic every time o go to the rokerij it gets better definitely the most solid restaurant in phoenix in my eyes the carne adovada is the shit hard to even order different dishes when it s this good i prefer eating in the downstairs bar  the place is like a bunker no at  t service so you can just turn your phone off and kick back i can say that the jalapeo and rokerij benedicts are killer as well great enchiladas i could go on and on
this place exceeds any expectation i ever had for brunch the food was fresh the service was amazing when you eat at wright s you get so much for your money you will leave this place satisfied beyond belief by far the best eggs benedict in all of phoenixscottsdale the breakfast buffet that is included with your meal was amazing it is pricey but so worth it
my quick summary sky s the limit with burger invention and fresh ingredients i absolutely love blu burger i ve always found traditional burgers so boring blu burger is my burger mecca they have too many ingredients to list lrb meat types bun types toppings sauces etc rrb so you can mix  match combine and taste test to you heart s desire the staff is friendly super attentive and quite charming there s never a long wait for anything and they really treat you like family they will work with any request you have i wanted to try a couple different toppings  sauces to find what i liked best so to cater to my known insanity they brought everything out on separate little plates  bowls for me i settled with goat cheese  green chilies on a black angus burger on a whole wheat bun the burgers are always cooked to perfection they have options for meat lovers  vegetarians alike the fries are always crispy  delicious their side salad is always super fresh  crisp they re even kind enough to bring the dressing on the side so it s never a case of no dressing or drowned in dressing a am now a proud regular  will not be leaving any time soon
i went to z tejas with a bunch of people lrb about rrb last night we had a great experience from start to finish at the beginning my lady and i were early so the waiter got us our drinks and continued to make sure we were good to go we wanted to wait for our friends so food was nt necessary at this time but the drinks were flowing and the waiter lrb jeff rrb was very cool friendly and down to earth all of our friends showed up and we let the good times roll chips and salsa drinks water and the delicious cornbread they all came very fast and it did nt take any begging on our part i got a chicken dish which was really good i stuffed myself silly my lady got a side salad which was huge she could nt even finish it and she said it was really good oh and the food came fast by the way lrb surprising when you have people the overall vibe of the place is really cool very trendy and fancy but reasonable prices big screens everywhere gotta love that since there were some great college fb games on last night great experience thanks jeff  z tejas

i had nothing but great service food is excellent and now with the light rail i can actually enjoy a ride to tempe without the long ride there the best is the lettuce wraps and to be honest with you after i eat that i do nt even have to have dinner just drinks
we ve stayed here twice now for spring training lrb sf giants rrb i can not say enough on the service and the amenities they were very friendly and the kids lrb ages rrb took full advantage of the lazy river and small water slide as well as many other activities they offered they had a blast the lounge is perfect for hanging out and having a bite to eat the gym was nt crowded so i got in and out in min it is a little small for a resort of that size we ve stayed here twice lrb peak season rrb and do nt really have any complaints
really extensive native american indian museum in phoenix the cover all aspects of history culture and just about anything else went here with my australian friend because he was interested in it a lot of the material will be familiar for anyone who s grown up with it as part of history class but even so the exhibits are very well done and you ll learn a lot definitely recommend the museum if you re in the area the student discount was also pretty sweet
legit pizza for a very reasonable price quick delivery is a major plus as well
amazing food i was nt so sure about indian food as visiting this place was my first time at both the restaurant and the food itself i had the chicken tikki marsala and it was fantastic i ca nt wait to go back
there s absolutely nothing stupid about this cupid s little paradise what a fun gift shop i found stupid cupid hidden in a small strip mall just north of th and camelback road true to the adorable melrose district this is a quaint and cute boutique filled with some of the best little gift finds around i like to call this next paragraph all about candles i walked in and was immediately welcomed by a scrumptious smell of candles candles surrounded by more candles candles of every shape and size candles of every price range from to i saw organic candles seasonal candles classic ones locally made candles and candles made by those featured on oprah i am pretty sure that i ve found my one stop candle shop in stupid cupid but besides candles they have other great little gifts including a fun wine bottle holder containing a knitted santa outfit you dress wine with they have cards made by a local artist that say what you always wish you could say in a card but never have the nerve to they have trinkets and table tops and everything else you can think of i will definitely be back to stupid cupid when i begin my holiday shopping the owner was so friendly and helpful and i learned that they even host various shopping events to encourage local shopping so this season i m definitely showing local businesses the holiday love and will happily empty out my pocket book at a shop such as stupid cupid

still loving this resort almost years later just got back from a short trip for a little rr with my better half we were put in a remodeled casita mental note to anyone reading this ask for a remodeled casita the one we were in years ago was definitely nitce but a little rustic these remodeled ones are seriously posh and quite modern and in my previous review i was dinging them on their old ghetto shower heads well the new shower heads are those gigantic rainforest things with little water holes where you just want to stay under it forever the bathroom floors are heated marble talk about decadent staff was still amazingly friendly with every whim taken care of their lodge restaurant also serves up a crazily tasty breakfast  we did nt even bother to venture out any morning because we were so impressed with the servings locally except the coffee  nothing to write home about beware the red cardinal bird at the lodge restaurant which will try to make off with your dental work literally  some poor guy s tooth was flown away with we ll be back hopefully sooner rather than later love you boulders do nt ever change lrb well except for the remodeling rrb ps did i mention that we conceived our little boy here  good place to go for serious relaxation
great price and staff clean and modern rooms pets stay free would definitely stay here again
we were in phoenix for a thanksgiving vacation  five of us and everyone wanted mexican so we yelped a place for dinner and decided on padres the food was great the service as well  and it had a friendly and positive atmosphere as well the food is really excellent  more real mexican than american mexican  which is a good thing by my standards it was reasonable by bay area standards anyway  and worthwhile if i go back to phoenix i would definitely revisit thanks for a great evening
federico s may look like david but their food is more like the size of goliath they produce some absolutely mouthwatering authentic mexican food that will fill your tummy to the brim without emptying your pockets per the picture that i posted they have burritos and  cent tacos on monday tuesday and wednesday the burritos are enough to fill you for an entire meal so if you are operating on a budget you can spend here and have enough to eat for three full days or on another note if you need to feed six people for that can be accomplished as well the burritos come with your choice of beans  cheese red chicken lrb ie chicken in red salsa rrb green chili pork or shredded beef the tacos can include all those and ground beef but not the green chili pork i do nt eat pork but i can say that the red chicken and shredded beef burritos are off the hook in taste and are about inches long and inches wide so move over subway there is a new inch delight in town the carne asada and fajita burritos are also good the service is also cordial and quick along with only a  minute wait the girl at the cashier gives great recommendations they also have a drivethru and some outdoor seating so next time you pass this place on camelback make a uturn and get yourself some of the best mexican food in the area
best cheesesteaks in town hands down
seriously i m not just talking out of my ass when i announce best grilled chicken and carne asada ever they only serve grilled lrb beyond marinated rrb chicken on the bone and carne asada both of which you may order   or the combo with both lrb all come with corn or flour tortillas rrb which explains why such greatness that is stars is involved in the concentration on main items now on to the main points  meal will set you back only to bones per person cash only  chicken may be ordered white or dark and is the most flavorful and crispy grilled ignore the reddyed skin it will be the best grilled chicken you have ever had  carne asada is always cooked to perfection not overcooked or stringy or chewy always is carne asada greatness  not only do meals come with your choice of flour or corn tortillas they come with perfectly salted pinto beans lrb not refried rrb fresh salsa and red onions that seems to have been soaked lrb not pickled rrb reducing their flavor to a delicious subtle onion instead of a crunchy onion  salsa is a tomatoey pureed lrb not over pureed rrb juicy salsa that screams freshness with every bite  lastly the bliss of the foodgasm experienced when the tortillachicken or beef or both chicken and beef mmmonionssalsa  and sourcream for those that enjoy a lil sin explode in your mouth with flavors you only dreamed of is the reason you must go here asap
if i were one of those reviewers who had to give you a bunch of background about myself why my review should carry more weight than others due to some kind of arbitrary expertise and how i came to visit the establishment that time i would tell you that i only recently moved to the area and after trying pho tahn less than a couple months ago i ve been on a pho kick and that while i do nt know good pho i do know what i like my expertise then comes from a history of enjoying big cauldrons of soupsstews when temperatures drop below and oftentimes enjoying menudo to fend off hangovers lrb those my last menudo bowl for such necessity was years ago thank goodness rrb by virtue of trying to visit pho tahn on it s day off i tried da vang and frankly was pleased enough to continue you going there alas friday night i was running late and it was nt going to be feasible for us to make da vang before they closed and after a phone call to pho tahn revealed that they are closed for unexplained reasons until the middle of december i decided to try my luck even deeper into the avenues and try maxim with it s liberal p closing time after missing the restaurant on our first shot lrb it does nt really face th ave the strip mall faces north so it s tough to see if you are coming from osborne rrb we parked and entered as others have noted the place is extremely clean which was a pleasant surprise and the server was very nice pointing out for example if whitey orders any dishes with tripetendon the food is good and the dishes at the tables around us who had not ordered pho looked very good in short i d say it s a toss up between maxim and da vang  and that s a good thing both are star pho places and that is good enough for me
this place is amazing amazing selection of stuff lrb ethnic produce meats deli items bakery and ice cream rrb they sell several regional brands from the pacific nw i ve been told if you are a homesick seattleite who has relocated here amazing prices seriously it s like costco except you can buy in quantities that do nt require you to bring a towalong trailer with you to the store you need to be selective with produce sometimes because some of it can be ripe in the store so i find it does nt last long at home i ve noticed this mostly with tomatoes and asparagus beautiful in the store but you d better plan on eating them right away the inside is warehousy but much nicer than food city foodless and walmart my only minor annoyances are rrb you can only walk in one direction lrb down the specials hall of fame rrb when you enter the store if i want to pick up a loaf of bread and some eggs it ll take me a few minutes just to get there rrb this place can get seriously crowded like ditch the cart at the end of the aisle so you can weave down the aisle to pick up what you need and bring it back good news is that it s lrb also amazingly rrb open hrsday and it can be very manageable at offpeak times i find myself wondering how they can stay in business so much stuff and such low prices in an industry that i know operates on razorthin margins tip  selfcheckout machines are supereasy to use lrb even for produce rrb and rarely back up tip  if you get them when they re fresh their bagels are excellent
i was introduced to andre plus years ago when he was working out of his house i followed him to his second house and now to the present location i am echoing the other positive reviews before me andre is not only a great mechanic has saved me a lot of money with his honesty and integrity there have been times where he has nt charged me for specific fixes or has given me a great discount you can judge any business by how it looks it is clean and orderly which is rare for a mechanic s shop the cleanliness reflects andre s attitude toward his service this is one mechanic who will not rip you off the consistent topnotch service honesty and pricing is what keeps me coming back keep up the good work andre

let s face it there are a lot of places to get a good gourmet burger including my back yard but the yummiest burgers are at lobby s lobby makes the rest look average whenever i am in the tempe area i always make it a point to pick up and take home burgers lrb you can dine in as well rrb if you are in the mood for a juicy burger lrb and quick rrb they are way better than any fast food but not priced much higher and they are actually better than most sitdown restaurant s burgers great seasoning lightly toasted bun special sauce and made to order  simple or the works they have other items on the menu but i have nt gotten past the burgers yet for god s sake ask for the specially prepared peppers on your burger baby lrb methinks they are stewed and dang they re good rrb plus  you know you love it when the owner takes your order lobby works the joint himself most days
barrio queen is in old town scottsdale near the waterfront the restaurant occupies a relatively small space compared to its neighbors and is connected to silvana bistro we sat at the table facing the entrance with the jose cuervo mirrored sign stylized hood cover from a car and three tequila certificates the don julio print on the paper place maps seemed to indicate that there was some descent tequila served at barrio queen we enjoyed the simple three margarita with the don that arrived in a plastic pacifico pitcher my daughter had a cheese and mushroom quesadilla thick with cheese mushrooms and onions she got past the blueness of the blue corn tortilla and the onions and consumed all of it the guacamole came chunky spicy and highly recommended by our waiter we polished it off quickly still hungry near our seats were black and white barrio queen shirts and food stuffs in cages the draft from the door was cold and unrelenting as patrons entered and exited within site of our table was a frida khaloesque painting that had been barrio queened a monitor with a slide show of employees ingredients and food and a bar with pastries caged liquor and beers on tap and in a refrigerator the primary item fifty of them are fancy street tacos each is a single but everyone s order comes on their own plates i highly recommend the barrio pollo y chorizo the chorizo was really good the chorizo y al pastor was good and the cameron con coco was okay four tacos and some of an appetizer seemed to be enough for a meal adding some dessert was too much the churro was something to behold as it was topped with caramel and ice cream
awesome dinner here for my friends birthday the bartender kris was great and showed off his mixing skills and flaming shots lrb delish rrb our server gibb was a blast super fun and knew a ton about the menu so he did nt steer us wrong in what we ordered love the mac n cheese chop salad scallops and the short ribs just the right amount of food for of us to share ca nt wait to come back and we ll be sure to spread the word rrb

this is a dangerous place for me i could seriously do my bank account some damage as i love love love this store the candles are the best anywhere they burn very clean and the fragrance lasts until they burn out i just bought the kumquat scented candles and they smell delish there s so many cool home furnishings here as well unique nonmainstream stuff that s fairly reasonable in i ve actually got my eye on this really cool apothecary cabinet purchasing it may be in my very near future
i love this place been coming here since it was old chicago i miss the  round the world beer thing that oc had but so what boulders reminds me of oc but even better great food great staff a crowd that is a nice mix of students and other folks a real neighborhood bar with just enough college vibe but not so much that anyone over feels painfully outofplace came in recently with a big group we sat upstairs and the service was a tad tardy but i completely understood we did nt realize how big our group would be they shanghai d extra wait staff to keep us all happy and i gotta say we were happy love the bigass nachos and hell pretty much everything there the only complaint i would ever have about their food is that recently i had some kind of stuffed burger and the meat just was not cooked thoroughly enough and it took so long to get my order that i really was nt about to send it back and wait even longer but hey shit happens sometimes this is by far the exception there i will keep coming back love ya boulder s if only you could open up one by my area of phoenix
i have nt seen paul in years which makes me sad he was my childhood dentist from my first tooth all the way into my sophomore year in college unfortunately i have nt seen the dentist and years and my health coverage does nt reach his network i recently went to another dentist and it paled in comparison to the experience i had with him to be honest i felt like dollar signs were hovering over me at all times thankfully i found he is within cigna s ppo network and next year i will quickly add him as my primary dentist when we get to choose plans i do nt care about charges etc he is the best i never was scared to see him and you never saw any staff turnover best example could be that my original dental assistant was with me from the first cleaning until the last and i believe she is actually still there his offices are cleaner than clean you always get top quality service and while i was there i never once second guessed their advice or service mind you all this is coming from my experience as a child at this office by far the toughest demographic to comfort i ca nt wait to go back and say hi to the staff they were all pretty much family to me they always would ask for an update on my life and genuinely cared about me and my teeth not dollar figures sitting in a chair this is an awesome practice to take your entire family to their service will stand the test of time message me if you want more detail other things quickly to point out is that their equipment is top notch and services they assist with are everreaching but once again message me if you have extra q s
great little thai spot old wendy s restaurant that has beeen converted into a quaint nicely decorated dimly lit little spot i have tried dishes from here and they have all been fabulous full of flavor and spice i ve tried the pad thai cashew chicken shrimp basil thai green curry and choo chee seafood lrb oh and the crispy thai rolls rrb and they have all been great hard to come by good thai in phoenix but i hope this place sticks around excellent service as well my only complaint would be that the music they were playing could have been a little more upbeat for a friday night  rrb will be coming back again and again
total wine is bevmo in years like bevmo graduated college has a real job and cares about quality do nt get me wrong i still love bevmo but total wine makes me feel like an adult an adult who loves alcohol and finding a deal i am on a mission to find a particular chilean carmenere i had at dinner while in seattle lrb alpatagua  if you see it let me know rrb while i could purchase it online i thought it would be a lot more fun searching local wine stores for this particular bottle first stop was total wine while i did not find what i was looking for i had fun looking the aisles are organized a bit funky french and italian wines seemed to have their own section but others were organized by type lrb cabernet pinot noir on other aisles rrb i did find their south american and south african wines a bit lacking two wine producing areas i m having fun exploring right now i did love that they had arizona wines they had a good selection of dos cabezas arizona stronghold and callaghan vineyards it is nt all wine there is beer and liquor but since my search was for wine i did nt really give it a look i do plan to return and take a look at the beers while the store is small it definitely does not have any of that industrial feeling a bevmo has it feels much more like a wine shop i love that it s more inviting
the consummate beer bar great selection knowledgeable bartenders and eclectic patrons what more can you want from a drinking establishment  the food is good too
this place is amazing went there last night after an ochem lab with a friend we ate good hummus pita wrap couscous salad the hummus was amazing i have to admit it was my first hummus experience but it was great everything was super fresh and light which was great the pita wrap was amazing again you could taste the freshness everything was cooked perfectly the service was great food was fast everything was perfect
the decor inside made me think if fez opened up an ice cream shop it would look like this i m not too big on sweets but i find myself craving their ice cream a lot sweet republic also offers free wifi and board games so you can hang out and enjoy your ice cream i just moved into the neighborhood and i can see myself becoming a regular here
definitely one of my favorite places small local mexican restaurant with bold flavors the staff are always friendly and the restaurant is very clean as you walk in you can see the kitchen where the food is being prepared you can see how they probably have the best shredded beef chimichanga with their homemade salsa and guacamole i m torn between that and the chile relleno both are delicious and authentic this is a local favorite and i will keep coming back
the wegde salad is wonderfully blue cheesy and always enjoy the entrees also love there sorbets
first visit was during happy hour on a friday at the scottsdale quarter let me just say best damn happy hour around and not just cause of the drink specials the sushi specials can not be beat dragon roll or las vegas roll for that s just insanely good the service is top notch we did not go without anything i took a sip of my ice tea she was there to replenish the whole experience was amazing the sushi can not be beat fresh and top quality and i know my sushi
the best food ever fast friendly fresh and very clean oh yeah cheap just the best there is and you never leave hungry
pizzeria bianco delivers on a great handmade wood fired traditional pizza its touch to dethrone my personal la favorite pizza from mozza but bianco is right there at the line i had been warned about the long waits and seen them first hand in the evenings walking home from the stadium so i slipped in right at for the start of lunch i got a table right away and was able to enjoy a great meal without feeling rushed in any way i would definitely suggest trying for weekday lunch if you want to miss the crowds the pizza was really good with the great wood fired flavor that you can only experience in a few spots such as bianco and mozza the dough and crust were perfect i was really impressed with the crust that took on a great caramelized taste right around the edges do nt run from what you think may be burnt spots embrace the caramelized doughy bliss i sampled the margherita which i consider the ultimate pizza to judge a spot by and the wiseguy because it sounded great and i could not pass up house smoked mozzarella the margherita passed the test with flying colors the basil had a great aromatic presence that perfectly complimented the great tomato sauce the wiseguy was impressive and the smoked mozzarella complimented the wood fired greatness of the pizza as a whole well done pizzeria bianco if phoenix were my hometown then you would be my top craft pizza spot in the states
awesome huevos rancheros
so the funny thing about good restaurants is that you almost do nt want to tell anyone about them and make it so you have to wait to get in that is how i pretty much feel about rokerij i made the mistake of telling my soon to be ex husband about it lrb prior d day rrb and now i have to worry about him showing up with his gf and i am there with someone sooo that being said i really like this restaurant can i tell you tho that i only go downstairs to eat waaay cooler stairs are a little tricky down kinda thinkin that they are not up to code and an accident waiting to happen maybe i could get a free meal  hmm ok back to the restaurant the downstairs bar is a funky copper and there are seats in front of the big fireplace lrb i never get the chance to sit there darn it rrb and all the seating in the restaurant lrb upstairs and down rrb is booth love that much more cozy their wine selection is pretty good i pretty much have the klinker brick red all the time my fave dish there is their cornflake crusted halibut w  salsa deelish and their corn side is amazing roasted corn and the main man and i were stabbing each other over it he always has the mashed potatoes as a side and they come in this little kettle that is super hot just warnin you i am not much of a potato person but he says that they are good so i will have to take his word i even like their house salad has chunks of bleu cheese and if i remember right cranberries btw rokerij you used to have spiced pecans in the salad too but they are gone i have a very sad face right now sooo that s what i think the rokerij is a great date place lrb but only plan on bringing someone you are really into otherwise later when you break up you may have an embarrassing encounter there rrb and perfect for the holidays
great venue for quality acts  and with good prices and fantastic table service yes it s a classic basic music venue but the staff make it comfortable and fun and a special thanks for returning a lost cell phone and refusing to take any sort of reward you just do nt find that kind of honesty and spirit often enough any more we will be back
ok it s time to admit it this is one of my top favorite places in phoenix and it s a crime i have waited this long to give it the full stars it deserves great staff great atmosphere and pitchers and glasses of wine on sat and sun afternoons just imagine how all of this can improve your love life social life married life life life are you imagining  i do nt think you are fine do nt imagine get on your cruiser keds vespa pinto and get over to postino for the best bruschetta in town top wine selection rotating beers and top patio
service at this location is superb and worth the wait when they are busy price and selection are awesome too
it s saturday night and i have not eaten much all day i had read some reviews about philly cheesesteaks and was kind of craving one i checked around on yelp and found forefathers so off we went we pulled up and walked in looked at the menu on the wall and ordered i had the standard cheessteak with peppers and onions and sweet potato fries my daughter had the fox off the children s menu it was chicken strips and fries with a drink the young man working the counter was polite and friendly we got our drinks and sat down there are about tables inside and about outside the place was was clean and tidy when my order was ready i went to pick it up and the young man asked if there was anything else i needed i said no we were good but when i went back to the table they had forgotten the ranch for my daughter s chicken strips she is and very independent so she went up to ger her ranch the young man was apologetic and asked and gave her two cups of ranch instead of one she was happy and she said her meal was yummy my cheesesteak was so good great flavor tendor meat and fresh roll and the cheese just oozed out yum the sweet potato fries were great too refillable drinks too while we were eating my daughter was looking at the pictures of benjamin franklin george washington and thomas jefferson we had a nice little history lesson while we were eating she also liked the lighting she said it looked like a party there were lights draped from the ceiling along with the regular lighting and with the high ceilings it did have a sort of patio feeling being a parent i have probably seen bathrooms in every place we have ever been to the grocery store gas station and restaurants the restroom here was fantastic when i opened the door it was not at all what i expected it had nice tile and the faucet had a fancy spikett that turned on automatically when you put your hands under it there was a nice smelling soap and lots of paper towels too and it smelled nice in there yes it smelled nice not like a bathroom at all and it was clean i m not from philly but i know what i like and this was a darn good cheesesteak thank you forefathers
pure is unfortunately my new sushi place this blows because it s all the way out in the boonies for chrissakes it s on like th street and hayden lrb no offense kristen rrb so there s that but they are expanding to old town which only puts them light years away from me as opposed to woohoo i m complainy right now because of all the boozy bowling last night with you yelpers fyi at any rate try the veggie tempura it s absolutely out of this world dreamy it s very light and they do nt deep fry the whole veggie they actually julienne everything make it into little birds nest thingies then fry it they also add a clump of mashed daikon sprouts to the tempura so you can digest the oil better our server jenna was just awesome and gave us some great pointers on the more uncommon effects of sea urchin hooray for aphrodisiacs we also had this lobster roll thing with a sweet cream and tempura lobster so good the prices were really great i thought less pricey than stingray jew mom also gave it big thumbs up
this place is in my top thai places ive ever been to and ive been to many around the country i am obssessed with thai food since i was in grade school when i tried pad thai for the first time and i was hooked their panang curry is amazing and i always get it spicy the pad thai green and yellow currys are also delicious this place isnt fancy or expensive its perfect for take out or a casual lunch or dinner love it everyone should try it
one of the cleanest nicest well decorated restaurants i think it is specialized in steaks and since i am not steaks fan i went with the a burger i am glad i did it is one of the best burgers i had in my life specially with the wood fired bread lrb try the blt burger rrb i highly recommend this place
great friendly staff fantastic lunch specials and best ipa in town on tap sundays are great for families too kids eat free do nt miss the fig and prosciutto pie to die for
wow what a great place i was in town for business and stopped for dinner the pint is only for their microbrewed beer happy hour runs until pm or pm to close the atmosphere is great and the food was delicious as well i got the italian beef on beerbread and it is enough to feed two folks for i had their award winning th street and kilt lifter and it was great if you are unsure of what to get they offer the sampler for only all in all it is a great place to go whether you are inside or outside
i m new to the phoenix area and am anxious to check out all the places that people keep recommending to me thanks goodness dbg was high on the list i love it there and ca nt wait to go back i went on free day and it was crowded in the parking lot i was toting a stroller and month old so i was slightly concerned that it would be too crowded to enjoy thankfully that was not a problem at all with all the many trails and areas to explore there were times when  min would pass without seeing anyone else highlights included the butterfly tent oasis area and some weird little rodent with giant male parts wish i would have had time to stop and get a bite to eat  next time for sure i would also love to check out one of the evening events
i love two hippies can i say it enough  i really do and i swear i m not just biased i went to the burger joint and knew that i had to be level headed i loved the taco shop the breakfast joint and the organic pizza mm mm mm so i knew that i had to keep myself from liking this place simply for the name but oh oh oh oh so good i m not a big burger fan but i got the bacon cheese burger so good yum yum so like i said not a big burger fan so i was thinkin maybe i will just give this place a four just based on the fact that i simply love two hippies and maybe people would think i was lying but then i tasted their hot dog oh my the bacon who else did nt know that bacon could come in anything other than strips all waveylike  and it was huge oh and we ca nt forget the brown bag of frys so good i think they gave us an extra bag by mistake  i m not sure though we inhaled them too quickly to notice ding ding another winner for two hippies
best pho i ve ever had hands down i wo nt pretend to be a pho connoisseur but i do know good food when i taste it i ve only been here a handful of times but i ve noticed with every visit i crave it a little more thereafter in fact i m craving it now and it s only am i once heard that in vietnam they actually eat pho for brunch one of the greatest things about pho thanh is the build it yourself spring rolls it comes with a stack of rice paper a bowl of water for dipping a plate of meat and a massive mound of greens limes and vegetables throw it in roll it up and dip it in fish or soy sauce oh so good ca nt wait to go back
i have played this course two times now from the moment you pull up you feel like you are at a private course the staff is very friendly and professional the views are breathtaking and both times i have played the course has been in impecable shape the course is challenging but still enjoyable lots of holes that are down hill lrb great for long tee shots rrb this is one of my favorite courses in the area
here from los angeles looking for delicious organic local scottsdale best found it here the loving story of the chocolate pecan pie is a must hear
not sure how yelp works but i already posted a favorable review for this place but it has disappeared el pollo supremo is one is favorite places to eat the menu is simple but what they do with what they offer is unbelievable the chicken is outstandiing the beef succulent and the side perfect bring cash and enjoy what hey have to offer
i ve gone through of the lunch cards and i m still not sick of this pizza it s always good never had a bad slice sometimes at lunch everyone from the bank of america campus across the street will swarm the place then it takes forever other then that it s really quick
great place they really take the time to make sure you are happy before you leave they do not rush you out the door
this was a cool dive bar too bad we got there in time for only round before they closed fun crowd

you have to try this place the atmosphere is super cool but not pretentious and the service is amazing most of all the pizzas are creative fresh and delicious they also have an interesing lrb but expensive rrb cocktail list that i will try out next time i go the server we had knew so much about the food and was very passionate about the ingredients he even recommended different combinations we should try and was honest about what ingredients we probably should not combine lrb on a build your own pizza rrb the sweet corn pizza lrb sounds weird rrb was one of the most interesting things i have ever tasted it was my favorite i give it an a we also got the mushroom pizza with truffle oil lrb solid b  rrb and a build your own pizza with shrimp speck gorgonzola ricotta and maybe some other things that i ca nt remember but it was delicious the prcies are not too bad especially considering the atmosphere with a small gourmet pizza lrb enough to feed one person and leave you full rrb for around i really ca nt wait to go back and try more of the food next time i will plan to stay longer and enjoy the great atmosphere over cocktails
great food and fun atmosphere my family and i were even able to snap and take a wanted picture for bucks wish they had places like it at home
found a much wider selection of my favorite dressings here hi health only carries a few the fruit selection looked really fresh and great prices was happy to find many items on my list of eating healthier and trying to cut back on sugar added products so happy to have this place to shop
i liked this place the reviews show low stars but i liked it i was there for happy hour so go at that time the pricing is good i do nt know about dinner but happy hour is cool servers were chill host was a bit stuck up not sure why she though she was that great but the place is cool i recommend people check it out if they want to try a sushi place on the mill ave when you are in town visiting tempe
when i went to asu i went there when they first opened my freshman year and it was my favorite place to go eat for my years at asu the food is awesome totally awesome jay the owner realized that i seemed to visit a bit and made me work through the menu and it s all fantastic the chicken katsu is my personal favorite i can eat that all day if i could the bbq chicken and bbq mix are better than any other bbq around the valley as far as i am concerned and the loco moco is pretty legit since mai s got me started i try to check out other hawaiian restaurants when i get a chance to but mai s is still the best i miss it like crazy in the bay lrb can you believe az island food is better than what i can find here  rrb but next time i head back to az i know where i ll eat everyday

i had a leaky ac hose and squeaky belts bill replaced the belts had a new ac hose made flushed the system refilled it with the expensive good stuff r yet only charged me the price of the cheap stuff i suggested  a discount and now it blows cooold not bad for a year old vanagon in phoenix prior to finding these guys i had called a slew of other local vw shops and bill was one of the few willing to do ac work and clearly knowledgeable on the topic it was no surprise when i discovered that he has a syncro vanagon himself that wins the local bugoramas lrb the awards are on the wall rrb when the work was done he had me picked up  a mile round trip for their driver that s great service these guys will be my vanagon shop of choice in phoenix the reviews on httproadhauscomshopsphp and google maps echo my sentiments
wow creme de la creme i have been here various times and they have yet to meet my extraordinarily high standards highly recommend the infamous ooeygooey cupcakes i also love how forwardthinking tammie coe s is themeing out their delicious concoctions for the holidays
i m not sure i could say it better than donald s but scottsdale pen deserves a review and a favorable one at that i am a pen newbie i confess but as someone who has always appreciated a good disposable pen i am not sure why it has taken me this long to embrace the fountain pen however after years of corporate waste using cheap disposable pens i decided that i would finally purchase a refillable fountain pen this was the place to go the owner lrb  rrb was extremely helpful knowledgable and willing to spend the time to advise me towards a beautiful selection within my budget they had a wonderful selection from to  i finally settled on a pelikan and have never been happier it is a pleasure to write with it will last me many many years and i will never write with a disposable pen again i have a feeling that this is probably the start of collection and i look forward to shopping at scottsdale pen company even if my wife does nt look forward to me shopping there  rrb
this is one of the nicest theaters i have ever been to they have a large theater that shows the newest biggest movies this theater is called the cine  capri they also have great theater food you can choose from popcorn pretzels white castle burgers popcorn chicken churros and of course soda and candy i prefer the popcorn chicken you can purchase a loyalty cup for you diehard movie goers the loyalty cup is a oz drinking cup with cool movie designs on it you buy it once for and every time you come back you get as many refills you want for next if you buy a loyalty tshirt you can wear it and get a free large popcorn overall it s a great theater
great food and friendly service no matter how busy it gets love this place
the best steak salad i ve ever had love the fresh brewed beers too excellent menu with choices for everyone including gluten free every time i go to chandler for business i have to stop in at bj s at least twice

i know its annoying to all you az peeps when i say i grew up in ny with good food i accept that it is impossible for you to understand what it is like to rarely have bad bread bad cold cuts bad service or just plain have a place that is nt trying staying around of course us east coaster s are leaving out all the corporate places  the same chili s applebees boston market etc stores are back east as well lrb most of them rrb and they suck just as bad there as they do here what we mean is that the places that everyone goes to in our old neighborhoods are like defalco s defalco s is like no other place i have been to here in az they have amazing food great bread boar s head cold cuts and italian groceries that i did nt even realize i could nt find until i saw them here amazing just amazing they have chicken cutlets no one in az has these it is kind of ridiculous that an easy to make menu staple lrb in the east rrb is impossible to find out here i have seen them on menus they were actually chicken tenders cutlets are chicken breast breaded with italian spices and egg panfried and then baked defalco s has awesome cutlets they use them on their chicken parmesan sandwich as well that blew me away they also have dilusso genoa salami if you have nt had it you have nt had salami this gem of a store is a constant stop when i am anywhere near it or have family visiting if you have nt been just go side note if you are expecting to be told what is on the sandwich give up eating sandwiches when you order tell them the things you enjoy eating on bread they ll assemble it bring it to you and then you eat it it ai nt quiznos or subway this is good food if you ca nt figure it out walk away and eat crap come back when you know what you like

trekking through mud jumping over fire hurdling over cars and tires what better way to spend your sunday afternoon this was my first warrior dash event and it was awesome  of my classmates did the race and had a blast a friend and i dressed up in tiger costumes and by the end i lost my ears tail and sweated off my face paint it is one of my favorite events here at the end you can trade in the chip they give you lrb tracks your time rrb for a free beer they give you a free medal shirt and warrior hat all of which is awesome if you think you ca nt do it think again you ve got people of all ages and people in costume doing the race also at each station there s workers watching you in case of injury the only thing i d change about it is they need to make the after race a place for people to chill and hang out more more food stands would be a plus tip grab the groupon like we did only cost
i ve never been to liberty market for dinner though their dinner menu always looks amazing but i have enjoyed many a breakfastbrunchlunch there it is the type of restaurant where you place your order at a counter find a place to sit and then they bring your food to you they can get quite busy during peak meal times but they are efficient at finding open tables for you so you re never wandering around looking for a table after you ve ordered they are locallyowned and use a lot of fresh locally grown ingredients so that gives me a warm fuzzy feeling when i eat there pizzas salads and sandwiches are all delicious but what deserves an extra special shout out is the dessert case the gigantic cinnamon roll is perfection ca nt think of enough good things to say  just go check it out for yourself
jon shot my business photos over years ago he did such a wonderful and professional job that i am still getting referrals as a result of the head shot he chose i m planning to get updated shots done in
i had heard that they sold british bacon so i decided to stop by at first i thought they were closed because i did nt see any cars in the parking lot then i saw the entrance was over to the side and there were cars the store was nice and empty of customers the produce and food was displayed very nicely the store was clean and welcoming and yes they have english bacon yum yum and it s much cheaper than going to the british shop over on hayden and mcdowell self checkout was a breeze i would definitely come here again
work keeps me on the road and it took experiencing a lot of starbuckses to appreciate just how awesome my local one is this location has great staff plenty of tables and just the right vibe like calie mentioned in her review even the other patrons are great i can get a consistent cup of coffee at any location but if i m not running out the door with my joe this is the starbucks i want to be at
fabulous banana nutella crepe hard to find the real deal but this is it
our office just moved here from the bay area and my collegues and i have been on a mad search for a goodgreat chinese restaurant difficult to find until now nee house has high quality fresh ingredients and offers excellent flavors certainly on par with many bay area chinatown restaurants and yes the staff is a touch surly but that s a true indication that this is the authentic thing of course they re going to be surly it s a chinese restaurant excellent food ca nt wait to try the next treat tell all your friends we need to keep this place open
this place by far makes the best designer burgers i have ever had the delux buger with maytag bleu caramelized onions and arugula is orgasmic they have an unbelievable selection of delicious beer as well i ve had many meals and many late night meals there as they serve until am
i had only been to flemings once for their fabulous happy hour i decided to go for my birthday i ordered the wrong thing and they quickly turned what could have been a disappointing situation into a reason to come back nice atmosphere great service excellent food yes  a little pricey  but quality costs will be returning
two words jalepeno margarita just go trust me
i should one day try different dishes from here but i just ca nt pull myself away from the bang bang chicken  shrimp i about fainted after finding out how many calories are in this dish like many others on their menu but omg is it worth it huge portions that are good to the last bite always had good service not great service but i do nt come here for the service lol
this popular joint is my favorite pizza place in the asu vicinity nope not in asu itself but easily accessible from there especially by bike  which is a good mode of transportation to this restaurant because the parking lot is often full the servers are gracious and friendly and the pizza is very good i m not much of a pasta person so i have nt tried their pasta dishes yet be prepared for a bit of a wait during dinner although you can get seated faster if you opt to sit at the bar
such a fun place to go for brunch after a night of drinking in scottsdale obviously the bottomless mimosas and bloody mary s are the best deal in town and the food is fun and hearty enough to soak up all that alcohol our server mandy was fun spunky and literally never let our drinks get to half empty the place itself is very hip cool and modern western music is loud and fun overall a great place to go for the young and fun and more than deserving of the current stars
 the best
the great food sinful macaroons and friendly staff keep me coming back pumkin macaroon is my fave
yc s is just wonderful i have been going here for years  was so excited when they opened the germann location i recommend creating your own sauce  adding lots of their yummy tofu also  be sure to pile your noodles on very high
our group was in the mood for mexican food and i read the reviews on yelp and thought it was worth a try i made a reservation online and we arrived a little after on friday evening we were greeted by the hostess who asked what the th person in our party looked like so she could send him over when he arrived we were then greeted by our server ellen who was extremely friendly we ordered drinks and then chatted for awhile before ordering chips with salsas and a side of guacamole the pineapple salsa was extremely hot but ellen warned us about it so we had plenty of water on hand for dinner we ordered entrees to share so we could get the full culinary experience we ordered the quesadilla with portabello mushrooms and goat cheese lrb our favorite rrb shrimp fajitas and shrimp tostadas this was a lot of food for people and we ended up bringing part of the fajitas home my husband had the chimichanga and throughly enjoyed it we saw some of the desserts go by but refrained from trying one because we were so full i will definitely save room for dessert on my next visit which will be in the near future i would like to sit in the bar area next time because it looked fun
the food was great my burger was perfectly cooked and seasoned i had a side salad and the balsamic dressing was probably the best i ve ever tasted the wings were great moist crunchy and the sauce had a nice little kick to it our waitress was great she was very friendly made great recommendations and most importantly kept our drinks filled my only complaint was the decor as the name implies everything was blue the walls were all blue every other window was tinted blue so your food appeared to have a blue tint to it it was a little offputting they should rethink the blue and just have pops of blue with neutral walls and nontinted windows it would make the food more appealing to look at i still give it stars though
i have been back many times for maintenance a fit clothing spare tubes gels etc and have had a great experience every time the owner lrb or manager not sure rrb will go out of his way to make sure each customer is satisfied love them
there are a lot of reviews about this place that do not really sum it up look awesome fine dining it is not but it is a fun time for family and foodies just go in have a fun time and enjoy the menu and the bar i went here recently with my family and we were treated well and enjoyed the entertainment that they had as well this is a repeat place for us for sure we had the cheeseburger in paradise and it was tasty
we stopped in recently for a late evening dinner on the recommendation of a colleague thank you tim we loved it the food was fresh and delicious the staff were friendly and accommodating i left wishing i lived nearby and not hours away in san diego my final wrd on saigon kitchen is yummmm
holy goodness this was awesome tonight i had a dining experience so amazing that i ca nt even attempt to be hateful catty and mean about it blt steak is the best restaurant in the valley for realz the camelback inn is a beautiful property and blt steak fits right in the dining room and patio directly faces south on lincoln giving you a breathtaking view of camelback mountain this served as a great reminder that i will have to hike my fat ass up echo canyon about times to work off all the beef i m about to devour inspirational the bar has attentive service stiff drinks and serves complimentary olives nuts and pop corn with some wizardy spices sprinkled on top score  because i like to preeat before i sit down and eat lrb not being sarcastic rrb the servers are great  i think we had a separate food server and beverage attendant which was fancy and efficient  too things that rarely go hand in hand but the real highlight was the food i do nt even know where to begin i ll list everything i ate and describe it if i can bread with pate the only thing i did nt like but i m not a fan of liver not their fault moving on fresh popovers with euro butter the second best bread experience of my life second only to the giant bread cart at le louis xv alain ducasse s restaurant in monaco lrb an epic journey in dining and a must visit for anyone who lives to eat rrb hamachi the freshest buttery yellow tail that ever lived  or lived than died whatever  it was dope shrimp cocktail holla chopped salad this was pretty good  but more like a greek salad hybrid i d skip it in favor of the buffalo mozzarella salad jackpot cheese so soft it melted fresh yellow tomatoes great dressing etc filet the best filet i ve had in arizona dethroning maestros and donovan s for sure ahi tuna rare plump buttery holy shit glazed carrots i m obsessed with carrots particularly cooked ones and i do nt know why these carrots were off the hook and i almost ate the whole a la carte bowl hash browns the fact that the hashies came in huge hunks of hash brown pie was pretty awesome and ridiculous pecan pie dope and icecreamy fruit crepe i was nt a fan  too passion fruity for me but my dining partners dug it random complimentary dessert cookies a nice surprise sauces holy fing crap  they offer all these random sauces like peppercorn sauce horseradish and a mustard trio order them all even though they are each totally worth it i really liked this entire experience i left fat and stuffed and happy  and did nt even feel sick or like i had to run  not walk  to the bathroom immediately after similar dining experiences at steakhouses make me dash for the loo i know  gross but you know it happens to you too blt steak e bitches seriously
wow i had a groupon that was expiring so my husband and i went last night i had heard great things about it but great really does nt even begin to describe the emotions that i went through last night love the atmosphere really love the cool chandeliers benches menus all of it really i tried the death s door cocktail lrb i am a vodka drinker rrb loved it and it was gin then on to the tasting menu i frankly adore tasting menus because of the small portions and you could to try the best of the best amuse was a little green bean salad lrb wanted more rrb chilled corn soup lrb omg smooth vibrant rrb carbonara lrb my idea of the perfect pasta dish fresh pasta fresh tomato sauce basil cheese rrb i could eat this everyday then the scallops came perfectly charred delightfully sweet done perfectly i do nt think i have ever had a scallop done that well before let the whimsy begin after the incredible courses we had already experienced then came the cotton candy what a fun way to remember your childhood oh did i mention the doughnuts not only where they piping hot but came with delish dipping sauces what else can i say we love love loved it the food was spot on as well as the service this is a definite repeat performance thanks noca
i have been going to tempe tuneup literally since i was in the womb my parents has taken all of their cars and now my sister and i take our cars to gary at tempe tuneup  never anybody else i ve been spoiled with gary all my life and never even knew that mechanics could be dishonest manipulative or cheats i am moving out of state soon and to be honest one of the things i will miss most is having a mechanic like gary that i can trust like a family member to care about the quality of my car  it just makes life a little less stressful also susie the office managerreceptionist has been with tempe tuneup since i can remember  at least years i m sure and is also super helpful and friendly and i believe the fact that she s been there for that long says a lot about how the business runs we all know what it feels like to be treated with respect and to interact with people who have genuine integrity and when you go to a mechanic you should be able to expect those qualities from the people who you re trusting to leave your car with  tempe tuneup is that place
so far so good taco tuesday s are awesome cant beat that i would definitely eat here again
we tried ohso for dinner tonight and could not have been happier with the food beer and service for happy hour you get babypitchers of local brews  good stuff my wife lrb a vegetarian rrb had the mediterranean salad sans meat and loved it i had one of the chicken flatbreads and it was delicious i d like to try almost everything on the menu the beer list is unique and unmatched from what i ve seen so far in the valley service was outstanding give it a shot i hope this place sticks around because we will be back often
my wife and i dined at cork on march and this time it was for year anniversary i called earlier in the week to make a reservation and informed them it was our anniversary when we arrived we were greeted by a friendly hostess who sat us right away when we sat down they presented a menu to us that said happy st anniversary jason  meg such a great personal touch for an app we ordered the lion paw scallop  braised short rib with polenta fry and wilted spinach we also ordered salads i had the baby iceberg lettuce salad she had the organic green salad that has spiced caramel popcorn on top for dinner she had the buttermilk fried chicken and i had the grilled organic oregon lamb chop the plates are small portions and just enough for a single person without feeling stuffed i would not hesitate to recommend anyone cork their service and friendliness are top notch please try a local non chain restaurant like cork in chandler you will be surprised and delighted
my stylist is fantastic been coming here for years would follow her anywhere the salon is pretty they always have little yummies to nosh on staff is quite pleasant too
i highly recommend this place everyone was so helpful and friendly i honestly ca nt wait to go back
they are closed and i am sad wonderful restaurant first rate customer service and food was the best
this place is great i love the atmosphere and it has a great mix of people they have a pretty good beer selection i was sad that i only stayed for a few drinks i am definitely coming back here to try the absinthe cocktail love when they put absinthe in drinks
my favorite coffee shop in phx their espresso is incredible great midcentury decor friendly staff great music a way better cup of coffee then you ll find at lux my only complaint is that they close on sunday really early they need to extend their hours this place is still one of my favorite coffee spots in phoenix and i highly recommend it
i love this gym everyone is so helpful and friendly the gym has a ton of equipment and is always very well kept and clean i would nt want to go anywhere else i feel very well connected to all of the staff  they even know me by name the trainers are extremely helpful also i would recommend this gym to anyone and everyone
what a cool little accident what started out as a trip to find the roosevelt turned into an impromptu journey into the living room of some random guy check that some random guy who just happens to really like to drink i ca nt emphasize this point enough this is not the type of bar i m used to seeing it s an old retrofitted house the bar is what used to be the kitchen your table lrb or standing area if you go when it s busy rrb is in what used to be the living room lrb or fronchroom if you re a fellow chicagoan rrb i liked the design on the inside hardwood floors exposed beams art on the walls very low light  very  low light i had to hold the beer menu a few inches from my face before i could decide what to order however a bar should nt be bright throw on some good tunes on sirius underground garage and you ve got yourself a mood on to the beer huge list of microbrews many from the area and a ton from oregon i went with the monk madness rogue in a oz bottle  apv of tastiness i liked the hoppy bite at the end my fellow drinker did not that s the great thing about this place though there are so many different beers to explore let s review  intimate place  conducive to good conversation  great beer list lrb also have a good wine list including sake rrb  no k millionaires stars rounded up
absolutely fantastic massage not your run of the mill massage at all i truly felt better after leaving and it was nt just a state of relaxation i felt like doing yoga and moving around and taking care of my body a bit better than i had been doing before
i highly recommend addison taylor fine jewelry the prices are fair and the quality can not be surpassed scott takes the time to get to know you as an individual so that the jewelry he creates is as individual as you are
they have cinemasuites and fork and screen i was so skeptical the first time someone told me a dinner theater could actually be a pleasant experience since usually you go and it s noisy and the food is nt as good as it could be elsewhere and movie theater food is always suspicious anyways but amc actually trained their employees to serve food during a movie without being intrusive and i ve seen three or four movies with dinner and drinks now and had a great time every time the food is actually good regular movie tickets cost enough anyway you might as well make a night of it and have dinner and drinks all at the same place speaking of drinks they do nt skimp on the booze either
love this place first big props to mr johnston for renovating an old lrb for gilbert rrb buidling instead of doing a teardown which is more common in the valley my architect cousin was seriously impressed with the structure i remember liberty market when it was a ghetto liquor store that sold some decent chorizo it s wonderful to have this space turned into a great restaurant where you can meet up with friends for breakfast lunch or dinner breakfast is yummy i always get the veggie scramble being a vegetarian it s loaded with goat cheese so what s not to love  biscuits cinnamon buns and sticky buns are fantastic for lunch and dinner i stick with the caprese salad or sandwich their thin crust pizza is very good but the caprese is exceptional so it s hard to venture from it i ve had this dish all over town and while some places may have better bread lrb pane bianco rrb the actual fillings are so much better at liberty market the other item i have a hard time straying from is the sweet potato salad it s unreal no mayo here instead it s tossed with chipotle lrb i think rrb flavored oil craisins and pecans on a side note i would love it if liberty would over some veggie meat option a la capriotti s so that i could try their other sandwiches desserts all kick ass i ve had the red velvet and carrot cakes here both some of the best i ve had if you re only going to get one dessert make it the bread pudding a friend of mine who lived in france for two years said it was the best in the world it totally is it s a great value two considering you can share it among  adults if you come here for nothing else you must have some coffee as a coffee drinker it would be an abomination for me to visit liberty and not get something from the e bar the last time i went i got an iced latte and i was actually mad because it was  so  good mad as in why is nt all espresso this good  and why do nt i drink this every day  
i am on run of local reviews here and i want to end it on my all time favorite food pasta i discovered this local gem at the phoenix farmer s market about a month ago and have enjoyed it ever since i love to cook pasta dishes and have been known to try my hand at making pasta with varying degrees of success well these guys make me look pathetic their pasta is dried and cooks up in a scant  minutes the variety of flavors is outrageous spinach mushroom garlic roasted tomato and so on these pastas are what i would call standalones you literally need to add nothing to eat for consumption maybe some nice local olive oil lrb mad props to queen creek olive mill rrb and some shavings of parm and you are golden i would almost chug the remaining pasta water if it was nt so damn hot love the pasta and love the fact that it s local people go local
i was reluctant to go to the kierland area this past weekend because i knew my wallet would take a beating but my wife had a gift certificate and wanted to explore the kierland area shops and restaurants we made reservations for on the patio we waited for about minutes for our table to be cleaned and were escorted to our table on the patio talk about living large a patio overlooking the shops and the courtyard which was accented with a bunch of palm trees on a beautiful degree day the ambiance alone rates an extra star we started off with the trio for which is pieces of bread lrb which was refilled rrb and with generous amounts of hummus an olive spread and goat cheese all spreads were delicious my favorite was the goat cheese wow my first time to eat goat cheese and i am definitely hooked we lucked out an had a great server i believe her name was bree kudos bree bree helped us with the menu items my son had the chicken parmasean and did nt share any with me so i m thinking that was really good and i should order some next time my wife went out of her comfort zone and ordered the buccatini which is short ribs and spaghetti win i ordered the flank steak which was topped with fresh arugula greens the steak was fabulous they serve you what seems to be two steaks that are cut in strips plenty of food i had a hard time finishing off the steak since it was so much we then relaxed and had a great post meal family conversation all and all a very enjoyable evening out for lrb no alcohol rrb before tip and gift card
this place is amazing i came here with my brown boy as he is so affectionately called to grab a quick bite to eat after classes still not sure why the boy invited me out to lunch if he was nt hungry but i was starving so i was down i ended up getting the something kafta and he got the spanakopita the food arrived promptly and the kafta was huge it came with two huge pieces of ground lamb hummus garlic sauce and pita the spanakopita was also a huge for an appetizer i did nt have any of the spanakopita because i was so busy enjoying my meal the lamb was perfectly seasoned and was a great match for the addicting garlic sauce and the hummus walked out of here paying less than definitely a great meal at an amazing price i can see why it s packed with college students if you are getting dessert i would skip over the jellied treats and go for the baklava nothing can beat baklava
this is a cute place the live music on monday nights is like a throw back to the s and s lrb in a good way rrb the guitar duo plays dave matthews counting crows etc for food we ordered the portobello mushroom burger lrb nice and fresh rrb the spring rolls lrb again fresh and tasty rrb ahi cups lrb looked impressive  a good sized portion arrived but i did nt try any because raw fish makes me sad rrb lastly the sweet potato tots make me want to nom nom nom all night long oh and our drinks were awesome lrb generous and half priced rrb service was busy lrb on monday nights there is a special rrb so the place was understandably busy but our waitress was super friendly and what bumped this place to five stars was the manager he was helpful accommodating all around a great guy and what a manager should be yes he is da bomb that made me want to write this com review definitely worth a gander especially on a monday
amazing i visited my friend in scottsdale over the weekend and she took me here now i m craving it hope to return in the near future such unique fresh flavors also the owner is super awesome  friendly
so good the restaurant does not look like much when you first walk in but the food definitely makes up for it we had the hard apple cider pot roast and the seared scallop picatta both got rave reviews although we could have skipped dinner altogether and filled up on the bread and oil served before the meal the waitstaff was friendly and attentive but not overbearing the atmosphere was warm and inviting and unlike grumpy mike s below i love the fact that they allow pets on  pf the patio
crescent ballroom is a huge success for downtown phoenix the setup is surely to be copied lrb hopefully rrb by other arizona venues the bar makes real cocktails and is affordable the mexican streetstyle food is delicious and decent quantities the venue looks nice where it counts and keeps it minimal for a good show room the size of the entire venue keeps things intimate but has enough room not to be unrealistic like a lot of places in downtown phx the sound from the few shows i have been to have all been well done
there s probably not a lot that can be said about texaz grill that has nt been said but i feel the need to put in a good word for their catfish it s great  perfectly battered flaky great flavor and the two massive fillets are enough to share with a friend making it a fairly inexpensive reasonably healthful dinner for two
this is truly a hidden gem in the valley it looks like a small little shop from the outside but when you enter you re greeted by the amazing smell of coffee and much much more room then you couldve ever imagined the coffee itself is amazing and the staff is awesome i ll never go to starbucks again
kick  the best of the bertos  they will make anything you want  carne asada with sausage  ham wow
brad is the best our windows and screens are sparkling clean he is what every contractor should be professional courteous friendly punctual etc his prices are extremely reasonable and he does a great job i would highly recommend him we have used him for the past couple of years and have always been extremely satisfied in addition brad is just all around good guy very friendly super nice and a kind soul
we met my uncle and aunt here after meeting at the hotel indigo across the lot we sat at one of their comfortable roomy booths and had some cold ones i had a couple cores lites and was satisfied i can not comment on the food as i did nt have any as i was full from lunch at the silver spur lrb see my review  rrb but it smelled wonderful they have half off appetizers and beers during happy hour the small padio outside is perfect for a warm scottsdale day our server michael was very friendly and knowledgeable i enjoyed the classic rock and soft rock they had playing this restaurantlounge has a cult following and it is easy to see why so for good drinks at reasonable prices with friendly service in a casual atmosphere the lodge can not be beat keep up the good work guys
i love the sushi here i ve eaten here many times and i ve never had a bad roll their rolls are large compared to local restaurants  always a plus drink menu is soso decor is fun orange can be a tad too much sometimes i love sitting outside and people watching a definite stop if you re in the area
i love that the menu is small and limited  it s not hard to choose i had the lamb sandwich and it was the best lamb i have ever tasted i loved everything about it the cheese complimented the meat to perfection and what can i say about the wine list excellent meat and wine the keys to my heart i will definitely be back again and again
as a local living in this area  this is the place to go always great company to be found there and great service holly and josh are awesome best day drinking little hideway in all of old town
since i moved to az from ca i have tried several vietnamese places and until now was eating only at pho dalat i recently relocated near mcc so i decided to try pho ao sen and boy am i glad i did their food is fantastic  the meats being much higher quality than most local competitors i ve tried three of the rolls from the appetizer menu the pho ga and two different bun dishes all were excellent the atmosphere is very nice the service can be a bit slow like most asian restaurants the only thing lacking imho is a liquor license  i likey my beer with my pho
great instructors very friendly especially to newcomers great first experience  signed up for more sessions they are friendly encouraging and it s a great place to get your yoga on
i love this place it first caught my eye driving to work their logo includes a shazzam lighting bolt which is rad if your into comics i went in the place and they had comic art on the walls the staff made some suggestions of what i should try i got the slider pizza  lrb kinda like a cheese burger pizza rrb they actually used a little brown mustard on top anyway it was delicious i ca nt get over the helpful staff though it is very rare that i get that kind of service at a pizza joint any way every time i have visited the place there has been no patrons and it breaks my heart because that is a good sign that it is nt going to be around long if you get the change please check this place out
just ate at aunt chilada s and it was very tasty some people commented that they did nt like the noodles lrb fideo rrb with the beans but that was my favorite part i did nt really care for them alone but mixed in with the beans it was delicious i ordered number lrb cheese enchilada  green corn tamale rrb which was good albeit pretty standard and my mom got the chicken tortilla soup which she said she would definitely get again and i d have to agree with the other yelpers  the chips and salsa are fantastic
my son has been attending child care here for just over a year it was a challenge to watch my son go from not want to go to child care to eventually not wanting to come home lol the staff at tots are friendly and knowledgeable they treat all the kids as if they were their own the best thing about tots is their flexible payments you are able to pay daily instead of having to pay by the week or month much mahalo for taking care of my maikalani o pua
honeycomb shochu  with the big crystal clear ice cube drool
one of my all time favorite chinese restaurants and once which i used to frequent with great regularity when i worked in the area now that i ve moved further north in the valley i miss it dearly but still sporadically get the chance to stop in and not one single disappointment in all the time i ve been going there the ambiance is something unique as it looks like a big banquet hall not so much like a restaurant and certainly not what you expect for a typical chinese place it s pretty cool that they have the back wall covered in aquariums where you can see the live fish that much is probably worth the trip if you ve never been there is a feeling that you re somehow stuck in a s hotel ball room but in some strange way it almost feels nostalgic more than it turns you off to the place maybe that s just me but it s kind of cool i ve only ever really sampled from the dim sum but as stated i ve never been disappointed the food quality is always top notch and the selection is usually quite good the lotus wrapped rice is one of my favorites and it s not a real dim sum lunch at great wall unless you try this stuff while not a fan personally my asian companions have always raved about the chicken feet they taste great it s just not my thing the bean curd and pork dishes have always been fantastic and their several varying dim sum offerings with shrimp are consistently fresh and absolutely delicious it should go along way to say that as many times as i ve been here i have never once had a bad food experience either during or after my visits nor has anyone i ve gone with another thing the do very well here is the tea it is always a perfect match for the dim sum and works great to clear the pallet and balance out the flavor in the food my friends and i could spend over an hour just nibbling at our dim sum sipping tea and enjoying the time away from the office which is exactly what work week lunch at a good dim sum place is all about if you have nt had the experience i highly recommend checking this place out just be aware that they sometimes get packed especially on the weekend and for late lunch during the week so go early and avoid the weekends if possible dim sum is highly recommended and do nt forget to try the hot tea
i joined a meetup group that was meeting here and while that did nt go so well i had a great time at down under i arrived late and it appeared everyone from the group was already together and there were no other seats so i took a spot at the bar and enjoyed the tasting alone the tasting was and included wines plus an appetizer i went with the mini kangaroo loin salad because let s face it how often do you get to eat a kangaroo  the salad was very good and i enjoyed all of the wines the white y viognier was my favorite until i tried the mgs lrb although i did nt have a bad one in the bunch rrb the evening turned out well as one of my friends stopped by for a few minutes and i was able to strike up a nice conversation at the bar with another lady the restaurant was busy and there was a singer that helped pack in the customers she was very good  not too loud good tunes and a nice voice as it approached  i noticed more and more people leaving i asked one of the guys what time they closed and he said whenever the last paying customer leaves they do not have set times to close because as long as people are having a good time and still buying things they will stay open i met phil the owner and he was an excellent host i always saw susana check in here but never tried it i am glad that i went out today and met some people even if it was nt the people i was supposed to meet i will definitely come back maybe next time i will try the emu wings  and i saw someone get an incredible looking huge piece of chocolate cake  i must try that
i ve been wanting to try this place for a while now but because of their hours it did nt work out until just last week let me tell ya it was worth the wait they are only open from  msat and i wish they were open normal business hours because i would probably eat there for dinner all the time they have a great menu of sandwiches salads wraps etc i had the stragefolk sandwich lrb maple glazed turkey spicy country mustard muenster cheese shaved carrots red onions and a heaping mound of homemade coleslaw on grain bread rrb it was a large portion with a side included and it was less than the meat was really good  freshly sliced while i waited the bread was great  they also sell it by the loaf the ingredients all seemed very fresh and healthy the owner mentioned that they try to use organic and fresh ingredients to keep things on the healthy side and i really could taste the difference while we were eating the gentleman that was working brought us a sample of the lobster bisque soup it was to die for with large chunks of fresh lobster he said they only serve it the last friday of each month because it is so expensive to make and with their reasonable prices it ends up being almost a wash he also brought us each a piece of a peanut butter cookie omg delish needless to say i will definitely be eating here again
very cool secret sunday free drinks lrb wine or mojito rrb bruschetta salad pizza and olives friend them on facebook for a chance too be on their first list
penzey s is a really cool place i would have never went if it had nt of been for my friend who happens to love cooking he took me along with him and made me realize just how important good spices are and at penzey s spices they have every spice known to man and they re all set out so that you can smell them before buying the prices are really good and the staff is super helpful almost a little overly if you want to update your spice rack this is the place to do it at it will cost you almost as much as it would at the grocery store and you ll get higher quality spices than you would otherwise
if you do drive it you can make it all the way to mcdowell coming down wo hitting the gas once at night silent sundays they shut the road down to cars so bring your skateboardbikeradio flyer wagon and roll it bring water i never unserstood how people live in the desert and then end up stuck on a mountain dehydrated with heat stroke news flash its hot and dry here come prepared this mountain has probably the best views of the city and some really cool trails if you are gonna drive it make sure to fill your tank up because while it takes nothing to get down it youll go thru a half tank getting up it rrb
winco is a great grocery store i can get almost everything i need there this place gets a bad rap and i do nt know why here s their angle they do nt take credit cards lrb but debit is ok and it says so on the door rrb and they do nt hire people to bag lrb you just do it yourself rrb then they take the savings and make their prices lower and i do nt see anything wrong with that i do nt know what they pay their employees but they certainly do nt seem to be the soulless braindead wagehostages you see at your average walmart there s no pharmacy though and their vitaminsupplement selection is kind of weak so there s still a need for me to go to frys once in a while but they have awesome stuff there tons of things you can but in bulk by the pound lrb candy rice dog food snacks nuts coffee honey peanut butter and more rrb we re going on a camping trip soon and we found packs of hotdogs for like cents campingsize tanks of propane for about bucks giant marshmallows and ft wooden skewers for them all on the cheap i got a pack of offbrand hour energy for like there last time too and they are just as good and the premade pizza crusts amazing deal i really like this place of course it s busy because the prices are so good so go late they are open hrs for a reason haters gonna hate
i look forward to work trips that take us to phoenix and cibo is the one restaurant that we never miss the restaurant feels like home the wait staff is generous but most importantly the quality of the food is amazing we were there last friday for dinner and ate on the patio with our daughter lrb very family friendly rrb the weather was perfect we started out with the burrata then amazing pizza as the main course compliments to the chef ca nt wait to come back to cibo
my husband and i have been here twice in the last week for dinner it is a bit pricey as other reviewers have said lrb around for dinner entrees rrb but for vegetarian and organic food what exactly do folks expect  you get what you pay for we were happily surprised after reading the reviews the food was amazing the portions are huge and we had leftovers both times lrb and ps we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble despite the review about only paying cash rrb our first visit we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered my husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish for an appetizer we had the sabzi which is a huge plate of green herbs homemade wheat nan feta cheese and walnuts the herbs were fresh and the nan was delicious just the smell of it was enough to get us drooling for entrees we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant i am currently pregnant and garlic is not something that s agreeing with me i asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said we can make it however you want every dish is made when you order it what  the dishes are made to order  i have nt heard that at a lot of restaurants after about minutes our stews arrived steaming hot and smelling delicious they were heavenly so many flavors and so fresh our second time here we had the dolmeh plate and mast va mosear lrb a spinach dip rrb both were ok but i like the sabzi better the entrees we had were amazing i had a special of the day lrb pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu which was blissful to smell and eat rrb and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix overall if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice organic foods dinner go here and check it out everything will be fresh everything will smell and taste delicious and the restaurant s atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed decadent evening
i pledge allegiance to the sweet republic and the deliciousness for which it stands one location with so many flavors with something amazing and incredible for all i can not say enough good things about sweet republic how sweet it is i do nt think you can go wrong here if corn flavored ice cream is one of the best things i ever tasted how can one go wrong  whatever helen one of the owners and the genius behind the incredible array of flavors tells me to put in my mouth i will from the traditional vanilla bean to the unconventional corn flavor there is definitely something for everyone the ingredients are top of the line and it comes through in the flavors all the ice cream is made on the spot the decor is cool welldesigned comfortable friendly and ecofriendly wherever possible the service is great the staff is nice so do nt hesitate the ice cream here is not only full of wonderful flavor but it is a wonderful experience as well
very small place but very cozy when it s busy it s tough to find a place to plant myself one time on a first friday night they opened up the backyard and was serving brews there and lots of open space there s occasionally bands playing there love the fact that they serve delirium very glad to have found the lost leaf
i have been to a downtown historic glendale several times and ca nt believe i have never been in this little darling a girlfriend and i came to the area for the sidewalk sale but did nt really make it since we spent most of our time in this shop pink house had a great mix of new and used clothes for women with some sections for kids men and some household items while i thought some of the clothes were on the pricier end there were a large number of affordable items there were also a ton of things i found adorable and stylish this is one of those places that you will always find something new and different although the clothing is what drew me in i left with a couple of necklaces a bracelet and ring they had this great shelf with beaded rings for ca nt beat that this is one of those places that can appeal to a diverse crowd it has clothes that are flirtyfeminine vintagethrift store finds the retros look along with gift items lrb stationary reusable bags jewelry etc rrb i can not wait to go back when i have more time such a cute shop
while my mate was backing the golf cart out of the garage he did not notice the door had not fully opened hit bumped the door and dislodged two of the rollers so i called avondale garage doors they asked if tomorrow will work for us they then asked where we lived after telling them he said our community gets priority service they will do it now why we get such service i have no idea but who am i to argue they were here with in twenty three minutes and just left and the door is as it should be cool huh
classic sushi gotta love it staff very nice and helpfull easy to make friends
ah miracle mile i will always love you i grew up in phoenix during the s and s offspring of parents who had grown up on the east coast and knew what a real deli was supposed to taste like and smell like and at that point in phoenix history mm was the only game in town for that kind of experience probably still is anyway we ate at the old park central location hundreds lrb okay maybe just dozens and dozens rrb of times sampling everything on the menu  the pastrami is still my favorite though i can even remember when they expanded and built out that back patio with the koi pond which quickly became my favorite place to sit when i went there with my mom the christown location was okay too but it did nt have the koi pond so it was nt as interesting to me and the guys who worked behind the counter what a bunch of old pros if you went there during lunch rush you had better know what you wanted when you reached the counter lrb and since you d probably been staring at the menu for five minutes you had no excuse not to rrb or you d get sent to the back of the line i was sad to hear that park central location was gone a little piece of my childhood being closed off but this location at the colonnade it s not bad and the pastrami is every bit as delicious as i remember from years past i ca nt wait until the next time i m in phoenix to visit my mom so we can go there again
so so good i love the hummus the falafel the dolmades mmmmmm mmmmmm mmmmmmmm i also love how they always let me make up what i want on my plate and bring it out to me so i always get my favorites
it s been almost a year since my last review and thought it was time to share an update with my fellow yelpers  rrb       smoky goodness alert         be prepared to smell smoky goodness upon entry of pork on a fork it is highly addictive in intoxicating so dinners beware pork on a fork has the best pulled pork sandwich in phoenix and maybe even the best in the entire universe sure their might be a few other places that have better bbq ribs brisket andor smoked sausages but pork on a fork is as good or better than most at these and the are the best at pulled pork you can not beat their pulled pork sandwich which is humongous  almost enough for two people it s so moist tender and with a nice aroma of smokiness you ll want it for for yourself it comes with two sides i recommend their tasty seasoned waffle fries and their bbq beans these bbq beans are cooked in heaven  sent by angels down to earth and given to pork on a fork to sell to their customers  rrb well maybe that s a stretch but their bbq beans are soooo tasty full of bacon and brisket burnt ends with a great balance of seasoning if you have tried pork on the fork yet you do nt know what you re missing once you ve tried them for lunch you ll find yourself wanting more and caa nt wait for your next visit i hope to see you there
best deli in town best sushi bar and best brownies also had great kale salad from the deli and drum roll this store has a wine bar in it also
i have been to several ra locations and in my opinion this one is the best probably have ate  drank here or times in the last years i hands down love this place do nt know how anybody could not give it stars the sushi has always been great we have never had a bad piece of sushi here  in fact my wife and i consider it to be kind of the standard by which we measure other places that serve sushi yes the kirin sake bombers are always on special but i like asahi better than kirin and they have both so i m in good shape additionally the female employees are generally pretty attractive at this place which makes it easier to sit and hang out for extended periods of time and there are usually a couple of dude bartenders that my wife can stare at a little so she s placated the crowd is usally pretty good thursday friday  saturday nights the club music type atmosphere is current relevant and helps keep you in high spirits finally since the theater is right next door you can people watch from the patio pretty easily pricing is what you would expect for a place of this caliber and atmosphere highly recommend
i m giving this place a because it s one of the best burgers i ve had in phoenix the real score is somewhere between a and a though i truly dig the burger they clearly use quality meats  in fact they advertise this the fries here are fantastic as well we grabbed this togo and the fries were still crispy and perfect they do nt have beer quite yet i do nt think but they will in a few weeks they do have a really cool assortment of soda bottles though i like the concept and the execution i m glad this is near my house the owner and the staff are cool and i hope this restaurant succeeds
went there this evening for supper what a treat what a delight service was good was reluctant to go based on what others said about the waitress but ours rachael was a delight the other waitress seemed quite nice albeit a bit reserved i had a bianco s pizza which was worth stars by itself my wife had a pasta dish with vodka as a sauce base it was also excellent but i m getting ahead of myself first the decor is very very nice there was live piano music with a blond singer quite nice and then warm bread with a spread of something that contained pimento s i think very good then the dinner wow you can bet we ll be back again
i brought my mom to the phoenician s spa for her brithday in march and we could nt have enjoyed it more we hung around the pool all afternoon then enjoyed treatments i did the reflexology which was very relaxing my mom enjoyed her massage also the entire experience was very nice but as we did nt acutally stay there i have nothing to say about the rooms if they were taken care of as well as the grounds this would be a wonderful hotel to stay
best sushi in phoenix and you would totally miss it if you were nt looking extremely creative rolls and fantastic quality sashimi we will be back
favorite pho in the phoenix area so far great tender meat in my pho chin nam lrb  rrb i see they also have bun bo hue on the menu so i ll have to try that sometime soon nom nom friendly staff see ya there

truly excellent new mexico cuisine the carne adovada was insanely good as was the portobello mushroom enchildas my husband had the ribs and they were outstanding this place was so good we went back again the next night and do nt miss their crme brle

i am always looking for an authentic mexican cuisine experience and this place is up there with the best some of the best salsas i ve ever had the  chile salsa is amazing if you like a little heat in your life
i feel very fortunate that i live across the street from this ahwatukee pizza bistro they make wonderful pies i take out from here once a week the waitrons are attentive and the pizza is ready in minutes i recommend the hawaiian lrb ham pepperoni and pineapple rrb the flaumbay lrb pepperoni green bell peppers garlic and pineapple rrb or the raspotle lrb chicken roasted red bell peppers raspberry chipotle sauce and a choice of feta or goat cheeseno mozzarella cheese rrb the crust is thin but sweet and chewy they make a wonderful tomato sauce that adds to the taste of the fresh veggies and meat
this restaurant while quaint and non descript serves really fresh and delicious uzbek food the kabobs are amazing especially lula kabob the chicken is super tender and flavorful service is good as well five all around
great service great martinis and always great pieces and rolls
its my favorite thai place in tempe sometimes there is a wait but its always worth it my favorite is the siamese basil chicken
not your typical flashy scottsdale hang out sounds good to me i like the old school interior it is kinda comforting in some sort of historic way the food however is to write home about for being in the middle of the desert their seafood in phenominal king crab and the mussles are my favorite happy dining
favorite wine bar by far more for the food of course bruchetta is the best you will ever find it s more of a french bread with toppings not super crunchy a tad chewy the prosciutto cheese and fig is my favorite this is a wonderful date spot and is perfectly lit for a romantic evening maybe a tad loud and the wait may be long but worth it check this place out there is one being built on gilbert rd in old town gilbert so no more long drives to my favorite spot
go to this place tucked away in a little residentialesque building angels trumpet ale house is the coolest new place in roro to grab some brews i went here with my older brother on a friday after work and the place was popping strolled through the door lrb whose handle is an entire broomstick wicked cool looking rrb and grabbed a table by the big bay windows over looking the patio not quite full yet but within minutes the place was full and the patio was too people really like this place the beer was good i got a cider and it was very tasty we were nt that hungry so we split the meat treat pizza and it was bomb the bacon was nice and crunchy and the veggies were nt slimy or overwhleming like they tend to be on flat bread pizza i can not wait to go back here especially this fall when the patio lrb which overlooks dowtown phx rrb is nice and cool and enjoy plenty o drinks
alright this is the deal of deals for students and im not sure if its a quarter more or not but less dollars half an ice cream cookie sandwiches trust me its enough its a great pick me up for something sweet on mill cookies are made their along with the good ice cream and if your not into that they have italian ice place is small but is packed with flavor and smells like fresh cookies recommendation if you love cookies made into sandwiches
the roaring fork restaurant is a fantastic place to relax and unwind from a hard days work and there is no need to rush to enjoy happy hour it goes on all night in the saloon everyday of the week from to pm
i have lived in az for five years now and can not believe i have never heard of this place it must be because it is on the opposite side of town anyway it is absolutely to die for i tasted several of the petite pastries and got to learn all about their business their wedding cakes are unbelievable and they only use the freshest ingredients i will buy all of my special occation cakes for honeymoon sweets from now on sooooooooo good
one of the best around
wow you should try the gel manicures that they offer here they are about which seems expensive for just a manicure but they seriously last for weeks without chipping and they look really shiny the gels are made by opi and come in a range of their most popular lacquers i have had people do them here now and i will never get a regular manicure ever again
apparently yumminess is in the mouth of the beholder i love caketini and make a point to stop by every time i am at the mall i keep reading other posts comparing them to sprinkles me personally i dont like sprinkles i think that they are small chinzy on frosting dry and overpriced caketini on the other hand has large soft cupcakes with lots of great frosting which is not a buttercream or a whipped its kind of in between so its not too sweet but very light my favorites are the salted caramel and the coconut the caramel cupcake has just enough salt that you get a little crunch i would say to try it for yourself and make up your own mind by the way there are locations at the mall a kiosk by hm and an actual store upstairs by the entrance to nordy s
hoooolllllly cripes on a popsicle stick ever eat a fullcourse meal and then want to start all over again because it was just that damned good  this place is a home run in every sense not just a regular home run but one of the ones where the ball shatters the stadium lights and robert redford is running the bases with sparks falling everywhere i honestly do nt even remember every bit of what was consumed it was a blur of pure delight there were these delicious peppers in cream sauce and tomatoes with goat cheese for appetizers oh man i could ve eaten those until the act was criminalized at some point corn on the cob with parmesan appeared then entrees came i had the halibut lrb yes you can get insanely fresh seafood in phoenix it s a myth that you can not rrb it was so perfect and firm and tasteful others got the lamb and it was sinful you have to literally find a wooden booth and go to confession after eating it i m available for light penance if you ca nt find willing clergy anyway the desserts i m not a dessertordering person but we got puddings and cakes and i wanted them all in my mouth immediately now we polished everything off and i seriously wanted the menu back so i could start again the drinks the drinks were off the hook we tried ordering mint juleps but the bartender had other things in mind he had invented a variation on the mint julep and would we care to try it  of course we would oh it was game on so tasty also the ambiance here is just killer the kitchen is right there in the middle of everything and it s the quietest most efficient kitchen i ve ever seen ever watch those reality shows where everyone is shouting in the kitchen  how long till the risotto is done and whatnot  i did nt hear a peep from those geniuses all night they just toiled back there and pumped miracles all night also most of the ingredients for everything made are local get thee to fnb
peace love drinks music what a mission statement and how wildly postino succeeds i love this place lovelovelove arrived in the afternoon prior to flying home to take advantage of the generous  happy hour with dollar glasses of wine and pitchers of beer was greeted by a lovely gentleman who asked if we wanted a proper table but since we did not he escorted us to a loungey area and seated us at two super comfy chairs with a nice table in between the place itself is a former historic post office  the space itself is funky and fun with lots of natural light coming in and wonderful music we jammed to bloc party passion pit and so many other great songs as we sampled their libations here were some highlights  bellini so fresh and tasty and only bucks  pinot noir can go so wrong but was so right especially for bucks  pitcher of beer a yummy citrusy wheat beer  about and a half glasses to these pitchers but again only bucks  pub board yummy warm salted pretzel bites excellent cheese chorizo and corn nuts great with beer  bruschetta omg so good one order gets you four large bruschettas lrb cut in half for sharing rrb we loved the goat cheese with roasted red peppers brie and apple with fig spread lrb swoon rrb white bean with tomatoes and salami with pesto oh so yummy the service was amazing the vibe was oh so cool and the food and drinks were priced well and yummy to me this place is like what many la places try to be but they actually succeed without being pretentious or overpriced seriously do i need to move to phoenix 
great food good prices very clean with welltrained friendly staff i have never been disappointed what a blessing to have a great cafe like this as close at dana park in mesagilbert they are blessed too never been a time that the place was nt jumpin blessings to them rrb kc
just as the card says sorin the owneroperator of absolute pool cleaning  repair is honest truly a rare find here in arizona he services the scottsdale area but will travel within the phoenix metro area he does repairs maintenance service and sales best yet aside from not wanting to rip me off is he really knew what he was doing we moved to a new home and discovered the pool was a disaster in every way he has an engineering mind and really knew all the mechanical aspects of the pool and was really logical too he is a rare find and everyone who reads this should use him or at least call him and find out for yourself he is a keeper and probably the best pool professional around
handsdown the best chicagostyle thin crust pizza in the valley
stopped in for margs and appetizers had house margaritas am i drunk  holy moly what do they put in those things  food was great drinks were better i ll be back
i could eat lunch off the floor in here seriously this place is spotless and more organized than the alphabetized labels facing out canned goods in my kitchen cupboard elaine how do i say this  i m madly in love with elaine i went to pay for some doublestick tape to hang a ticket holder in the restaurant she very politely said she thought this would nt hold instantly told me what to get and got an equally friendly person to equip me with the tools to do the job some strong glue and a couple of screws later elaine and i were smiling and enjoying a cigarette together no i kid really though i bought two screws and some glue that will hold up stainless steel and i was in and out in five minutes thanks to the staff or i would have been back and i ve got better things to do like organizing the cereal boxes rickie put the lucky charms before the capn crunch who does that 
big fan of all the food on the menu and specials throughout the week things that stick out in recent memory are the cookie skillet and the jalepeno burger and fresh foccocia sandwiches lrb they make their own foccocia bread and it is delicious rrb
i have been to this oregano s a bunch of times now and love the food you will want to come early for dinner it s always really busy the staff is always friendly and will seat you as fast as they can i always order something that s not on the menu the mild and gold wings they are the best wings i have had in arizona it s the mild sauce mixed with the italian gold sauce so good next on to the salad the antipasto thing lrb salami pepperoni capicolla romaine lettuce artichoke hearts tomatoes red peppers red onions topped with italian cheeses and tossed with italian dressing rrb this is the best antipasto i have had in arizona now for the pizza aunt margherita pizza lrb light and flaky dough add pizza sauce a four cheese italian blend fresh cut roma tomatoes fresh sliced basil rrb after all this food if you still have room what i do is get the original pizza cookie to go lrb a  pound of chocolate chip white chocolate macadamia nut or peanut butter chocolate cookie dough slightly baked in a inch pizza pan then topped with scoops of vanilla bean ice cream if you re looking for a great dinner this is one place you need to add to your list
this place is going to put phx on the map wide variety of music every night hot bar tenders including a tall curly haired red head damn she makes a killer margarita fresca if this place had a happy hour i d be there every day with my moderate drinking problem haha
this is the best and most authentic middle eastern restaurant in all of arizona i got the veggie plate here a few times and for the price and quality they can not be beat  period enough said
i spilled a large cup of coffee on my macbook pro months ago lrb luckily no cream or sugar rrb did all the recommended steps to prevent as much damage as possible and thankfully everything works except for the keyboard after months of using a separate bluetooth keyboard on top of my dead laptop keyboard i decide to take it into apple store biltmore after explaining what happened the genius tells me i ve voided my warranty and it will cost to fix the machine  without even opening it up this evidently is the cost of a new bottom case logic board etc even after running diagnostics and showing that everything is working fine apple has a policy that it either replaces everything or nothing that was nt going to work for me so i call orchard explain the situation and justin tells me they see this a lot since everything else seemed to work fine he was able to order the keyboard only as a used part harvested from a similar mbp for a few days later i bring it in and cameron was able to install the keyboard inside of two hours he also took photos of areas where corrosion had occurred and explained how he cleaned them with rubbing alcohol now my macbook pro is back to perfect condition and it only cost me thanks orchard for saving me this is nt my first time dealing with them and each experience has been positive i ve been a mac user since the late s and i ve never felt more comfortable working with another apple specialist as i do with the orchard
room was spacious pools were beautiful lobby was grand staff were friendly and helpful no coffee maker in the room though
bare recently opened inside the vivaldi salon suites at park west toni the owner and esthetician has offered a complimentary sample service for first time visitors this was great because i actually needed to get my underarms waxed anyway lrb this is one of the complimentary services for women rrb what i loved off the bat is that bare s website and appointment service was super simple to use it lists all the prices and menu items that toni offers as well making an appointment just took  clicks and sent an automatic reminder email about days before my appointment i ve been getting my underarms waxed for about years now and have been to plenty of different salons and estheticians some have ripped skin off and some have not even plucked the little hairs after waxing while some do i ve paid anywhere between to so you could say i m somewhat of an expert on what a good underam waxing should be like no really so let me count the ways about why i loved my experience at bare today rrb toni uses a high end hard wax that works a lot better than sticky wax rrb normally it takes  applications and ripoffs to get most of my hair removed which can hurt but it only took toni one time to get the hairs removed rrb and this is a bigger plus it did nt hurt at all i m serious the type of wax she uses grabbed on to the hairs so well that i barely felt it at all rrb she uses cortisone lrb as long as you are nt allergic rrb and witch hazel both of which get rid of redness and irritation rrb so i left feeling like i had nothing done pain wise and hours later i still do nt feel any irritation or pain all in all toni has a great studio and service definitely go to her for all your bare needs

i steadily get good service at buffalo wild wings and i am the type to complain on yelp about bad service my partner and i go almost weekly we are that addicted to their wings and the atmosphere it has this great sports bar feel without the cheesy greasybeerdrinkingobnoxious man feel lrb i know confusing but that s the only way i can think of how to describe it rrb we tend to go during the week and arturo is usually our server he always remembers what we want what kind of beer we have and has the beers on order before he even comes to the table lrb yes we do nt change it up much rrb he can usually guess what wings we want and every now and then we change something just to keep him on his toes  rrb if you like wings this is a great place if you want fast food do not go here they do get busy especially during football so be patient the servers are apologetic when they know they have taken a lot of time but they do try their best to get to you quickly if you pay attention you know when a server is just slacking off and these guys are nt slacking off trust me i have watched if you want good atmosphere good wings good beer and nice servers and managers come here
yum yum yum i am so thrilled to have a self serve yogurt shop within driving distance of my house now if it was nt almost a minute drive it would be even better i have already been times in so many weeks i am a fan of tart frozen yogurt and got to try the original and mango tart both were yummy my kids also have a great time picking and adding topping to the yogurt i had to limit them to toppings each per visit because they got sick the first time after adding or so
this place is so cool how some waffle poppers and took a journey around what they had to offer very cool rrb
while the prices may not be as good as what you can find at bookman s they seem to have a steadier stock better quality trade ins and loads of nonbook goodies for diversions where else can i spend an afternoon picking up nag champa cookbooks and cat butt air freshener for the car in one place before grocery shopping  that s right very few places lrb please refer me to more places with novelty air fresheners they appeal to my shallowly buried inner year old rrb it is better organized than bookman s mesa and feels cleaner blah blah women s restroom is nice etc etc but it boils down to this for me they both have their place in the buying habits of frugal bibliophiles i shop at bookman s for myself  and buy gifts or pay close to full retail price for books i absolutely need to find at changing hands i have found more rare hard to acquire anthropology archaeology and foreign language books at bookman s mesa which is why they are my favorite but i wo nt knock any stars off of changing hands for any deficiencies that are more of a function of their customer base s tradeins than anything being in the trader joe s plaza is a huge bonus as it provides me with an excuse to hit up changing hands more frequently than my checking account would really appreciate
this place was great after months of research i finally found this hotel and on top of that got a great deal on their website there were of us girls and we stayed in the bed bath suite for night there was a full kitchenette and a pull out couch in the living room also they have a complimentary buffet breakfast until am their food selection was really good too they also have a pool and a mini market in their lobby to purchase snacks beverages and even beer this hotel is conveniently located just a couple of minutes from westgate mall you wo nt be sorry if you stayed here
what an amazing organization for empowering women they have a really amazing mentor program the program starts in some coursework and sociology to sort of prepare us the classes were a blast and quite useful the mentor i met was incredibly helpful warm and kind and had great insight i really miss our visits since i moved away because she was a wise lady with clear perspective i really think that the fresh start staff went an extra mile and a half by placing me with a mentor who really was perfect for the path that i am on fresh start also brought in some business training associates and gave out scholarships for them i might have participated had i not been working at the time and had conflicting hours i was offered a scholarship at the time and i think that any woman who applied herself would qualify fresh start has an impressive job database they always had so many wonderful energetic staff who really transmitted a lot of information and light really wonderful organization a   
love the coffee the woman working the counter looked like she needed a cup to wakeup

seriously urban beans is one of my favorite spots right now and has been for quite some time their coffee drinks are amazing and you can just smell the quality when you walk in the door their food although you may not necessarily think to order it is outstanding service is awesome  they are so genuine and friendly i think their food options are even on the healthier side so a  for that in addition they hosted a series of wine tasting events two of which i attended so much fun definitely look into their upcoming events when you can as they take a lot of care in planning and making sure their customers are happy happy happy rrb a musttry

the finest the southwest has to offer a lifechanging culinary and spiritual event redefines the southwestern style as the highestofhigh in haute cuisine an adventure of detail down to the individual salt grains lrb that s for the iphoners now for the rest of the story rrb this review has been percolating in my head for six months almost to the day with the recent tighter link between yelp and facebook i realize it is time to promulgate the news that is the new gospel of southwestern cuisine as bestowed on us by chef odowd you may have read his praises in the local media these past months just one week after i dined there mobil granted it five stars  the only arizona establishment in any category to have this rating at present and one of only four restaurants in the usa given the designation this year but my introduction to kai was nothing so grand it began as a destination to commemorate a friendship i hold dear to my heart and to celebrate her birthday as is our custom i called maitre d to make several special requests including one for our dessert it was a night i shall remember for decades to come i may say the evening began the moment i crossed the property line and made my sojourn along a milelong road and through a manicured yet natural presentation of desert flora when i arrived at the hotel building entrance and stepped out of my car there was no one anywhere to be found no bellman no valet no guests the dim light of the entrance welcomed me as i walked into the grand lobby i could hear a waterfall but there was no one anywhere in sight then from nowhere a valet greeted me and took my name after that introduction ritzcarlton style every staff person i met knew my name triple bing this place celebrates the story it provides little spotlit nooks for two three or more or even seating in front of a fireplace and that s just kai s bar area we waited over a round of drinks lrb including a perfectly made sapphire martini rrb because we were told that a special table awaited us the celebration continued with the most unique and moving presentation of a menu i have ever experienced covered in textured rosefuchsiacolored fabric and inlaid with watercolor from an artist in residence our captain placed the table candle in front of it and let its flickering shadows on the fabric backlight the story of the land and the history of this property all the way to the selection of locallygrown lrb yes he pointed in the direction of the gardens rrb vegetables and herbs my eyes were welling up as he finished our pour of sparkling water was complimented with our choice of garnish including blood orange and peach among the usual lemon lime or cucumber slices lrb getting this out of the way rrb sommelier was the only distraction clearly not at his best his bumblings included improper pouring etiquette coming back to ask which duckhorn we wanted merlot or chardonnay leaving the champagne bottle on the table after the pour and not refilling our empty wine glasses when checking in on us um ok back to the bliss of course we had to order the course tasting menu each course was a sublime tapestry of flavor sensations even the onebite amuse was a symphony of all working in careful harmony i got to have two courses of fois gras lrb double bing rrb and the duck was so perfect mild and elegant that even the three salt crystals intruded on its divinity second time  round i had no salt heaven on earth lrb see my profile s last meal preference rrb the final blow was our dessert although it had the ingredients i requested it was entirely new the strawberries had been infused with a candylike vinegar and must have been several hours in their preparation the fresh mint with the presentation was merely a garnish  the strawberries were as full of mint as if they had spent their lives in the same soil  maybe they had the balsamic was carefully chosen and perfectly matched like the perfection in every other detail small pepper grains lined one side of the rim and dared us to pull them down the dish s coronation was the creme fraiche executed at the exact moment seconds before the presentation chef had to have stayed all the way to the end to make that execution with all my heart i thank chef for sharing his talent and craft these few words only vaguely illuminate the wonders that await you at kai i hope that you find your way there for a special meal  it ll be one you wo nt soon forget
indian fry bread done right prices are good nothing over and you can feed two people with a full plate of fry bread they offer a vegetarian option as well a black bean  cheese fry bread which is delicious there s even blueberry cherry and apple frybread for dessert going on the name alone the last thing i expected this place to serve was fry bread most of the other fry bread places i ve been in are kind of nasty typically there seem to be approximately three decade s worth of accumulated grime and grease anywhere there s a hard to clean crack this spot opened july and it is new modern  clean free wifi too i believe it s the nd location for the small family owned business half of the other businesses in the same strip mall have already dried up and blown away so i hope this place is able to hang on as i really like it

jacqueline photographed our engagement session in sedona last august as well as our wedding in scottsdale in march my husband and i are nt exactly comfortable in front of the camera but jacqueline made us feel at ease and relaxed because of this she captured shots that i did nt think were possible lrb for us anyways rrb while planning my wedding i encountered additional stress from nearly every vendor i worked with but not jacqueline she was prompt did what she said she would and even made me laugh when i was near tears at some very stressful points our family and friends all commented on how great of a job she did capturing large group shots and working with my five year old nephewring bearer lrb who refused to smile rrb by the end of the night jacqueline was showing my nephew how to take pictures with her camera and he was in heaven she is just amazing with kids if you are looking for someone who will help you appear relaxed and confident in front of the camera look no further my husband and i do nt think of ourselves as photogenic people but jacqueline managed to capture shots that look as though they were ripped from the pages of a magazine her pricing is extremely reasonable given her talent and everything we received in our package lrb engagement session slideshows all photos on a disk and an online viewing gallery rrb i really ca nt say enough about how happy we are with jacqueline s work i have recommended her to friends who need a photographer and i would urge anyone looking for a photographer to check out her work to see her talent for yourself on top of all that she is a pleasure to work with we recently purchased a new home and we look forward to having her capture our first christmas card photo there later this month rrb
i love this place mike  julie are amazing we had so much fun if your shy dont plan on sitting in the front because they may call on you for crowd participation i was amazed at how well they knew the most random songs the waitresses did a great job even when it was packed i would recommend going there to just about anyone looking for a good time if your a stick in the mud then just stay home rrb
this was one of the first places i tried when i moved here from ohio last year i was told you have to get the crepes and sure enough that is what i get every time i go it s hard for me to order just one thing so usually i order a crepe as my dessert even though i m tempted with all those delicious pastries staring me down in the display case if i did nt live on the other side of town i would probably be there times a week lrb and probably weight four times my size now rrb it is such a unique little place with not one bad thing on the menu i always bring my out of towners there to eat as well
best donuts in the valley i like a variety of donuts lrb my favorites though are raised sugar and raised glaze rrb and all the donuts here are great never too heavy always tasting fresh
everything was phenomenal the patio out back has the perfect ambiance for an intimate evening inside is bright and constantly moving the three cheese flatbread has a mouthful of magic in every bite even the bread with pesto and butter was the best little loaf of bread i ve ever eaten the chicken blt is highly reccomended for the bacon lover in your life the owner even stopped by our table to say hi i love this place you should too edit oh man i almost forgot to write about their potato chips they are kettle chips and i ca nt place the flavor lrb spicy tangy bbqy limey rrb except that they were so delicious i wanted to take a truckload home with me
i was referred to todd at alcatraz from a key service he was very friendly professional and courteous he came out and made me a new chip key for half the price of what my insurance quoted me he also cut me a nd nonchipped key for free in case i lock my other keys in my car the entire job took him less than minutes i will definitely be recommending alcatraz to friends in need of a locksmith
this was goodness we ordered the mozzarella cheese plate as an appetizer which was really good i asked our server what plates he recommended and he said that if he went once in his life to the restaurant he would eat either the meatloaf or the steak for some reason meatloaf sounded good and i went for it the gf ordered the scallops the scallops were good however she ordered the half plate and it was just scallops the server had said that the half plate of this would be really small they were good but in my opinion not great the meatloaf however was out of this world probably the best one i ever had it was loaded with bacon inside and it was just perfect the mashed potatoes that came with it were very good as well we also ordered the prosciutto mac and cheese as a side it rocked our face off probably the best one i ve ever eaten lrb it goes head to head with a green chile mac and cheese i had once in santa fe ca nt decide which one s better rrb a must order if you re there especially if you like prosciutto gotta love the saltiness in all i would call it stars for the meatloaf and the mac and cheese however i would nt consider the scallop plate a star one
lovely just lovely we started out with the asian nachos to kick off the girls weekend celebrating our girl shenna birthday the asian nachos were off the hook i had the other two items of the tapas menu mahi mahi tacos and vegetable tempura washed down with a huge washington apple martini yum the girls were having the sangria drink special looked good but i m a martini girl check out the highlight in a little for the morning after heh heh
always good food with a clean environment  this location always seems to have good music and extremely helpful staff
the first time i went there i had fingernails in my mouth but i gave it a second chance and they never cease to impress me i love how healthy they are i always get the bowls for maximum healthiness little rice barbacoa both beans guac mild medium salsa and lettuce i have to say that i am a proud chipotle fan rrb
my husband and i had a great lunch here on sunday the steamed mussels oysters sea bass and beetroot and goat s cheese salad were all outstanding the service was impeccable also
i ve been coming here since they opened around five years ago and i have been a regular customer since i m what you could call a devotee so consider that when you read this gushing review this is a familyrun neighborhood restaurant in a strip mall storefront next to a hair salon and a small boxing gym it s not a fancy place but do nt let that fool you the people in the kitchen and the sushi bar have impressive restaurant credentials going back many years and across the pacific they are fanatical about food quality to the point where i ve seen them toss what any other restaurant would call a perfectly good fish shipment if it was not up to their standards they are friendly and gracious and your enjoyment of the food is foremost it s a place where you can sit at the sushi bar and ask the chefs to decide what you re eating trust koji and lori and be impressed with just about everything the sushi and sashimi are extremely fresh and very tasty and they always have some sort of unusual or seasonal fish special you ca nt find anywhere else they do nt have a ton of variety on the menu  maybe or rolls the usual assortment of nigiri and then sashimi and hand rolls  but what they do have is made with topquality ingredients and delicious sushi bar specials are on the board behind the chefs and they re happy to take time to explain what they are and even though i go there primarily for sushi the kitchen items have never disappointed noodle dishes and soups are hearty and very reasonably priced and for lunch they have a large selection of bentos that include rolls and sashimi so you can have the best of both worlds they even have a wonderful steak and lobster combination that would give any fancy steakhouse in town a run for its money if there are any complaints i could possibly have it s that the table service can be a little spotty at times it just seems unorganized because there s enough staff to handle it but everyone seems to be doing every job rather than having a host a server a runner etc nevertheless i ca nt recommend this place enough for a casual yet delicious meal
pulled pork over rice with compelling seasoned tater tots lrb rosemary  garlic rrb gutsy sauce was utterly unique darryl king prepared it hot and packaged it with style for takeaway service
i have only been to cornish pasty twice but both times it was fantastic the first time i shared their signature pasty the oggie and the second time i got one the veggie spicy asiago the veggie one was so awesome i ate the whole damn thing and that s a lot of food they also have an awesome beer selection the only semi drawback is that they take awhile to make
having lived in or traveled through states this is by far the best bar ever i used to play volleyball here about  hours a week and go home tired and sober every night asu girls and luke afb guys playing and chatting while in the rotation line on weekends mello grilling and fixing your own hamburger while sipping a cold one with scottsdale leisure league friends during the week one special th of july playing till dawn with two beautiful women and my best bud pete in a light drizzle it was impossible to find so only a good friend could turn you onto it thanks for all the amazing memories someday i hope to have a bar just like it kudos to the owners for making it the greatest bar ever created so sad it s gone
as good as it gets my whole family goes to this dentist and we are all very happy with the quality of the work and the service the skill of this dentist is just top notch
i really enjoyed my lunch from hey joes i had the valley plate lumpia had alot of flavor pancit was good i had the coconut and it was fantastic really fresh and young water was great meat was very tender great lunch portions were plenty too for
very impressed with the service of this place and quality of the course the course and the greens are in great shape i am rating this on having a year old that wanted to go out and play golf most places of this high quality would never allow a young one to go out but after pm they do and the kid had free rental clubs which was nice they did everything to make sure we are away from other people and not pushed my son and i had a great time because of the level of service to make us feel welcomed
i think everyone has said most everything that needs to be said about this place but i ll highlight the reasons i frequent switch free wifi good drinks recession plate special  that is always as awesome as the rest of their menu good happy hour specials open til pm days a week good wine greatfriendly wait staff their salads are out of control  amazing i think i could happily supportinvest in switchfezticoz dynasty for all of eternity if i had the means
love love love otf hour workout worth every penny if you are serious about challenging yourself and getting in better shape i have gone to different teachers  kathy daren chris jesse and dan i liked all of their classes each was a little bit different from the treadmill routine to how many sets on the rowing machine to what exercises you did with hand weights or trx or bosu ball etc prior to otf i had never used a heart rate monitor so i was very intrigued by this blinky thing you wear around your chest i liked that my heart rate was displayed for me to see easily so i could push harder if i needed to that s the best part  pushing yourself to the limits it s much easier in this format with a personal trainer leading the class getting you pumped and excited to run faster and harder i already run on my own but i am rarely excited to keep going unless there are cheerleaders i doubt i am the only one who feels this struggle the other thing i like is there is always a great mix of people people to be inspired by for many reasons what are you waiting for  get ready to fit in your skinny shorts also tips  they have a shower in the bathroom if you need to go straight to work after and whole foods is right around the corner if you want a fresh protein shake from their cafe
some day i hope to be rich enough to only shop here in the meantime i get to go in and dream of buying all my groceries at such a wonderful place and pick a few items that are within my sad budget this store really is amazing the selection of prepared foods healthyspecial diet items etc is amazing this trip i bought the nan and heated it up for dinner and it was so soft flavorful and perfect it was even better than the nan i had at the last indian restaurant i went to i also got the pleasure of trying sweet republic s ice cream which had some really unique flavors i loved the honey lavender and it was a great way to finish off shopping i was able to find produce that i have nt found in even other high end stores like aj s i wish i had one closer to me although i would probably be broke because i would never cook again i would just go there every few days and try everything
i did not have the pleasure of dining here but i did have the pleasure of drinking the most notable thing for me personally was that az appeared to be the spot lrb or at least one of the few spots rrb in scottsdale open late enough on a weekday night to suit my vegas lifestyle i mean i am not generally one to ask where can a girl get a drink in this town  but on this occasion i did and az stepped up they have a fabulous patio and a nice list of swanky cocktails i just really enjoyed the atmosphere sitting outside sipping on libations i enjoyed a fine pimm s cup and even though i did nt drink it the celebratory champagne complete with confetti was entertainment for the entire table my drinking companion relished it so much she decided to order confetti in every glass of her champagne confetti cocktails what s not stars about that 
update ptc s prices are now per movie i m going to second the five stars on this place yes they re second run films you could pick them up on dvd but who are you kidding  nothing beats sitting in a theater to see a movie for the first time personally i m too broke to enjoy a film i am only kinda interested in during a first run for three bones i can go and see a film as it was intended to be seen on a gigantic screen with a sticky seat and two kids making out three rows back i call that movie magic the fact that their showtimes are advertised on their website is also a big gold star in the lobby they have life size statues of laurel and hardy batman storm troopers and a few others who does nt love that  i know i do
i am a regular customer here and here are just a few of the things that keep me repeatedly coming back  wonderful clothing shoes purses jewelry and all kinds of accessories at great prices  personable friendly and knowledgeable staff who remember you  stock is always different and there are pieces for just about any look you want to achieve lrb so many places get stale so quickly with low turnover of stock not the case here rrb i also consign here and their terms are quite good three doors to the left of nordstrom rack in the promenade scottsdale rd  frank lloyd wright  robi the owner truly  does  have an eye for fashion and knows what to take in everyone i ve met who works there will tell you honestly lrb if you ask rrb whether or not something looks good on you if by chance you are uncertain when i shop i go to urban exchange first and generally find what i need whether it is an outfit for an interview a night on the town working out for work or just regular everyday hanging out clothes  they have a great selection price range depends on the item in which you are interested  however you are guaranteed to be getting a superb deal either way
we took my mom here for her birthday tonight and we really really enjoyed it the place was very clean nice looking and super friendly professional service lrb thanks nick rrb alot of guests seemed like they knew each other and the staff so it had a very homey and welcoming feel they had an extensive wine list too bad they did nt have a moscato lrb my new favorite rrb but we ordered the riesling instead which was still wonderful i had the chicken saltimboca mom had the braised beef and her husband had the eggplant rollintini everything was very tasty not greasy heavy and over salted just real flavors of all the food they also bring out the best garlic bread i must have ate pieces the cannoli was made exactly how it should be made and the tartufo was excellent along with an illy espresso yum what a very pleasant dining and food experience i will definitely be back
i have nothing but great things to say about this place i have been to both locations in the valley lrb biltmore and the scottsdale quarter rrb and not only is the food mouth watering the atmosphere is so great i ca nt wait to go back again
hands down the best pizza ever get the margarita with proccutio omg sadly the wait is ooh soo long why they do nt turn bar bianco into extra seating for the pizzeria i do nt know and do nt care take a date it s fun
omg love chelsea s kitchen love it first you must have the chicken nachitos the roasted chicken spinach salad is awesome this is what i order most of the time because i think it balances the chicken nachito pig out that prefaces the main course however the fish tacos are great too i love hanging out on the patio it s so lovely and the weather is getting nice now to sit outside perfection the staff is great and the service is fast but not rushed i wish the owners would open up a place in south phoenix  we are hungry for nonchain restaurants
i ve been going to this chili s for years  the staff is always very friendly and the food is consistently good my fav is the guiltless chicken sandwich i love wine and recently they revamped their list which i m really happy about try the onehope sauvignon blanc  it was great
do nt believe the haters  this place has the best pizza ever sure you have to wait hours if you do nt make a reservation so make a damn reservation the best way to do it is call exactly a month ahead of time about an hour before they open it s a bit of a hassle getting the minimum amount of people together but it s well worth it and it can make a fun event out of going to an amazing restaurant
trader joe s is just wonderful i have been shopping here since shortly after i moved to az ten years ago and the only complaint i have is that i get hooked on something and then it just goes away i do nt know if it is supply problems or if this joe guy is just cruel but bring back the tvp taco and sloppy joe mix other than the evolving product line there is nothing i do nt like about tj s you do nt have to worry about sales because they do nt have them you do nt have to worry about seeing rachael ray s maniacal face grinning at you from a box of triscuits because they do nt sell them most of what they sell is their own brand which means there is quality assurance because they are putting their name on everything they sell they get one star simply for the free food samples that are usually available and the free coffee that is always available as another reviewer mentioned the prices are actually very reasonable the prices on their cheese alone is worth going in for if you want to pair the cheese with wine they have a lof of choices and a lot of bargains check out their premade food also i have not been disappointed
love this place always great service food is fresh and delicious
i think the chuck box has been around since the time my dad went to asu which was many many years ago when i was living in az i would come here occasionally  i ve been here a couple times over the past few years when i ve been in town for a visit the burgers lrb and bbq chicken sandwiches rrb at the chuck box are delicious if you like burgers  can care less ambianceatmosphere then come here if ambianceatmosphere mean a great deal to you then you might as well stop reading this review  ignore the five stars like i said the burgers  bbq sandwiches are fantastic lrb and according to my mom and sister the hot dogs are as well they re served cut in half on hamburger buns rrb everything is grilled to order so it all tastes fresh a couple things at the chuck box that i think get overlooked because of the burgers are the sides particularly the fried mushrooms  zucchini i do nt know what it but the mushrooms in particular are to die for in addition there s a large condiment bar wplenty of fixings wanything you can think to put on a burger including ranch dressing which is perfect for the mushrooms  zucchini the place itself is nt much to look at but who cares  there s only one person taking orders as you walk in and there s often times a line almost out the door they also just call orders out as they re ready not necessarily in the order as they were placed so things can gets a little helterskelter but in the end it s all good and the chuck box is as good as it gets
i ordered flowers for my wife s anniversary from fiesta what a stunning job the flowers were great and reasonably priced this is the only flowere shop i would trust for this special occasion i have ordered floweres for my daughter s birthday and had them sent to her out of state shannon the owner made this as painless as you could ever hope for if you need flowers to really look berautiful and have complete trust that all details will be met then you must use fiesta flowers i have been going to fiesta ever since it opened and have never been disappointed i even used fiesta for a wedding of a relative and had complete success good and beautiful flowers and reasonable prices fantastic fantastic fantastic
i have been getting facials from mary at skin bliss for years she does excellent work and really cares about what she is doing for her clients some skin spas cut corners by purchasing less expensive and inferior skin care products but mary uses the best and it shows in the treatments i also enjoy going to her spa because it is relaxing and you get complete one on one attention no sitting around in a waiting room looking at magazines with other ladies try her out
love banfield i ve been coming here since i adopted my bundle of joy last february staff is very friendly and i m usually in and out of appointments fairly quickly everyone is really loving and gentle with the animals here as well facilities are always very clean
this place has by far the best gyros in chandler do nt be fooled by the strip mall it s in this place is a hidden gem we had the original gyro and their humas both were extremely fresh
a great place the service was excellent even with a large table protein pancakes are amazing
fast friendly and clean you do nt get to say that too often when describing a post office serously though these guys are great
message salad of kale glad kitchen only open thurs  sat or i would be there every night
i love this store i went with my husband in june to pick up a clutch for our anniversary we had a wonderful sa i feel horrible that i forgot his name having never been to this location he left his area at chanel and escorted us downstairs i picked out an amazing ysl and tory burch unfortuanetly i had an emergency with my yr old and had to go pick him up from daycare before i could buy them when i went back a few days later he had put them aside for me and even helped me get a nm gift card to purchase my bags since they do nt accept visa he also remembered why i had to leave the first time and asked how my son was doing im sorry if other people had a bad experience but mine was great
this is one of my absolute favorite restaurants the ambiance the food the service this place has it all i was a fan of richardson s but the rokerij is such a nice place and i hope they will continue to offer both menus my only beef is we booked a table for a group on open table and when we got to the restaurant no reservations honestly i think the problem was on open table s end we ended up having to go to a different place but that can happen anywhere
if you are a beer lover this is like disneyland minus the lines and crying children rotating taps with lots of locals and bottles and if you re feeling overwhelmed they have an awesome app you can download that helps you sort through the beers by color alcohol  and style there s also tons of tvs making it a great place to watch a game and have a beer or two lrb or five rrb if you spend to get a loyalty card you earn points towards discountsprizes for each beer you drink they do nt serve food but they partnered with a handful of nearby restaurants who will deliver your food to wob for no extra charge i ca nt remember all of the restaurants but i know jimmy john s robbie foxes and fuzzy s tacos were on the list the only negatives is i wish it was bigger on a friday or saturday night i feel like it is going to be obnoxiously crowded but i am one who likes to be able to sit down at a bar so take that with a grain of salt they did say they are planning on opening up the upstairs area and getting some patio seating so that might help it looks like they will be able to open the windows up when the weather is nice which will be perfect for sunday fundays bottom line  if you are a beer lover come give praise at your new mecca
why is nt there a th star for really amazing things like thrifty ice cream  have you had this before  i have not been to this actual location  there used to be thrifty s all over town but now they are all gone and their ice cream is sold in water mart stores anyhow back in the day it was like cents a scoop  they have the most amazing scooper ever it s like square shaped and perfect i would get the mint and chip and chocolate chip and when i would order i would stutter and get nervous that i would mess up saying mint and chip and chocolate chip the man lrb probably was a teenager but to me as a child anyone over was a man rrb would hand me the ice cream and i would hand him either dimes or dime and nickles or nickels or well you get the point  this stuff was only cents back then now it is about a scoop and worth every red penny the best ice cream ever ever
cartel coffee lab has assumed proprietorship of sola coffee bar and is providing espresso addicts with uberexcellent thick  crema libations made by using a deceptively small la marzocco machine  try it
simply the best burger place in town and also the only one open past midnight i always get the turkey burger and sweet potato fries both amazing always clean great atmosphere just love the place very reasonable prices and always nice to visit
stopped by for a quick lunch with my boss neither of us had been before and we were both craving mexican i was a little apprehensive because it has a little of the whole in the wall look to it but i am usually happily surprised with the rougher looking establishments i order the chicken chimichanga which i believe is the yes way to judge a mexican restaurant it was probably one of the best i have ever had and if you know me you know i love mexican food the service was great and there salsa was amazing i will definitely be going back
very good not the type of mexican food i grew up with but a lighter more flavorful fare
notice the cool eyeglasses that i m sporting these days  i got them at sassy glasses you see unfortunately there s this strange thing that happens when you get older than  you start to lose your eyesight seriously i was struggling with seeing it got so bad i did nt like to read anymore and i d have to go to bed at because my eyes were so tired i could nt see anymore either everything was blurry so i went to the eye doctor and he gave me a prescription for guess what bifocals if you re over and a woman you know what a serious blow this is to one s ego in any case i took my prescription to sassy glasses and they hooked me right up with a stunning pair of transitional bifocals that look pretty cool lrb sounds like something miley cyrus would say rrb they were great to work with prices were reasonable for designer eye wear not old lady eye wear and they even sent me a thank you card afterwards so if you re like me and in denial about needing glasses check out sassy glasses they just might have a pair that will make you look great
cherubini is one of a slew of local digs that have opened recently in tempe that defy the normal conventions of local and mom and pop everything about this place is welldesigned and polished i actually had to ask the first time i went in if it was locally owned or part of some corporate chain i had never heard of which is a good thing the only thing i miss about eatingdrinking at big chain restaurants is the thought given to the design and feel of the space my absolute favorite thoughtful thing they did in the space  this actually made me giggle the first time i saw it  was build this sort of indoor trellisgazebo thing to break up the same old retail storefront void and lrb here s the cool part rrb they thought to put electrical outlets in almost every one of the posts just about every table in the joint has power right next to it great coffee better doughnuts dangerous doughnuts especially in a place with a drivethru all of these elements  fast wireless  everyone s new favorite caffeine dealer
papago park is a great place to ride lrb bicycles that is rrb the terrain can be as easy or as hard as you d like  just choose your trail
i ca nt say enough good things about this place the shoe department is my favorite department followed by tbd i did nt think i could love a store as much as i loved marshall field s in chicago in fact i had to have a moment of silence when marshall field s closed however nordstrom s is a close second also fashion square mall rocks
the food here is amazing they have vegan vegetarian options which is so refreshing i have eaten there three times and it has been great every time the prices are great too  and under
awesome awesome awesome the entire menu is delectable this one in phoenix was the first macaroni grill i d been to but i ve since been to locations in pensacola chattanooga and orlando all of them are consistently excellent it s fun and familyfriendly lrb your waiter will write his name on your paper tablecloth in crayon upside down so that you can read it then leave the crayons for you to go crazy with rrb also they leave a bottle of house wine at your table and then charge you by the glass using the honor system lrb though i d imagine if you finished the bottle and claimed one glass they d catch on rrb add this to my list of places i wish were near me but sort of glad they are nt because i d be a lot poorer if they were

self described as a modern tavern the vig is a shining little sparkle of a bar in the middle of an otherwise unimpressive area the space is open and comfortable the atmosphere is upscale but casual and the oh geez i ca nt even think about the luxurious wood grains and summervacationinthehamptons furniture appointments as i am overcome with an almost pavlovian fixation with the fact that this place has bocce ball as its main attraction pair almost any dated archaic or kitschy activity with alcohol and i m pretty much useless to resistance but bocce pushes me almost to utter nirvana there s no sign up sheet and from the few times i ve been here perfect strangers are relatively eager to make bocce alliances if it s late enough you may even be joined by the chef and owner doug who encourages mischief on the court including but not limited to human obstacles flagrant taunting or ridiculous balllaunching methods and the vig s outstanding gin selection is a big sell it almost feels like what the merc bar would be if it had a patio and did nt have over years of spilled drinks and smoke damage it s new it s hot and i hear the burgers are nt too shabby i m looking forward to checking out the dining menu but until that happens i m left to encourage you to share in the unpretentious fun the vig offers
this is a classic tempe institution if you have nt been there you need to go great diner food and some of the best breakfast foods around the wait staff is great and the prices are very reasonable a couple favorites are the chorizo and eggs and the tom mix great for a quick breakfast or lunch
really enjoyed this place my parents found it in the newspaper a few months back and have been raving about it i was in town over turkey day and they brought me phenomenal food the kung pao beef was unbelievable i wo nt even waste my time trying to tell you why because there are just no words  go order it the sun devil chicken was equally amazing my mouth is watering as i type great  fast service and very modern spin lrb decorwise rrb on a chinese restaurant shanghai grill only affirms my believe that the best of the best restaurants are found in strip malls i highly recommend this place
this place was great my sister  i were in town for the weekend from cali and we wanted to find a fun happy place to eat this place had food that melted in your mouth i got the prime rib we sat on the patio which was wonderful the waitress was great she knew her stuff  kept an eye on us while taking care of other people great memories thanks
i have been going here for years the outside seating is gone now but it was terribly noisy once the was built this used to back pima rd when there was a pima rd the remodel was fantastic more seating and a modern atmosphere reminiscent of bellagio and other new vegas sites this place has the best bread and desserts i especially like the honor system bread purchase i use this often i used to not go for a long time because it was such a hassle to wait on a huge line just to get a baguette to go this location took care of that problem and at only a baguette that s a steal ciabatta rolls are the best i have found for take out and making sandwiches at home real crispy out and soft in best place to buy sourdough loaves too everything is fresh try the deserts it took me years to try it now it s a must have every time
aye dios mios i think i have died and gone to carne asada heaven the reviews were right sonora grill is astounding i was so impressed with everything i ordered the carne asada hands down is the best in the valley the shrimp was plump and flavorful the tortillas were fresh and the guacamole oh the guacamole mas deliciosa while the chips may not have been fresh they were still the perfect vehicle to scoop up the salsas i devoured i was even impressed with the rice and beans and usually these seem to be an afterthought in most mexican meals at sonora they paid as much attention to the flavorful sides as the rest of the menu qu bueno the girl that helped us behind the counter was friendly and helpful and really knew her stuff if i owned a restaurant i would try and steal her away this is a new favorite that is now in my regular rotation
my wife and i as well as several of our friends drive from ahwatukee on a regular basis to dine at flo s on thompson peak and frank lloyd wright blvd miles is nt too far for this food we ve been eating here since the s and have always been pleased i discovered it when i worked in the area and used to stand in line for lunch it was so busy our favorites lemon pepper chicken with extra lemon wedges and the kung pow although i ca nt think of anything i would nt order
this place is amazing the location is great i ordered the carne asada burrito and it was filled wih the best steak i ve ever had in a burrito the staff is friendly and the people watching is perfect definitely a small location and is somewhat fast food esque i would recommend to anyone looking to get out of the office for lunch delicious
 yogurtland as i say it with a highpitched tone in the end this is my ultimate favorite dessert i would give stars if yelp allows it all my friends know that i am attached to this place we started this craziness together with my better half when we tried it a few years back after a basketball game and all i said after first walking in was this is fun and we got hooked eversince that i collect their spoons only used by me and the hubbie and i now have ygl cups full of spoons i am the ultimate yogurtland addict heehee we go as often as times a week that we already know the staff in this location and we go that often that we even tried to abstain from it for lent just to see if we can resist it haha most of our friends also keep on asking to try other fro yo places to see if something will beat my ygl addiction and so far nothing has won over it yet  d so my favorite flavors are taro pistachio and toasted coconut and the of course the seasonal flavors pumpkin pie gingerbread oh i wanna go now just thinking about it my favorite toppings are the yogurt chips sugar cone sunflower seeds shredded coconut and graham  rrb perfect blend of flavors so if you have nt tried it yet grab your favorite partner and enjoy some yogurtland  rrb
i adore truly authentic italian cuisine and i think mike o sums it up well daniel really does understand the essence of traditional italian food i ve had fine italian cuisine all around the world lrb including europe rrb and the lasagna lrb his grandmother s recipe rrb is still some of the best the prices reflect the quality of the food and the servers are always right on the money with wine pairings i ve entertained friends and clients from around the country and around the world at daniels i ve never heard one single complaint now i m not going to say that they are incapable of error and after reading paul g s review i was hoping he d give daniel s another try then upon reading the rest of his reviews i now see his frame of reference ummmm let s see he gave chain restaurants z tajas  grand luxe stars i like z and grand luxe too but cmon really  real foodies help me out here bon appetite
this is straight up the best sandwich place for carnivores long ago when i still ate meat i ordered the club and was floored by how good it was at the time i was quite the club sandwich aficionado i guess you could say i was a club sandwich member lrb har har har rrb there is so much meat on this thing that it s near disturbing and the portions are huge the half sandwich is literally about the size of a typical full sandwich besides the name is bison witches get it  bison witches buy sandwiches that s just plain clever
my sandwich lrb  grilled pork rrb had almost two times the meat it normally does still ca nt beat the flavor and portion size for the price including tax the best thing to do is call ahead and walk up to the outside pickup window it will save you a bunch of time
i ve been meaning to write a review for econo lube for awhile now this is the place we go to service both our cars and we would nt go anywhere else these are the type of mechanics that you want they are always honest helpful and friendly they have a bunch of thank you notes up in their waiting room and i believe every single one of them we have been very lucky to find this place

where else can you see pouters pet a wallaby and eat roasted corn  the fair is the bomb as it were my dear love and i went one afternoon the weather was glorious the crowds were light and there was plenty to see and do we spent a little while in the body exhibit which is a little to much for me but others certainly seemed to like learning about the body including my dear love i love the fair and we had a good time
i ve always driven past them until a few months back and havent gone any place else ever since i never go to the same place twice in a row simply because i really dont care about my haircuts and its pretty simple i ve been to the ones in paradise valley and supercuts its really not something i think about until i started going here now this place is nice the people are friendly they do their best to accommodate you and are very very good at what they do stars
it is rare for me to find a place that has such a relaxed atmosphere that makes you feel welcome the moment you arrive then almost never do i find a place like that that also has great food service and good prices this has become one of my favorite lunch spots and also a favorite dinner spot we even had my friends birthday there strongly recommend
i really like this place it s close to home and the staff here is pretty cool great specials on drinks and i have been impressed with their food i either order chicken fingers with honey mustard because it s kinda spicy or the rueben and neither let me down i feel like i m in cheers  same people here everytime i come and the vibe is very chill i want to recommend this place but i feel like it is a secret spot so do nt tell your friends  rrb if you are in the area looking for a drink then definitely stop by
to all of you over  easy haters get bent honestly if this place was so bad why give it two stars instead of one  if you going to get all office space on somthin put your bigboy pants on and drop the friggen hammer also do nt write a review just because they were closed when you had a snack attack and it fizzed you this is a m e r i c a not communist china lrb you eat egg now rrb the proprietors of this fine establishment can open and close as they see fit and to finish this place is the king better than matt s i like matt s but it is over easy s bitch squirell style
for years i would always go to lowe s or home depot first because i thought they d have larger selections and better prices but then i found that in many cases ace was cheaper even better i can find things lrb or find out they do nt have it rrb in a fraction of the time because their employees are helpful and accessible lots of times ace carries items that the other stores do nt especially hardware now i always go to ace first because if they have it i am in and out in a flash
i love love this store their reduced fat chicken salad and pasedena salads are to die for the prepackaged frozen meals are also yummy my daughter loves their yogurt and premade pasta meals their clif bars are  the price as supermarkets the employees are extremely nice and helpful i would so recommend this store to any and every one
hidaway is right had to call to make sure additional parking in the rear was really the door asked my husband if he wanted to go in  was a little scary for the moment had a sign posted for a liquor license we were both blown away by the aroma as we entered and time warped to the middle of montana s maybe we sat at the bar and had an amazing appetizer dinner was planning on getting a little something before we met our son for dinner at houston s lrb sorry houston s my husband ate all of his scallops rrb yes i said blackened scallops which blows eddie v s out of the water i ca nt wait to get back to phoenix just to eat here

i walked in to essence of nails without an appointment i was greeted politely and seated right away for my spa pedicure lrb the manicure would come after rrb the decor inside the salon is so nice totally unlike many of the other salons i ve been to which have blank walls and no life the salon is painted a warm color with a nice finish and all of their equipment matched exactly everything coordinated so well which added to the relaxing experience of the spa pedicure well the massage chair definitely added to that relaxation too rrb i got deluxe pedicure with a hot stone massage which was out of this world amazing very relaxing as i just mentioned the pedicure includes a hot stone massage which i love it everyone in the salon seemed to be working at a good pace focusing on each customer rather than rushing through each person just to start the next lrb which i see a lot in other salons rrb a note about my manicure it has nt peeled off yet usually a french manicure wo nt even last throughout the day let alone an entire week at least one of my nails usually chips the same day i get them done but not this one i love this place this place is located in casa grande mall and the only mall in this town it s perfect for shopping for my favorite stores and restaurants after i got my service done definitely a star experience great service relaxation and a manicure and pedicure that are lasting i will definitely be back

i rarely go to indian restaurants but this is a place i love to visit often the food seems as if it was done with great interest when u go there order anything with rice they cook it to perfection i like their handi dishes a lot if there is one thing i can suggest it is that they should stop adding food coloring to some of their dishes no need to guild this lilly

went to a free teaser show today for first friday and loved it the girls were amazing we saw belly dancing hula girls singers and a burlesque show the mc is lucy morals who is also headmistress for the wayward school for girls which is where most of the performs get there start lrb or at least that was my impression rrb she was hilarious and very raunchy  just what you would expect i only wish that it had been a full show so we could have seen them really strip down instead of just miming it i will deff be getting tickets to the real deal in the future
i m originally from the midwest and for some reason we do nt have places like this there yogurtland was heaven for me i love making my own ice cream and love lots and lots of stuff in my ice cream i hated going to coldstone and other places where they controlled how much was in my ice cream since i ve lived here for awhile now i ve experienced other places similar to this and sorry but mojo s and cherry on top ai nt got nothing on yogurtland mojo s sucks and is expensive yogurtland is inexpensive and their frozen yogurt flavors are amazing and added bonus when i do nt feel like being a fat child i can make a really yummy healthy treat from the lowfatlowsugar yogurts and fruit loves it
we saw the sign out front that read under new management i was a bit concerned because the last and only other time i was there i got great food service  value as soon as i saw the same gentleman behind the counter lrb brandon rrb i knew it was all good brandon is incredibly friendly  accommodating he remembered me  my family from our only other visit a couple of months ago we had awesome madetoorder burgers fries  drinks for each we found the secret little patio out back and enjoyed our wonderful lunch this is the kind of place that makes you want to forget about all the big burger chains  support the small local guys good stuff

 corsets  martini s the gorgeous staff are wearing corsets so if you mind a guy comparison shopping than steer clear i do nt mind beautiful people or beautiful decors  this cup over flows abundantly with both great martini s  a bar menu that rocks i understand this is a chain in vegas florida ca as well as here i bet they do quite well with all the eye candy i do nt know where they found these beauties but they look very minnesotan to me my tiara s ca nt compare to theirs
a fine dining establishment that is a real treat to eat at i discovered this place when attending the community manager yelp event lrb cmye rrb and was enticed by the flavors and array of dishes presented us i made a special note to return for the baconwrapped shrimp soon i brought a date here for my return visit and insisted we order the shrimp appetizer she loved it somehow pcg manages to crisp the bacon perfectly without overcooking the lrb somewhat huge rrb shrimp the tartarsauce like dipping sauce however was too creamy it took away from sweetness of the shrimp and saltiness of the bacon we found the vinaigrette on the bed of greens the shrimp were served on to be a better brighter accompaniment that did not take away from the other flavors entrees were amazing i had the cedarplank salmon that came with horseradish mashed potatoes and citrusmarinated roasted beets the warm beets really complemented the dish nicely  a wellcomposed and wellbalanced plate that i wo nt soon forget my date enjoyed the grilled beef tenderloin i could not help but to steal a couple of her sherryglazed mushrooms when she was nt looking swipe we topped off a perfect dinner with the warm croissant bread pudding great date destination and food that you will never forget
i tried the new hamburger with pulled pork amazing and the sauces are the cherry on top they ve converted me
i have been here alot more times than my checkin reflect i think lowes is more goto for home improvement this particular lowes is always well stocked and the staff is super friendly one of my recent purchases include a new sliding shower door for the kiddos bathroom of course i had illusions of grandeur on how  me installing a shower door would come out  a few extra parts and lots of caulk later the kids will no longer be getting their bathroom floor wet yeah for me
s and s has been there since the beginning they were my first choice in getting offroad tires for my minibike in th grade turf tires for my gokart in th and getting my oil changed as a poor and devastatingly handsome college student now they do require an appointment for getting an oil change and it takes about minutes included with the oil change was a full diagnostic of your vehicle and are in no way pushy about any repairs it s too bad they do nt share my enthusiasm for the gokart version of the fast and the furious as much as i d like them to be
reasons why i love cpc great food great prices great atmosphere nice staff delivery i had never tasted the glory that is a pasty until i went there by recommendation of a friend a few years ago ever since my first visit i have been hooked i have learned to order one pasty for lunch and get another togo for later  because knowing me i will have a second craving during the day the first time i went i courageously tried their chicken tikka masala pasty my grandfather is from india and i was raised on traditional indian food so i was a skeptic however their take on chicken masala lrb typically consisting of chicken red curry potatoes vegetables and accompanied with rice rrb was impressive there was just the right amount of curry to chicken to vegetable ratio and i could not help but want to scarf it down it was mild so anyone could love it even their vegetarian tikka masala pasty is delicious as a former vegetarian and vegan i am always skeptical when trying new meat substitutes but the quorn chicken substitute has a great consistency another time i went i tried their shepherd s pie pasty and declared that a victory the pastry shell was crisp the filling was flavorful and the peas and carrots had nt gone to mush you can tell that they make the pasties lrb pastys  rrb fresh just by biting into them but if you re not convinced sit up at the bar and watch i will say one of the best pasties they have is their lovely bit a salmon it took me a while to be able to order it because every time i tried they were sold out lrb and for good reasoning rrb i got lucky one unassuming tuesday afternoon while ordering delivery for my mother my roommate and myself they were surprisingly prompt in their delivery and did nt seem to get lost with my crappy directions to my apartment i ordered the salmon my mother the pilgrim lrb soooo good rrb and my roommate the cheese steak lrb i did nt try his but he said it was awesome rrb the salmon pasty was heaven i am not kidding  heaven wrapped in a delicate pastry blanket and hand delivered from the almighty himself the salmon was cooked to perfection the dill sauce was mild the asparagus still al dente the potatoes were perfect and the tomatoes and spinach were an added plus my new favorite everynowandagain pasty is the peanut butter and jelly holy guacamole they have taken the traditional pbj and slapped it in the face sent it home to it s momma then added some refinement and some ooeygooey yummy in my tummy goodygoody gumdrops to it holy toledo the banana is welcomed added bonus to be honest i have yet to try a pasty there that i do not like this is a great thing yet can be very unhelpful when trying to figure out what to have for lunch or dinner maybe someone can help me i do not know what is in their salad dressing for their basic green salad but it is amazing their garlic roasted potatoes and mushy peas are so yummy as well they have my two drink requirements on tap guinness and boddingtons also they have duvel which is one of my favorite belgian beers for a moderate price they have great happy hour drink specials including car bombs you ca nt beat that dine in take out or delivery it does nt matter how you get it just get it make sure that if you order their green salad you get extra dressing  you will be happy that you did
almost as ghetto as the original carolina s lrb north lrb as we call it rrb rrb offers amazing and cheap mexican foodthe greasy cheesy kindand their tortillas are the best in town their signature lrb red rrb hot sauce is great but not many people know you can get tasty green hot sauce or tastier pico for a small fee

like mastro s city hall always great food and service similar menu as city hall just more emphasis on seafood if it makes a difference to anyone i find that city hall draws a slightly younger crowd lrb s rrb than ocean club bon appetite
so there is a strong possibility that i am in love this place is great i walked in thinking that i was just going to have a couple of drinks but when i saw that they had an individual starter and sides section in the menu i got excited so that means that i can try several different items without completely breaking the bank  i started with the sun dried tomato risotto omg loved it will go back for that i was actually full after that but indulged and ordered another one i also ordered that and the mac and cheese too the mac and cheese was good but i really wanted to lick my bowl after the risotto my husband ordered the switch burger that was recommended by our wonderful server delicious it s at the top of my list for best burgers they have a great happy hour with certain drinks at less than and an appetizer option for a discounted price our server josh was great and the ambiance was contemporary too i will be bringing my friends here
best pizza in the east valley chicago style pizza with a unique sweet sauce a must try you will be addicted after the first bite if you re looking to eat at home you can either take a cooked pizza home or they ll make the pizza for you to take it home and cook there seating can be an issue during rush hours can be cramped at times it s a small shop in an industrial park and they have found some creative ways to do seating can be hard to find but if you re on the right street keep looking you ll get there
what a delicious delightful surprise our scottsdale friends kept telling us we d be having breakfast at their favorite restaurant tc eggington s and now i know why they saved it for our last morning nothing else compares clean cute cafe atmosphere lrb i loved the chicken wire on the menu rrb a huge menu of possibilities lrb all unusual and yummy sounding rrb good service and homebaked goodness down to the english muffin i ordered the opear grenache omelette based on recommendations from my friends and the waiter here s the description how sweet it is a subtle mix of bosc pear slices melted havarti cheese sliced almonds and bacon offer you an extraordinary rich flavor you re never experienced they were right and it was so huge that i could nt finish it though i really wanted to lrb next time i ll order the reduced size  two instead of three eggs i did nt know i could or that i should rrb everyone at the table was happy with their order my only regret is that i do nt live close enough to try all of their omelettes
trick or treat get drunk and go to the museum they wo nt kick you out if you get in before the doors lock i have to agree wif everyone else that the tours are spectacular the place is great to bring out of town visitors for a real dry taste of the desert the operators of the museum are smarty pants sometimes though etc
this place has great food the setup there is awesome and the service is outstanding the pizza s are awesome and there taco salad is amazing
always good food and service but yet another reason to love this place there is a young man who works here always friendly and works hard while we were there an older couple came in with the lady being in a wheelchair this kid ran across the dining area to hold the door and get them comfortably seated you just do nt see that stuff any more attitude and the desire to make someone happy is a big indicator of the work ethic of a person and this young man is awesome
by far this is my favorite mojo location the tempe marketplace is a beautiful setting for my favorite dessert  it s beside the water spouts and a group of couches and it s nice to take a break and relax there the only downside to this location is that it always smells almost too clean  kind of like a hospital it can be unappealing when you first walk in and it s very very noticeable of course i d rather it be clean than unsanitary but it s a little weird oh and lion king is playing weird  rrb
came for brunch on a saturday morning the room was light and comfortable and very inviting the first thing that i noticed was the hip bartender with the mowhawk and tattoos it was fantastic they only serve beer and wine so our brunch beverages were beers and mimosas they have vegetarian options as well as dishes with meat they have a very simple eggs and bacon dish for we also ordered walnut toast which comes with triple creme brie and a housemade berry jam this too was only and they kept bringing us refills of it stars for delicious and inexpensive food such a friendly server and for being generous with the portions
according to the adage fools rush in where angels fear to tread and so only after my girlfriend and i suddenly found ourselves the new owners of a week old shihtzu puppy at pm on saturday did we begin to realize the magnitude of our predicament wag n wash is on our drive home so we called them to see if they were still open and they informed us that they would be closing at we hurried there hoping we could make it before they closed our experience was topnotch although we got there a few minutes before nobody raised an eyebrow employees at many places would resent having to help a customer who showed up at closing time and would rush that customer not here there were four employees cleaning and tidying up they all came over to meet our new family addition and were genuinely happy to help us put together a puppy starter kit their suggestions were particularly helpful to me as a firsttime dog owner even the groomer who was still there came out to meet her and offered up a sanitary clipping and wash on sunday we commented several times about how much harder it would have been to have gotten through the first night if the good folks at wag n wash had nt been so awesome so we went back
went with a party of people who were game for mixing and matching sharing appetizers and what not great  got to try a ton of things on the menu everything was really good nothing mediocre or crappy i had the duck an unusual choice but wanted to get something that no one else ordered fabulous the crab cakes were great the cheese and fruit platter was pretty good wifey had the beef tenderloin exceptional and so on even the mussels were great service was fair to good atmosphere was just ok not too hip of a place and i am not a fan of dining outside but it seemed to work for us at this place overall it s rare i give out the coveted five star rating but this place had a lot going for it  creative menu neat setting and much more try it out
i have been to several boston market locations and this one is my favorite the lobby is always clean and the staff is friendly prices can be a bit high on some items but worth the money if you want a good homestyle cooked meal without doing all the work
after reading the reviews i just had to check out the cherryblossom noodle cafe i was not disappointed what a crazy little place i went with my brother and a friend i had the yakisoba lrb noodles with vegetable and sauce rrb my brother had the udon noodle soup with tofu and his friend has the tuna all three were such different dishes yet were all wonderful we could nt stop raving about the flavor who knew noodles could be so magical or tofu so flavorful  the service was actually quite wonderful our waitress helped guide us to the meals we would like she also brought us the cool appetizer bread basket banana bread little cinnamon toasts and rolls she also helped up each pick a desert rrb just an odd little place japanese and italian noodles in a restaurant with plenty an eiffel tower decoration and a bright red british phone booth  check it out rrb
i love big for shoes  buy almost all of mine here this location in particular is one of the real good ones lrb some stores are smaller rrb  my most recent purchase was a backup pair of their rugged exposure journey plus shoes i ve been buying these here at big lrb sometimes with velcro straps sometimes with laces rrb for a number of years  always for on sale the regular price is these shoes are comfortable right out of the box  last me a couple of years wearing them pretty much every day most of the men s shoes here run about but are on sale about one week out of three for as little as jeromy h joined me here today  bought himself a pair of killer  work boots for great place here  rrb rrb
i love lux they play the best music lrb the xx tonight rrb their coffee and tea is always the best lrb my personal favorites are quattro con panne and the velvet rrb their baked goods are so genuinely great and now the new food and atmosphere are simply making me want to live and die here i wish it were closer to me since i live in tempe but i ll gladly make the lightrail trek at least once a week for my fix
the place is a typical japanese style cafe that caters to young women in tokyo who want to get some away time from men i like how it s divided and the brick facing giving more privacy to catch those stolen moments of my away time that i am so fond of the food is surprisingly good yet cheap and with great variety many western dishes are available as well as sushi udon and cold summer noodles they should drop the noodles part from their name as their are only about noodle dishes on the menu the place puts out a bread basket of fresh baked breads and banana bread before your food arrives kirin asahi sapporo and sapporo on tap is available for beer drinkers as well as the usual cheap wines great for lunch and nice for during the week dinners owned and operated by actual japanese people a rarity in phoenix i ca nt believe i have been going there so much recently i guess it s become my favorite joint that is not part of some largecorporatehohumloudplace
i visited simply dentistry a week ago in september for a routine cleaning i must say that i was extremely impressed with the staff the office and quality of care the receptionist greeted me and walked me around the office which allowed me to briefly meet the hygienist staff as well as see how clean and orderly the office was what was really cool was the small office area that the staff allowed the patients to use to check email or even facebook so if you get to the office early you can use this area now for the service my dental hygienist i believe was julie she was extremely thorough in examining and cleaning my teeth she asked good questions about my dental history and while performing my cleaning she would routinely stop to ask if i was ok keep in mind that i do nt have a dental phobia but i thought the gesture was nice considering others that may lastly dr tran was very cool she went over my xrays asked questions about my past dental hygiene and offered suggestions for future care the office visit was no more than hour and was very pleasant oh ca nt forget to mention the flat screen televisions mounted to the ceiling so that you can watch tv and become completely distracted during your service which makes it easy on you and no doubt the hygienist last note dr tran was listed as one of phoenix top dentist which was one of the main attributes i used to pick a dentist considering that i was new to the area
heaven that is all i have to say
i ve always wanted a family friendly jeweler esp if my at the time boyfriend was going to buy me an engagement ring it means so much to me to have the true customer service when buying fine jewelry someone i can trust and when i found this place one day while i was at cvs i knew i had found a gem lrb pun intended rrb peggy really made me and my now finance feel like we were family she helped him pick out my fabulous ring and answer every single one of his questions i m so proud to tell everyone where we got the ring from because i think everyone should know about this place if your looking for great jewelry with a warm smile head on over they are so excited to help you

this place is always excellent it s the closest to the food i ve had in china that i ve eaten in all of phoenix particular favorite is the preserved egg if your lucky you can get them to serve it to you sliced like is done in china though it s good in their tofu dish as well they used to offer chinese and americanized chinese on the same menu but now if you wish the chinese version of dishes you need to request the chinese menu
never ever a bad meal here great staff salads wings and thin succulently tasty pizza throw in a couple of meat balls swimming in sauce and melted motz and you have a night that you will actually miss until you eat there again i love sitting at the bar here the employees will always give you a great recommendation on things to try and their local beer that they serve goes really well with whatever you order i m taking my parent s here when they fly in this friday
i love hawaiian food and only found this place thanks to yelp i have driven by hundreds of times and did nt know it was there the service was awesome i asked for a little help and the wonderful lady behind the counter offered tons of advice she was incredibly passionate about the food and raved that they had the best food around i instantly loved the place and i had nt even taken a bite yet i ordered the bulkogi thanks to the yelpers reviews and they were right the fresh grilled taste and perfect korean bbq marinade put this over the top also their macpotato salad was amazing with hot sauce my wife ordered the laulau pork place and the lady was right this was some of the best i d ever had one suggestion ask for terriyaki sauce or something to go with the pork though it was perfectly cooked and seasoned it needed something to put it over the top i m going back to try the short ribs asap check this place out a gem
this is a scottsdale icon old fashioned icecream parlor set in old town scottsdale it s always busy here not your fancy place and not a commercial establishment if you like local restaurants that have family appeal you ll love the sugar bowl
this is how it works u go inside and sit down the plates start to roll in and you pay for whatever u eat most plates are stuff peppers were goood must try i paid under for two ppl i want to go again it was ready
excellent food large variety and great service lobster broiled and sweetened to perfection the molten choc filled cake was an awesome end to dinner expensive but to be expected for having great seafood in middle of desert there were two waiters for my family of and the service was impeccable very expensive but if you want to eat something special be treated special and for special occasions this is the place
i love south mountain okay lover moment aside what do you want to do   hike  cool tons of trails for ya from easy to hard  bike  road or mountain we got both for ya mtn goes from flat very fast trails to very very technical xc rides to some killer downhillvert stuff road has great views and one sundaymo they shut road down to motors so get a wide open road all to yourself  views  heck yes you ll have to hike a bit if you want distance but if you re looking for nature  tons here and plenty of places to get away from ppl traffic also to have a very quiet place to sit and think funny thing about south is it seems almost everybody has their own favorite place to go while there the low flat trails get a little busy but that s easy stuff if you want to be alone work a little bit and you get away from  of the traffic everybody seems to have a secret spot too they like to hike and get away i ve got one that my buddy and i know of that when we get up there there s a point at which we keep going and we ve only seen like other ppl go that far back into the canyons so it s always a very peaceful run and can even look down onto the main trails and watch people down there too south is great i need to mess around more on the west side of the mountain but i live in ahwatukee so i m on the east side and just ride over there they do close some of the lesser known trails from time to time to get the wildlife back in and get some growth back in and other than once getting lost on a close trail i ve never had issues the park rangers i ve met there are always nice always asking how the trails were and making sure ppl are safe probably not the smartest idea but i love to run when there s a storm rolling in just love going out there and thinking and being alone
if you ve never had or even heard of bingsoo you need to check this place out i have two friends who were constantly bantering about bingsoo and this fresco place i was excited when i found out it was so close to my house if you ve never heard of it this is how it goes down it s a layer of shaved ice then you have your choice of ice cream or ff frozen yogurt your choice of fresh fruit off the menu lrb apples strawberry mango banana kiwi and many others rrb and then your choice of sauce which is a fruit puree of either strawberry kiwi or mango and honey you mix it all together and there you have it a somewhat healthy dessert they even have a frequent bingsoo buyers card  rrb this place is nt just all about the bingsoo though they have a menu of fresh sandwiches and fruit juices too
this was an amazing experience that takes dedication committment passion and love lilke a fine cook uses the freshest ingredients in their meal preparation what you put into it is what you get out this was the most physically demanding and mentally challenging event i have ever participated in in the end it was all well worth it in fact i look forward to the next one the event was well run and extremely organized the crowd support was amazing and motivational i look forward to volunteering the future to help the next iron athletes achieve their goals the day was the hottest day in az to date at degrees for the year and had mph winds this made the finish line even more sweet of the or so athletes we saw a percent attrition rate of people who did nt finish this is one of the worst in ironman history this was no doubt due to the extreme weather conditions in the end of a race like this its not longer about time but rather finishing and pushing through the temorary hardships mentally and physcially i was so elated to have made it to the finish line i did nt even hear the announcer say my name however it did nt matter embracing the medal at the line is like embracing your newborn at birth you hold onto that puppy like your life depends on it and feel so relieved and full of joy that words ca nt even describe the emotion i encourage anyone who is thinking about embarking on an ironman journey to make the first step sign up today and good luck zack
this is where i get my retail therapy why settle for less when i can have the best
one of my favorite places to go they even have crab legs good sushi and real ice cream in gallon buckets it satisfies my sushi chicken and crab cravings this place is pretty good size rather dark but some like that sort of thing rrb
trendy sushi and teppan grill that is priced well for what you get try the sushimi platter and get a spot outside
fantastic espressocoffee really cool atmosphere wish for more food options
what can i say  i am a pig i like men swingin around poles i like to be a voyeur i know they are gay they do not like vagina well they do but not the way i want them too i know i will never make them straight nough said
went here last night when on our last night staying at the hotel valley ho we were able to walk there from the hotel and it was so cute the wait staff were helpful and gracious once we saw how large the pizzas were they accomodated us and split the toppings on each side of the pizza so we got what we wanted i did think the olives were really salty but that s that type of olive we had delicious wine and the bruschetta sampler enjoy people
good food and service could do with a little more variety
delicious and moderately priced service was speedy and the waitress was exceptionally polite and friendly
as soon as i found out we were headed to phoenix this place was at the top of my list the one that i know by heart and i wondered of it really could be as great as i ve read it is for the past few years it was and truly may be the best pizza i ve ever had including ones in naples nyc and chicago never mind that each of those locales has their own particular style and genre bianco s is just simply amazing the antipasto platter was fine roasted peppers and fritatta being the best of it the cauliflower was vastly over roasted and swimming in oil which was disappointing but that still does nt lower my rating i just wish we had ordered pizzas with no starter so that our enjoyment had been further maximized as it was leaving half lrb it is that rich and filling rrb of our biancoverde was truly difficult if we had planned better we could have tried the rosa as well i cry a little on the inside that said believe the hype wait if there is a line make sure you are truly hungry and find your way here completely worth it
i was never expecting to enjoy this place so much when i stayed at the clarendon hotel every time i visited phoenix i had to stop here for breakfast before i went out and did anything everyday not kidding really nice servers and the prices are decent not to mention every time i have ordered nothing tasted premade or not fresh i am a big fan and i support gallo blanco and tell all my friends to try it for brunch if they are in phoenix i put the verde salsa on everything ha ha
i had a slow leak in my driver rear tire recently i took it in yesterday lrb  rrb and the manager was nice enough to advise the shop would be closing soon but would check the tire out anyway i was in and out within minutes the tech that worked on my vehicle described what he did to repair the small leak in the tire everyone was friendly and fast it gets my vote
omg this place is so good i got the torta nortena steak my wife got one of the quesadillas lrb which was the largest one i have ever seen rrb this food is just so freaking awesome the tortas i believe are made fresh every day and maybe even there light and delicious the toppings on the tortas are so simple yet so yummy this is a warning people if you go you will be addicted and you will go back over and over if you go on a weekend plan on waiting as it gets very crowded take out here as well yummy
i have to tell you i had their jerk chicken plate the other night and it was yuuuuummmmmyyy you gotta try it
i went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my bosses it was packed on a friday  we sat at the bar and our cook was fantastic we got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders i had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful the bread used is similar to a pastry dough type but not as sweet the pasty was so filling i could barely finish it my bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty  so we all split it as dessert and it was so good they put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty it s definitely rich and gooey i would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too amazing place
one of the best gay bars in phoenix the bunkhouse perfectly balances the feel of a neighborhood haunt with a large busy bar the space itself is pretty good unpretentious it has everything you want to hang out with friends pool darts pinball machines nice bar enormous private patio the bartenders and manager lrb jeremy rrb are incredible they bust their ass to keep everything running smoothly and i never wait more than a minute or two for a drink considering the crowd they draw this is quite a feat the drinks are good too most every night is a promo underwear night is especially popular and they grill out once or twice a week you can show up around happy hour lounge with friends and get a burger and stay late it tends to attract a slightly older or at least more masculine crowd than some of the trendier spots but with that comes a friendliness and lack of attitude that is just very enjoyable last time i was there a bunch of very young kids on a pub crawl came crashing through before they knew it they were friends with everybody dragged up on stage and spending a lot more time than they had planned on so even if you do nt think it s your scene it s still worth checking out bunkhouse has a parking lot but on busy nights you might want to park in one of the other business parking lots or along the street in the back
authentic travel from little taipei california i m glad that i found this place to satisfy my asian food cravings very solid and decent place
the concept of a seasonal menu is great especially at seasons where they have a weekly seasonal specials menu that changes each week hence the in the name also each menu item is suppose to be portionsize appropriate and cal or less sure butter and olive oil make food taste good but it s nice to eat this and know that healthy meals can be made incredible tasty without the added cooking fat we started by sharing the goat cheese ravioli appetizer and a salad with arugula roasted beets and almonds their drink menu is pretty impressive too with many wine and beer options and mixed cocktails for our main entrees i got the scallops and my man got the trout both were delicious we finished the meal with a sampling of their mini indulgences desserts which are served in a shot glass pf chang s does this too and it s a nice idea you get a little something sweet but it s not this huge heavy dessert at the end our server stephanie was very nice she also took the white bean soup off our bill without any problems when we realized upon arrival to our table that it was cooked with ham lrb which we do nt eat and it was nt mentioned on the menu rrb nice decor inside too slightly rusticcontemporary and a nice open floor plan oh and they validate parking too since you have to pay in the lot out front thanks
i love this place the more i go to it the service is completely out of the ordinary for fast food and now they have something called mexican gumbo holy schneikies it s good ca nt beat the prices either if i had a choice of this place over chipotle i would choose qdoba any day
amazing amazing chocolate croissant got the vanilla bean iced coffee too i love seeing specks of real vanilla bean floating around you must go early for warm chocolate croissants they go fast i am so happy about this place i need to try it for lunch
sonora is wonderfully average you will never be surprised by anything here as when they tell you the beer wo nt be cold because it s casket it wo nt be cold the hot wings are hot the fresh salads are fresh and they always cook things to order and are always accurate lrb mid rare is always mid rare a rarity rrb i love brewhouses so the local brews are delish there s nothing surprisingly good at sonora but i ll choose it over a culinary adventure almost anyday
now they serve lunch and are open mondaysaturday woohoo
this is a great place my fiance and i decided that if we lived anywhere close to phoenix we would be there all the time probably almost every day their website boasts  beers wines sakes  organic brews  wines and offthegrid wine they live up to their boasting keep in mind that she and i could be considered to be beer snobs crossed with beer adventurists the lost leaf filled our need for cool microbrews that we like a lot as well as cool stuff we had never had the bartender with very knowledgeable too which is always a plus in a place like this they have great art on the walls most of which i think is for sale they often have events going on as well when we were there a figure drawing event was happening they also have a poetry open mic live music a dj and a bunch of other stuff it s definitely worth checking out
i like eating alone love it why  two reasons i m an only child and i can appreciate sometimes a solitary existence and two because i can have whatever i want what do i want when i want what i want  in n out those crazy religious zealouts have a menu even a vegetarian like me can feel embarrassed that my mouth is watering for what do i get  same thing every time grilled cheese and animal fries and a small drink how much is it  how much do i love it  this much what are animal fries  they re these beautiful cheese covered sauced enriched sliced potato children good god

i had a funeral today and was told not to worry about buying flowers for it because a few people were sending some when they arrived i felt like there just was not enough and i wanted at least one large nice arrangment but there was no way we could still put in an order so late i just thought i d give it a shot i called up the cottage at am when they opened and asked if they happened to have something suitable we could come and purchase she did nt but she offered to put something together for me and have it ready in minutes for my friend to pick up i could nt believe they would take such a last minute order i thought i would be paying an arm and a leg for doing this but what we got was much less expensive than similiar items online if you could see this very large gorgeous arrangement you would really think it took hours to put together not minutes it is so beautiful and i am still thankful and amazed she would be willing to help us out at the last minute thank you to the cottage
petique is a gem tucked at the end of the biltmore fashion square great pet store for unique pet toys and beds that you ca nt find at your big box pet chains petique offers numerous local products which is always a plus that is only a small part of what makes this place so amazing the pet adoptions is what this store is all about i ca nt tell you how many times we have been at this store and a dog cat or even rabbit is given a second chance with the help of ahs lrb arizona humane society rrb thanks again ahs for everything you do to help our furry friends great store that is so much more

we only came across this place because an acquaintance recommended it to us i ve lived up the street from this place for years and never knew it existed it s quite the hole in the wall and easy to pass by the place was super clean and the owners did a wonderful job serving everyone in a timely manner and being super attentive we felt so taken care of rrb i thought the prices were a little on the high side but when they brought out our meal all i could say was whoah the portion sizes were crazy awesome and my hubby and i could have really split one entree and still had some leftover the food was fresh the meat tender the atmosphere pleasantly divine trips now and i m such a fan d
while they have pretty much the same mix ins as other yogurt stores the thing that sets zoyo apart is the flavors of the yogurt they never cease to amaze us with how wonderful and delicious they are small seating area inside and a decent patio clean and spotless
we love the olive tree we call it  the grill we eat there at least once a week  my littlest one has swim lessons right next door both my picky eaters love eating there we love the chicken kabobs and the chicken shwarma lrb sp  rrb family ran great food we love it
we ate here twice in one week on our spring break vacation first we at there and had the special spinach pizza we do nt eat meat so the idea that there was a special pizza that did nt have meat was fascinating and boy did it deliver on taste super garlicky if you re into that kind of thing kiddo s plain cheese pizza was even good then we ordered a togo super veggie pizza for round two that was delicious as well good service not fancy just go and eat and drink and have a nice time
this is absolutely by far one of my favorite places to eat everything is prepared healthy and is absolutely delicious i ca nt wait for their ahwatukee location to open i have been asking for an ahwatukee location for some time and finally my dreams have come true thanks pita jungle ps the spicy chicken wrap is one of my favorites but everything i have ever tried is good
everything about the food and beer are amazing i go there all the time but never expect to get great service that s okay though  obviously they re putting their efforts into what counts the food i can never find my server but other than that one of the best places to eat and drink in tempe by far i recommend the salmon blt and the spinach artichoke dip mmmmmm and the raj heaven
absolutely delicious our waitress sam was very tentative it was a wonderful experience
selena and david are awesome owners make sure you buy their kgb deals living social deals and yelp specials
nobody told me about ordering double double animal style but when i caught on to what the locals were doing i jumped right in and have not been able to do it any other way at this nifty retro keeping it simple burger house nobody makes burgers look like the menu picture except here it is a point of pride can we talk for a moment about the fry guy how strong how swift how forceful the spudsplitting slices slipping salined into the vats fresh cut never looked or tasted so good how can i return to the one who has served over xxtrillion customers  and does that vendor count the customers they have disserviced  i wonder but not for long i have to be rejeuvenated as i pass out from brain freeze sipping my fabulous malt by the way you can get up on tap here yup this is a must make a meal whenever you meander near mesa or thereabouts
i came here for a late lunch on a sunday i got a lovely outside table with a beautiful view of the golf course they have a wide selection of beers including some very eclectic brands i ordered the bbq pork sliders and the chile verde both listed as appetizers both were excellent the chile verde had a lovely flavor without needing any fixin a balance of sweet hot sour and salty the bbq pork sliders were on the sweeter side with a lovely slaw providing tartness and crunch just too much to eat for me as always
my boyfriend and i went to hunan after trying a few chinese places in chandler when we called the lady didnt speak very good english so we knew this place would be authentic it definately was authentic we are very very satisfied with everything ive uploaded some pictures we ordered combos and sides cheap huge amounts lrb as shown in pictures rrb and service was kind and satifactory
this place is amazing a definite must for any baker they have every type of pan gizmo or gadget you could ever need at rock bottom prices i like to stock up on cellophane bags and disposable loaf pans lrb those brown paper ones rrb for holiday gift giving sure you can probably find a majority lrb but not all rrb of their items at sur la table but you ll pay more
i stopped here out of shear hunger and had time to kill they just had there grand opening the day before i got there i walked in and the smell of the fresh breads were mind boggling this place is very tiny and very cheerfully decorated and clean the ladies behind the counter were still learning the tricks of the trade very sweetly greeted me and asked me what i like to order they have about different sandwiches posted on a very nice menu board and huge options for coffee and all the breads cakes pies tarts omg drool they will make you any kind of sandwich and hand you more samples than you can shake a stick at i order the turkey and had it on a fresh baked croisant too yummy to explain the green tea was fresh brewed and out of this world if you go remember they are as fast as subway but they will knock your socks off
awesome small little place and worth the wait during the season either get there by pm or after pizza was very flavorful  nice  hot great waitstaff byob but they provide the wine glasses  opener would go back over and over
for some reason i am always shocked when i find a great barbecue restaurant in the western united states this is your typical smoked meat in a plastic basket type place the food was well cooked and very tasty the portions are large and they even offered me another refill for the road i thought that was pretty classy if you re passing through wickenburg try this place out
awesome dive bar recently opened and turned what was a quiet place into a thriving fun bar go see the girls all dressed up play poker or pool and enjoy some great drink specials
never disappoints  love the cheeseburger with grilled onions and their sauce
my absolutely most favoriteest place for lunch i m not really into wraps  so that s not what i eat here but it s the best greek salad lrb get it with chicken rrb i have ever had and when i worked down there i used to get it  times per week split it in half and have the second half for lunch the next day oh and the other thing i am way picky about chicken i usually end up picking off half the chicken from any salad because i m a purist if you re anything like me you ll have no problem here not to mention this is the only place i know that carries zevia  soft drinks made with the herb stevia  no sugar no artificial ms cancercausing crapola
great place to go when i need a quick and healthy lunch i get the baja salad w  mahi on it healthy green lettuce lots of fish dressing on the side i also enjoy the ahi tacos great lunch deal
slightly crappy start to this little adventure walking in my phone got lrb what the manfriend likes to call rrb glendale custom akai dropped in walking in and shattered the screen i have insurance and its only a phone so i got over it quick we walked in and were greeted by an incredibly sweet older lady who later explained she stopped in for a meal one day and next thing she knew she had a hostess job in her spare time thenif that was nt charming enough we look out the window and see an older john deere tractor with a grandpa and his grandson just driving to breakfast literally they could have served me dog food at this point but the charm had already won me over and yetthe food was oober yummy very home cooked feel made me a bit homesick the staff was awesomely friendly and the atmosphere was fun and light very small town feel being a small town girl i fell in love will be back hopefully driving in on a john deere
after what seemed like forever i was on southwest after a month hiatus from arizona the flight was delayed in atlanta but the gate crew tried their best to lighten the mood apologizing constantly and then throwing some jokes around the flight was packed yet the flight attendants were friendly and helpful the entire trip they even walked up and down the aisle with ipads talking to customers and mapping out their connections in phx as usual you can get plenty of free snacks and drinks and the attendants are consistently up and down the aisles asking if you need anything at one point one of the flight attendants just started singing on the pa i thought it was hilarious even though she did nt sing that well great to have a fun flight home
of course they are no la madeliene but if you are looking for some good croissants this is the place to be i love love love their croissants but which bakery s croissants do i not love  hmm but i do love theirs i have had the almond croissant the almond and chocolate croissant and finally today when we went there i had the chocolate croissant it was just freaking amazing that s all i can say lrb they run out of the chocolate almond croissants pretty quickly so go early if you want some rrb i have also had lunch here before some mediterranean sandwich stuff the portion is very small compared to the price their macaroons look crazy and funky have not tried them yet but plan on doing so next time i almost gave them stars because their hours they are open are very weird but its okay i will compromise essence bakery they only use butter imported from normandy in their croissants wow
i never thought i would say you should got to apache junction for your coffee but you should i regular different starbucks locations bc i go there to write and do other stuff i do nt want to do at home lrb where i work rrb this location is the best one it s huge seriously it s huge i think the manager told me it s the biggest in the state or maybe it s the highest selling one or both probably both i m staring at the massive patio right now as i sit inside on their cushy chairs lrb this one also has the most comfortable soft chairs rrb and i m counting about tables on the patio lrb ca nt see them all rrb it has a latticetype patio cover and of course it has misters all starbucks locations seem to have a staff with friendliness super powers where they know your name and they know your drink if you re a regular but this particular staff even tops the rest i ve noticed them prompting their new employees on the names and drinks of the customers there are a lot of tables and it s an open environment  not cramped like some starbucks locations there s also a lot of talented regulars here who are possibly too eager to be your friend if you become a regular too that could be a plus or a minus depending on who you are  rrb
despite the drab exterior of the building there was no bs over the phone and really inexpensive windshield chip repair professional and attentive service at the front counter done in minutes maybe less i was shopping next door
i have been going to champs salon now for years it s amazing how time flies originally i started going to champs to have my nails done lrb by mandy evans rrb she came highly recommended  and is a lot of fun within the year  i also started having my hair professional colored and cut lrb by jt  also excellent rrb now a days our whole family has some kind of service there  whether it be cuts or hair shaves for the men or color and nails for the girls both mandy and jt have done so much work for us onsite and off for my daugthers wedding jt came to the hotel and did everyones hair for them for my wedding  jt trained mandy and my daughter how to style it lrb wedding was a in rocky point rrb mandy then came down and styled my hair and my flowergirls  along with generally assisting with everything over the past years we have gotten to know everyone at champs most of the girls here have been here for longer then this even they are very professional and concientious they stay up to date with new processes and products the worse i can say is that it is sometimes hard to get a last minute appointment because mandy and jt are so busy  but i find that it works better to schedule in advance and not spur of the moment all their work is excellent and guaranteed satisfaction
made the journey again to enjoy what still has to be my favorite thai food in the valley lrb i look forward to someone providing a suggestion to prove me wrong rrb it had been more than months since my last visit and i still daydreamed of their thai toast appetizer i pretty much made that my dinner and ordered the duck and pineapple curry lrb again rrb and with the exception of a few spoons worth i took it home to enjoy later and enjoy it i did it s out of the way for many lrb since i moved downtown it is more of a journey rrb and located in a shady old strip mall do nt let any of that deter you from trying it out many of my fellow yelpers know the beauty of a place is not always a good judge of character for the great food you can get
went early to north for the new year s eve special menu rd time dining here they did not have to have great service or food on a yearly event but as with the previous meals it was outstanding hubby had the misto fritto they always do the crisp calamari perfect enough just to make a special trip for it i had the beef carpaccio buttery and flavorful the apple cider pork tenderloin was tender moist and it was a huge portion my hubby was stuffed but did not stop eating until it was all gone oink i had the scallops always a favorite of mine they usually have it on the menu and often in a variation as a special we both had the hazelnut chocolate cake sinfully rich we were both too full to eat but a bite and finished at home for the new year s countdown we really enjoy our dining at north and have been very fortunate at several other fox restaurants
really great really fresh food definitely on the pricey side but if you do nt go too often it s not a huge deal outdoor seating is nice and the fallwinterspring weather in phoenix makes it really pleasant they are nt open in the summer fyi
i guess over easy is one of those places people either love or hate fortunately i love it we decided to make the trek to phoenix for breakfast recently and chose over easy because it is close to my office and i thought it looked cool when i d driven by located in remodeled taco bell it s a funky space with a diverse crowd so unscottsdale that s one of the things i love about over easy the food is pretty darn good too yes i agree the food it a little on the high side but for me it s worth it i loved the french toast with carmelized bananas give over easy a try and let us know what you think

great bar i have been here twice now and have no complaints the bar tender lrb chris rrb is outstanding and nice to look at he is great at keeping the patrons happy and keeping the conversation going the lounge also carries my favorite gin lrb hendrick s rrb which is not extraordinarily common in bars around here the atmosphere is pleasant and the people here always seem friendly it has never been crowded when i am there which is fine by me i am almost afraid to give such an outstanding review in fear of it becoming popular because i like this little gem that christina p introduced me to just the way it is
cibo surprisingly earning stars from me this is overall a great place to eat the setting it is on the corner of the street on th ave near downtown phoenix it is in a house that s right someone s house turned into a charming little restaurant where the front yard has tons of little tables weaved around trees and patio heaters in the winter they also have a beautiful set up with the lights hung from the trees that gives you that intimate feel as soon as the sun hides out for the night on weekends you ll get some live music calm accoustic music from nothing but reguar joe s outside on a picnic table entertaining the old fashion way with guitars and other instruments to soothe you into the delicious food that awaits inside as soon as you walk in you notice the chef through a small opening a glimpse into where the magic happens he is there on weekends for sure and yes you want to eat there while he is present the food it was a busy friday night for us and it was fast not too fast we did not feel rushed out of there the pizza s had that wood fire smell i grew up with it reminded me of the pies this italian man used to serve out of his van lrb which had a wood fire oven in it rrb when i was a child the best pizza in the world somehow cibo duplicated that taste and brought back some childhood memories just like remy s ratatouille did for igor do nt miss the buratta appertizer big enough to share with or people at the cheese was simply bliss if you love good fresh mozzarella you ve had nothing yet this buffalo moz is outstanding creamy and perfectly balanced with grilled bread and prosciutto you will not be sorry the burschetta trio is also a very nice size portion it does come in six pieces for only that s a bargain if you have the buratta and then taste the mozzerella on the bruschetta you will find it bland and the mozerella will taste like a cheaper cheese so eat the bruschetta first now to the pizze just triumphant do nt look any further this has what you need just keep your order simple and you will not dissapointed the service folks there sound italian from the greetings to pronouncing things the correct way to us butcher the beautiful language everything sounds and taste better when you know how it is meant to be pronouced they were friendly and efficient nothing more nothing less italians know that if you want to sit there for a while while you eat go for it do nt miss the burarta app and of course the pizzas sit outside and enjoy the neighborhood feeling of dining in your front lawn remember if you want to try some of the best mozzerella you ve ever tasted call in advance to see if they have burrata in that week they can run out of this little piece of heaven cibo you are a strong restaurant a gem keep up the good food and the tradition that flows in your menu
omg a dream come true happy happy happy

a smile when you walk in the door my neighborhood rubio s is a true neighborhood place to eat there is seldom a time when you do nt get a smile when you walk in the door the staff is always happy and upbeat the management is always on the ball but takes time out to ask how your day is going and how the food was when we think of dashing out for lunch rubio s is the first name on our lips and then our lips ca nt wait to taste the food
i want to give an elegant smile a good review based on earlier reviews i can relate to the appointment scheduling i ve been taking my children there for almost years now and have had many rescheduling conflicts or just showing up for appointments and being notified that the hygienist has left or the appointment was not for that day waste of gas yes but hey with the service you receive it makes up for it i have a year old son with asbergers and he can be a challenge to do work on they are true professionals in dealing with him as long as you take your time and notify him about what your about to do he will let you if you do nt answer his questions or keep him up to date with whats going on he will fight you tooth and nail i wish i knew the hygentist name who worked with him recently she is so cute and small and she handled my son like a pro she talked to him the whole time held his hand when needed and kept his spirits up the whole time during the procedure the care you receive there is truly professional i recently went in after years of not seeing a dentist and they did nt lecture me nor did they try to push procedures on me that i did nt need the office is beautiful and well maintained i would recommend this dentist office to my friends and family thank you for your patience and understanding with my son same post from other review sites i m not a troll real review just did nt want to write over and over again just copied and pasted
ok i totally messed up here i recently gave lisa g s a good review but felt like my post could ve been written differently and still conveyed the same message basically she deserved better long story short instead of updating the post i deleted which now i m realizing was probably the wrong thing to do i am sorry and if i need to make up for this mistake in some way please message me and i will anyway her restaurant is so good which is why this rewrite is so important to me just like the song  i m every woman lisa g s is every restaurant lisa g s can be intimate or lisa g s can be the chill hang out with friends either way you ll get great food and attentive friendly service this is my  go to place whenever i have friends in town for a visit they always fall in love with the little bungalow style home contemporary furnishings and lisa g s signature bowl of meatballs in marinara sauce accompanied with thick slices of parmesan cheese and bread on the side while the meatballs are my favorite i ve tried most everything on the menu and the food is consistently delicious including the drinks have you ever tasted the caipirinha lrb pronounced kaipureenya rrb  if not you should  it s the perfect summery cocktail in the three years i ve lived here i ve never had a bad experience at the restaurant and that speaks volumes looking for a place to go on a date  lisa g s need a cool midtown phoenix restaurant for drinks and appetizers  lisa g s do nt care either way and just want good food  lisa g s everybody together  i m every woman ps  lisa g s is light rail convenient on th st between thomas and mcdowell if you re not up for walking blocks or taking a bus it s a very easy bike ride

staff was quick and efficient food was delicious
i went here at about am and ordered a large pizza some bbq hot bone in wings and the cheezy bread everything was delicious the cheezy bread was the best i ve had in a while and they even have flavored crust
we have nt done a breakfast in some time and we noticed this new joint next to grassroots the online menu looked good so it was time for a try excellent and plentiful menu options the coffee is very good for restaurant coffee and they keep it full they also passed the water glass test by actually leaving a carafe of water on the table like my wife says they also leave a gigantic bottle of syrup on the table because everyone knows things need to be plentiful for breakfast bacon coffee syrup i had the eggs verde on corn tortillas they were excellently runny and just enough spice to give it flavor without burning my mouth my wife had the brioche french toast and it was fluffy on the inside crispy on the outside just right our friends each had a breakfast burrito and had great things to say about it as well our server was friendly and attentitive without being overbearing the food is obviously good because there was quite a wait on a sunday morning should nt all these people be in church  looking for a new great breakfast place  butters might be your new place
every time we go to this location the servers and staff are friendly even the managers walk around asking how everything is the food is always fantastic we love our prime rib and they always have delicious cuts perfectly seasoned and cooked the sides are wonderful too we ll continue to go here for our steak fix mmmmmm
what a wonderful dining experience as my wife and i celebrated years of marriage at this upscale italian restaurant we opted for the monday night three course chefs special with the wine paring there was a bit of mixup as the internet price lrb pp rrb did not reflecrt the price increase after their move to the new location however after a short discussion the internet price was honored after the complimentary bruchetta our first wine was presented to us  a lovely chianti blend that introduced our first course the first course had two very different offerings a wonderful mushroom sauce was served over polenta  this was my favorite the other offering in the first course was traditional insalata caprese  mozzarella local tomatoes and basil both of these dishes were perfect the second course was preceded by a local tuscany red wine that was a blend of grapes this pasta course was highlighted by a delicious white seven cheese ravioli complimented with a red sausage and marinara pasta dish all of their pastas are home made and were cooked to perfection the ravioli was my favorite the main course consisted of two fillets of a mediterranean fish that was a member of the monk fish family it was served with a yummy garlic sauce and accented by perfectly mashed white potatoes dressed with fresh basil the evening was romantic and the service was just right we had a wonderful dining experience in this anniversary stopover in scottsdale
the salsa bar alone would make this place phenomenal our favs were the salsa strawberry and the salsa cilantro my only advise for this place would be to just order one taco al a carte because we had so much chips due to the quality of the salsa we were stuffed the horchata is home made and the best i ve ever had they top it with cinnamon pecans strawberries  cantaloupe it sounds weird but it was very good they also use extremely fresh crisp cabbage on their tacos it was very impressive my boyfriend had the pork shoulder quesa which is actually a fried quesadilla and that was also very very very good we will be back my only complaint is that i ordered two different tacos  got two of the same tacos but it was still very delicious  we will go back to try anything else that sounded good
i was introduced to dicks one sunday morning and instantly fell in love ehm um i meant fell in love with dick s hideaway not that there is anything wrong with falling in love with dicks nevermind i love mexicanstyle food for breakfast why ca nt eggs be served with beans tortillas and green chile sauce  i have had the carne adovado with eggs and the huevos ranchers both are excellent served with tortillas potatoes beans and a healthy serving of cheese it has always come out piping hot on really cool pewtertype plates i love pewter plates makes me feel like a knight or something it is not the biggest of places and sitting can be sparse depending on time of week and time of day sundays they offer mimosas it is truly a hideaway it is hidden on the west side of th st in a strip mall under cover of some viney type plant i have used type thing times now anyway give this place a shot it is awesome
i was introduced to this place by groupon and could nt say no because i am such a big fan of margaritas it was a great place for lunch with some friends it s probably great for dinner with a few friends too service was okay not spectacular but acceptable i would nt recommend walking in with a large group unless you called ahead lrb if you can rrb because they do nt seem like they could quickly get stuff situated for you i had a breaded lobster taco shredded beef taco and prickly pear margarita my friend had the same but with a pomrita instead of the prickly pear margarita all the margaritas here are made with fresh ingredients lrb freshsqueezed limes etc rrb and not some mixes that have been sitting in bottles in the fridge forever i honestly like the pomrita better than the prickly pear margarita but they were both very good and quite large however the margaritas are really expensive i would recommend coming during happy hour because they are all halfprice during happy hour plus appetizers are halfprice then too and on mondays the house margarita is only all day long i ll definitely be back for some happy hour margaritas and on a monday off as for the tacos the breaded lobster taco was really disappointing the sauce they put on it did nt pair that well with the fried lobster and the pieces of lobster were overcooked and a bit too chewydry for my tastes however the shredded beef taco was amazing after i started eating the shredded beef taco i knew i would be coming back for more of them it s just a classic shredded beef taco with the classic trimmings in a crunchy taco shell lrb the shell seemed like it was fried very close to when i ate it yet was nt oily and they did nt salt it rrb but they must be doing something a little different because it was just too damn good to sum up i will be back and definitely recommend this place but if you want to drink margaritas with some of those awesome shredded beef tacos i would stick to happy hour because the prices are pretty steep  edit just found out from a fellow yelper that they have shredded beef tacos on tuesdays that just moved it from stars to in my book and i will probably spend way too many tuesdays here thanks lindsey
this is an adorable little gallery located in the middle of nowhere downtown phoenix my art teacher friend got fixated on bringing me here when she heard me complaining about phoenix being chain hell lrb and thanks to her and yelp i do nt believe that anymore rrb i think she chose wisely as i loved this little space it was a nice place to stop and check out and then of course we had lunch at the attached city bakery a perfect activity for a halfday of school hooray creativity and uniqueness

i have lived in los angeles for over years and visited phoenix on a househunting trip i made the mistake of eating at ra lrb gilbert az rrb the night prior and was having second thoughts of moving to the area that is until i ate at hiro what a relief real japanese sushi in the middle of the desert where other scottsdale sushi places distract you with unnecessary sauces or overly loud music at hiro the fish speak for themselves recommend yellow tail and salmon nigiri  spicy ribbon roll try orion beer lrb did you know the us versions of kirinsapporoasahi are all not brewed in japan  do nt believe me  read the label rrb plan to try next arizona roll  okinawa noodles i will be moving to chandler but will gladly make the drive here for all my sushi needs
just when i thought i would nt find a coffee shop that was nt a starbucks i saw the swirly letters of lola beckoning to me like elegant welcoming fingers i just knew that there would be caffeinated delights waiting for me behind the glass door i have nt had an iced coffee since october it s been a long cold winter here in kc and for me this means copious amounts of hot coffee being that in phoenix it was in the s i was happy to be able to have the taste of spring in an iced americano with two raw sugars they make a damn good cup here plus the barista is super nice even when inundated with non drip coffee orders i had to take it to go but i loved the cozy rustic environment there s one large communal white wooden table and then a bunch of smaller wood tables throughout the shop with metal chairs that conjure up images of a s school house when i was there the last week of january they had a mesmerizing photography exhibit with several enormous prints that i m not going to even try explaining lrb i uploaded several pics rrb i have a strong feeling if i lived in phoenix this would be my goto coffee shop for work meetings or just hanging out and of course getting that perfect cup to go
i tired they chicken smash burger woohoo love it crispy chicken lrb not too think not too thick rrb but perfectly crispy i ordered the build your own egg bun crispy chicken mayo and swiss cheese hello mama the smash fries were good the staff is always friendly
i love this place i am not vegan but i must say the food here is great i have been back several times and each time the food is delicious
wow can you get lost in this place i have driven by this place so many times and always wanted to stop wish i would have stopped months ago this place has so many cool pieces of furniture most of which is made on the premise urban southwest has numerous rooms that are set up with tables seating and accessories great way to get ideas nick was extremely helpful in how they build their product and how they can custom build anything for you the furniture is a little more than most places but that is understandable with most everything custom made will be stopping by here again the next time i am in need of a table thanks nick
this place is awesome i ve never been to anything like it if you are in the mood for meet then this is the place for you even if you are nt they have an amazing salad bar make sure not to fill up on salad though as you wont be disappointed by the selection of meats that await you
went here on the basis of the reviews on this site for our anniversary lrb thanks gabi rrb it was a perfect choice from the reservation process through the parking to the live band playing just outside the beginning of the evening was perfect once inside the ambience was excellent their was an intimacy to the venue which was for fear of being redundent excellent the hosts were friendly and attentive and our server scott was wonderful and the food wow we actually ordered two of the specials and they were amazing my wife had a pasta dish in a lobster sauce which was perfect thought she was going to lick her plate at the end i had the ground steak gnocchi which was cooked to perfection both were simply delicious they had a very nice wine selection lrb we had the prosecco rrb and the espresso which topped the evening off was again perfect this is definitely on my short list of the best restaurants in phoenix
quite simply some of the most authentic straightforward mexican food i ve ever had i plan on making it a priority to stop here every time i m in town from now on
i was looking for a butcher and i am so glad i found this place the bacon is soooooo good i also asked for some thick cut pork chops which i stuffed with fontina cheese for new years eve they were so tender i made my decision and wo nt look back this place is my new meat shop ca nt wait to return to try their steaks and brisket also looking forward to seeing them at the downtown farmer s market no more aj s for me ps  i love the way they package the meat great for freezer or fridge update one year later december still going to the meat shop i ordered some meatballs for the first time they look so good making spaghetti n meatballs for dinner lrb i did nt have to do all the work of making meatballs rrb check out my pictures yelpers

tha spot has some really good bbq the know how to do home cooking you need to try the corn on the cob macarroni and cheese pulled pork and dont forget the smoked hot wings everything was great we will be there again soon
this is far and away my favorite steakhouse in phoenix i have eaten here dozens of times with my wife my friends my family and even a private function i scheduled here for my sales force at our national sales conference this is my first stop with guests from out of town and the restaurant has never done anything but exceed expectations the prices are far less than many of the elite steakhouses in town and the steaks are on par or better the service is impeccable i always request donna a server who has been there for many years and is a true professonal she knows the menu and knows her customers the staff goes out of their way to make you feel at home one of the many things that i love about dc s is the fact that they still give you a full meal with your steak salad potato and usually onion strings are all standard with the price of the steak you also receive a plate of chopped liver and homemade bagel chips at your table how refreshing in a world where salads are now extras and sides are all ala carte at top steakhouses my personal favorite is the bonein ribeye and when ordering beef at dc s you should always request the charcrust the smoky blackened crust is a unique touch and when topped with a roquefort butter lrb you also need to request this rrb i really dont think it can be beat i ve had a few other entrees but i will never order anything other than this steak again the others were all good but the ribeye is in a league of its own some extra addons that you may want to try lrb although you really dont need them rrb are the shrimp dejonge lrb like a scampi but far better rrb baked onion soup and creamy cole slaw i am serious  order the creamy cole slaw just to try it it s fantastic the creamed spinach is also very unique it s not like traditional creamed spinach more of a gratin with gooey strings of cheese we get it every time  i think it s about last what more can you say about the memorabilia on the walls  if you love sports this is your church i still take the time to wander around and always find something new very rarely have i eaten here and not been in the presence of some sort of sports celebrity bud selig mike dantoni and willie mays just to name a few during spring training it will be hectic and you need to expect that this may be the most popular restaurant in phoenix in the month of march make reservations far in advance and you will be glad you did
i stop here every monday night and negate two hours of spinning and yoga by indulging in mexican comfort food my wife swears by the carne asado tacos  the cheese enchiladas ring my bell although i phone in my order the parking lot is always an adventure however the one night a young hispanic girl celebrating her birthday in the restaurant s limited outdoor sitting area insisted i come over for a glass of milk and slice of her cake negated all the encounters with strange transients
my daughter and i stopped there on saturday and loved it this is the place to find very unusual home decorating items lrb and more jewelry garden decor rrb two of the buildings are open and filled with the most wonderful finds i ca nt wait until the third building is open as it will be filled with more stuff you wo nt be disappointed this home decor boutique is much needed in the vast phoenix arena of boring runofthemill samesame stores it s about time the shopping started to improve around here i think they just opened in feb of
small seating area long wait bathroom was in motel next door but the food is excellent definitely worth the wait good prices currently my favorite breakfast experience in downtown phoenix

i ve been to a lot of places for sushi in the valley but this is the best period
took some clients here for a business dinner after reading some reviews from other yelpers the meal was jaw dropping to all of us started with a seafood tower which featured some excellent fresh tasting selections continued with one of the best caesar salads i ve ever tasted then a great bonein ribeye i highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes as a side everyone else reported high marks on their entrees  i also tried another person s scallops entree unbelievably good if i ever return would probably choose that as main course bottom line i dont think you can go wrong here we ordered a lot of food and all of it was stellar
since moving to arizona i have found it difficult to find mom and pop shops in the east valley imagine my delight when a coworker directed me to the bread basket this is a quaint privately owned bakery that has excellent customer service and delivers a fantastic product my husband and i chose this bakery to make our wedding cake and we were not disappointed we ordered a three tier square cake it was a marble cake with fresh raspberry filling no fruit preserves allowed it was delicious and beautiful exactly what we had wanted one of the owners brenda delivered the cake to our venue herself since then we order a miniature version of our cake on every anniversary and continue to enjoy the baking bonanza at the bread basket
what a wonderful little gem tucked away in mesa the husband and i tried a few different yoga studios to find just the right instructor atmosphere and personal attention we found that and a whole lot more at inside the bungalow our instructor is personable welcoming and makes yoga truly a meditative practice the studio itself is warm and inviting  a wonderful place to spend a saturday stretching while living in the now i m not a coffee drinker but the cafe offers the best hot chocolate i ve had best enjoyed on the outdoor patio area love this place
wow this place deserves the great reviews i m from out of town and was visiting this week la condesa is close to the airport so allow yourself an extra hour and go try it i had the shark taco and the cochonita pork taco excellent the pork had a strong tangy flavor to it the pickled onions on top kind of had a strange taste the shark was beer battered and very tender crispy on the outside great tastes on both the salsa bar is impressive with done really unique styles of salsa some even have pecan flavor in them what  i also had a horchata which is a sweet rice milk you can get it plain or with pecans and fruit impressive but if you get the one with the pecans in it do nt try to drink it with a straw i wish we had a place as great as this where i live i d eat there weekly lots of creative items
best wings ever
this is the best gelato outside of italy well maybe inside too since the owners are transplants there are so many flavors here it is unbelievable service and gelato are always great you get what you pay for worth every cent
this place is a gem the butter bars are the best ever not too rich so it makes your stomach ill but perfect taste and miles after i left wished i would have gotten more chocolate filled was best ever too
my new favorite restaurant i heard a lot about this place from friends and decided that i had to try it i had the butternut squash cannelloni with mushrooms and brussel sprouts on top of it it was the best i ever had at first i thought it was a small portion however it filled me up fast and was so fresh and tasty i also had a double chocolate stout and a beer from kona hawaii both were great and the chocolate beer had a great chocolate aftertaste my boyfriend had the fried chicken and it was glazed with a delicious and sweet honey spread and was a very large meal he had two local beers that he enjoyed the waiter was very friendly and made great recommendations he was fantastic there was also live entertaining music great for a friday night for dessert we shared the apple monkey bread lrb which is cooked fresh rrb and served with ice cream it was delicious i will definitely be back
this was one of my favorite meals on my day trip to az and nm i m not really a beer person but loved the huge selection and appropriate glassware they let us have a taste of a new brew on a slow fri afternoon at happy hour hh got you a good choice of beers for and plus we had a card for a free pretzel and i loved it no need for the cheese sauce lrb rrb with all the excellent mustards they serve and i thought the spicy brat w  root beer onions was great not dry at all i liked the roll too which lots of people seem to quibble with maybe being in the hot sun and having a couple crappy snacks at the state fair colored my view but i loved brat haus and they served a yummy huckleberry lemonade at the old town farmer s market sat morning
for a wendy s i really like this one everyone is always really nice to me and the store is super clean no complaints also these chains need to start posting their hours
pei wei s has nothing on the fabulous food at totts the menu is awesome  try anything the owner young is such a nice man and will always help you understand the menu or make recommendations in fact one time we told him we wished a certain dish was spicier lrb we really like hotttt food rrb and he told us to just ask next time we were in and they would make it spicier everything on the menu is fabulous but some of my favorites are sweet and pungent chicken  all time favorite bourban chicken twins pork
always wanted to stop in and see what was the big hype about i do nt do a lot of make up or nails but now that i am older and have that need to buy a certain shampoo to keep my locks looking shinny i found this is a good place to get it i signed up for the discount card for coupons and mailers and i bought my shampoo and conditioner prices were better than expected and now that i know they have what i want i will be back good news they got them everywhere even in las vegas so i do not need to go far
best yelp event ever this was amazing enough said but not really it deserves more than that i honestly had such a great time not only was the food absolutely delicious  beef short ribs i will be dreaming of you tonight  but the whole experience was tremendous the staff was great and incredibly friendly and attentive the wine glasses were never empty the manager of the restaurant and the general manager of the complex were there and made sure everyone was happy and had a good time they really know how to put on a good event i ca nt wait to go to ipic and try out another one of tanzy s amazing dishes beforehand
when it comes to food and service houstons is as consistent as it gets this hillstone group restaurant should teach fox restaurant concepts a thing or two about this notion anywho i just wanted to let all houstons soup fans know that they just changed the sunday soup from mexico city style to mushroom artichoke   i m personally very disappointed with the removal of this favorite however i love mushrooms and artichokes this soup is two thumbs up bon appetite
dinner is always good but i love brio for lunch they have a short rib sandwich that i crave you always feel like life is good when you sit down at brio the service is good and the food is amazing enjoy
i highly recommend az body therapy the owner mariya has been my massage therapist for almost years now i have followed her to her new location which is conveniently located at rd avenue and northern she if flexible and works with your hours for scheduled appts even to walkins i ve tried other therapist in the past but no one can tailor to my needs better she listens to your needs and focuses on your requests if you enjoy a deep tissue massage then this is the place to go lrb warning for deep tissue massages rrb make sure you let her know and speak up on the pressure because she can really get in there and work those musclesknots let me tell you when you pay for a deep tissue massage this is what you will get it is well worth your money peeps mariya can certainly adjust to your needs from a relaxing firm swedish to a deep tissue massage this is also one place you can go and actually feel like you ve walked away getting all those knots worked out and not someone lightly tickling  touching your back or problem areas this is also a very professional establishment please keep in mind if you are looking to go to a spa and sip on some fruit water and sit in a quiet room with a big fancy robe and pay over per hour only to feel like you are asking yourself did i even get a massage then this is not the place for you if you are looking to pay a decent price starting at and up for an hour massage tailored to your needspains while walking away feeling relaxed and pain free then az body therapy is definitely the place to go i would highly recommend az body therapy to anyone looking to walk away feeling relaxed and pain free in a professional establishment with affordable pricing
nice staff thoughtful technicians accommodating staff flawless service prices commensurate with service level we like the a lot
hands down one of my favorite places to grab a bite or a cocktail awesome bartenders super friendly wait staff fantastic location way to go guys
i have trust issues i have as far back as i can remember when i first read about the light rail coming all those years ago and everyone was hyping it like it was the nd coming i did nt buy it i wanted to but i could nt i have always been a firm believer in the if it sounds too good to be true it probably is mentality even after i moved to midtown from n scottsdale specifically for the downtown community combined with the light rail just a short while ago i still was nt sure it was going to work out a nice idea but just may not take lrb i have issues i know rrb rrb but then came wednesday night wednesday night consisted of a little mini happy hour followed by the suns game at that was it trust issues out the freakin window the light rail is the shit i could nt believe what a geek i turned into i felt like a year old at disneyworld for the first time i finally understood what all the fuss was about the cars are clean comfy and everyone else on there is just as geeked out as you are and i ca nt explain the incredible feeling of knowing that my car was nowhere in my general vicinity i was nt going to be stuck in my parking structure for minutes after the game i was nt going to be followed the entire way home by sherriff joe s personal motorcycle stalkers and it felt really freaking good to all the skeptics out there like me give it up do nt waste your time just surrender to the inevitability that the light rail truly is a driving force behind the resurgence of the valley you ll be glad you did go find your own version of disneyworld rrb
must have the crispy pork appetizer i have dreams about it
clearly i have been living under a rock for the years that we have lived just a few miles from this gem because we never even knew it existed the husb and i are big breakfast people and back in atl we had tons of breakfast joint options here in north scottsdale  not so much the husb and our friend matt are training for a triathalon and decided that after their bike ride they were going to run down through cave creek at which point myself and matt s wife would meet them for some breakfast at oaks we were seated immediately and glasses of ice water were instantly brought  good thing because the guys were dying of thirst they also had vitamin water which made the husb happy the menu had tons of options for typical diner fare i ordered scrambled egg whites and pancakes lrb my weakness rrb husb asked for eggs and a grilled chicken breast which was nt on the menu but they were happy to oblige the food was so delicious that i actually got kind of nostalgic for jersey and the manalapan diner on route i judge a breakfast place by their eggs and i was not disappointed one bit my egg whites were light and fluffy and not the least bit greasy husb said that his chicken breast was perfect as well our friends were very happy with their meals as well top it off with the fact that oaks is inexpensive and my sunday was made we will be back  soon rrb
wow this is my favorite restaurant the food is delicious everytime and the service is great highly recommended eat at orange table if you like tasty yummy food rrb
as far as gas stations go this one is turning into one of my favorites i have nt tried the car wash but the service here is really friendly and the gas prices are lower than other places around lrb especially if you pay cash rrb it s also near the at baseline so it s convenient on top of everything else if you need to gas up and go
joe s diner is a hidden local gem everything is made there  on a recent visit i had breakfast there the pancakes rock the eggs were cooked perfectly and served with some very tasty bacon service is prompt and friendly great locally owned place for lunch or breakfast
i like this place for breakfast friendly service cute decor

i have to say that the gspot has the best gelato that i have had in the valley it has a comfortable setting with chairs and sofas and the staff actually seem to enjoy their jobs reasonably priced and not too crowded with a great selection of flavors
this place is the absolute best it s got such a great ambiance and it s a fun homey little place to eat at if you do nt know where it is it s easy to miss but i m sure that s part of its charm i never deviate from the veggie quesadillas because they are the absolute best quesadillas i have ever had i m sure you ca nt go wrong with choosing anything on the menu they have allday happy hour on saturdays which you just ca nt beat the staff is really nice and will remember you if you go there enough it s got a great vibe and i will always recommend it i ll definitely be heading back soon
as far as i know i m the only person in this town that has a dish named after them i could be wrong but i m pretty sure i m right i mean i m always right by now if you read my reviews you know that i am vegan and i do nt eat gluten this makes dining out quite an issue at times especially for breakfastbrunch i really wanted to hit up the vig uptown for brunch because i like it as a happy hour spot the space is incredible it is within a bike ride from my house and i love the original vig but alas there was nothing on the menu to accommodate me i gently mentioned in person and a few times on facebook that having some sort of tofu scrambler would really improve their menu they listened they created they named lrb after me rrb we stopped by for brunch this past sunday for the dishes debut and got a personal hello from tucker he was excited because they had already sold ten amber scramblers that morning and it is nt even officially on the menu yet i m already a star so whats the verdict on the amber scrambler  amazing seriously the thing that really sets this apart from other scrambler dishes is sun dried tomatoes they bring such a delicious flavor it certainly does nt hurt that it comes with their signature guac and a side of pico i ll be here every weekend for the delicious dish and the fresh squeezed mimosas if you know whats good for you you will too
this is a must try the atmosphere was great and the food was even better the chef was personable and chatted with us about the food and his background every thing we ordered was delicious i ca nt wait to try again
centennial is the way used car buying should be centennial has a no hassle business model  offers fair pricing amazing customer service and a true no pressure experience my girlfriend purchased a truck from them last year and it was an infinitely better experience than the other dealerships we d dealt with previous when i recently needed a car i went back to eric wilson at centennial  while they did nt have what i wanted on the lot they spent a couple weeks searching for me unfortunately they were nt able to find what i wanted in the timeframe i needed lrb ended up having to go out of state to find it rrb  but they did nt try to pressure me into taking a different car or exceed my budget truly excellent people to deal with and the next time i need a car it ll be my first stop
lux is my favorite everything here is fantastic all the barista s know your drink and have a welcome smile to see you pastries are made on site ample in selection and are delicious if you think you re too chubby for cake there s usually fresh fruit hanging around and yogurt in the mornings free wifi and free people watching are a bonus to this dimly lit and cozy atmosphere

the meritage steakhouse is a hidden gem in phoenix it is perfectly located for anyone in the west valley right off the in the jw marriot desert ridge resort prices were reasonable for a quality steakhouse and the meritage did not dissapoint great service attentive but not intrusive management did the rounds which is always a nice touch first of all the steak was cooked to temp which is always a great way to impress me right out of the gates they nailed it the wedge salad was delicious the beef carpacio appetizer was awesome what else can i say  the meal was great from start to finish i would add the meritage to your short list of places to check out it is a great alternative to flemings ruth chris mortons etc nice outdoor dining options too enjoy tony
this place is awesome i ve used them regularly for over a year and never had anything come back other than how it should ie no holes or stains their prices are the lowest in the area too they also have a really convenient lrb and free rrb service where you can drop off all your clothes after hours on top of all that the people are really nice this was a star no brainer
they have some of the oddest things but if you re anything like me the authenticity of the products keeps me coming back the seafood is some of the best and freshest around
we just took a hospital tour here because my wife and i are planning on delivering our baby there i m not too familiar with hospitals but i think it s really cool that they even offer a tour so that you can familiarize yourself with the whole process they also offer a ton of parental classes which we plan on taking and i love how they have it set up to where your baby never leaves your sight after delivery
wow just had a really great experience here with azher in the personal care department she was so helpful she spent a good amount of time with me talking about the products lrb i absolutely adore body products rrb i actually found a new cleanser and sunscreen due to her advice i usually avoid whole foods because i find it to be too pricey but i needed to pick up a tea that i knew i would find here when i walked in the first thing i saw was yummy goat milk soaps in dozens of flavors if you do nt know goat milk soap is as nourishing as it gets i was able to compare this whole foods to the one in tempe and am happy to report that this one is so much better there is no comparison there were so many goodies here and the sample of chocolate mousse with blueberry strawberry raspberry and blackberry won me over people are so nice around these parts
this is a beautiful preserve in the middle of one of gilbert s extensively developed residential areas it s a great place to hike bike or just stroll and enjoy the tranquility and the beauty of nature a trail system loops around water ranch lake and seven ponds and the availability of water results in the maintenance of a more lush vegetative community than you would expect in this region the lake ponds and abundance of vegetation also provides habitat for a lot of wildlife and indeed this is a bird watcher s paradise there are picnic areas and restrooms and children can play in the play area or dig for fossils in the dino dig area my friend and i are thankful that the preserve allows dogs lrb as long as they are on a leash rrb and even provides mutt mitts for cleaning up
so we have been here probably  times and this is the first time i am reviewing mellow i love this place i believe that mellow has the best beer selection in town with both rotating local and national micro brews and of course the happy hour is half off all of the beer and other alcohol selection so basically you can get a large oz beer for the pizza is also amazing my personal favorite is the thai dye pizza which has sweet chili sauce and chicken curry sounds crazy but it is super good i ve also had the meat pizza buffalo chicken pizza and they were all good also during happy hour all of the appetizers are half off and all are great you ca nt beat it
best cheesesteaks in the valley closest to philly i ve found
i like this one better than the other one that is all oh also i would like to try the bottle and bruschetta sometime this spring i think beautiful outdoorish bar
went there for a quick lunch and had it in minutes and there service was great
if i could transcribe the sounds of a happy stomach to written word it would probably be spelled mastro s i would classify mastro s as the ultimate of steakhouses with cuts so prime and tender that they will still fall off the bone the next day when you take your leftovers out of the fridge from the insanely good assorted bread basket lrb do nt eat too much or you will spoil your dinner rrb to the shrimp cocktail that are so big you d swear they were on the barry bonds regiment of steroids to steaks that come out on degree sizzling plates there is happiness at every turn here live a little eat at mastro s
sad that this place closed last yr we would go to this place all the time mr kinfolk was super nice he would always give us extra food and idk about you but im glad to get up and fill my own drink so it can be full all the time great bbq and great place sad this place is closed

consistency and highquality this is malee s on main they do nt skimp on the vegetables and the when you ask for hot  you get hot no ifs ands or buts about it their tofu is always prepared with excellence and the chicken never dry or tasteless all the curries shine but the arizona heat wave lrb red curry rrb is fabuloso the restaurant itself is cozy too low ceilings fun and interesting table placement  malee s uses the uniqueness of their space to their full advantage i ve never felt like i ve intruded on anyone s conversation by accident nor have i ever felt it happen to me the lunch special is a good deal however it can be busy so make sure you have the time i ve been to malee s on several occasions when a group comes in at or and then i can tell their upset because they re food does nt come out with the speed of a drive up window this always bothers me good food takes time and malee s is most definetly very good  so allow them the time to prepare it you ll be glad you did 
my doctor recommended me to karri after i asked her about her glowing skin that was about six years ago and i have been happily getting treatments ever since karri is professional conscientious and very straightforward and uptodate about skincare i rarely have a skin issue now and when i do it s amazing how she can get in there and take care of it i seriously wish i had known her years earlier as others mention she is also fun and energetic and i get great advice from her about products and other treatments i wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone seeking serious clinical skincare
this has been a staple since i moved to phoenix and has never disappointed from the service which is always informative patient lrb and kind as my dining companion is always ponderous over the menu rrb and thorough no detail is left out the food is consistent flavorful and diverse best black bean soup in town i recently revisited after a brief hiatus and discovered to my delight their wedge salad that i donned with beef tenderloin it easily disappeared in record time i only stopped to take sips of my filthy vodka martini i am always reminded that this place can fit any occasion from a romantic dinner to a night out with friends they are always eager to accommodate brunch is nice and mellow as well if you re ever looking for a neighborhood staple this should be in your rotation
great food and service
i remember when those silver little disks came out and i held tightly onto my beautiful vinyl record collection thinking that i would never go over to the dark side that was the cd with it s tiny art and expensive machine that required it i felt the same way about my typewriter and my sixtyeight mustang but alas time changes everything i remember waking up with my mom and dad standing over me and thinking someone had died actually a piece of my heart died because someone had broken into my car and stole my cd case with over of my most beloved cds many of them bought in europe on the black market of bootleg concerts lrb why why why did i leave that case in the car  rrb i felt the sharp sting of karma even though i did nt have any sting in my collection but maybe the pixies entire european adventures in the late eighties if i step into a best buy i feel overwhelmed and forget what i am looking for and usually the twenty plus years i have on the person i finally track down renders our music speak completely incompatible i love good music and by good i mean whatever sounds good to me and dario seems to have my taste down even if it is not his own i ca nt whistle a tune or even whistle for that matter but i can explain to dario he plays his idea of what i want and  of the time i love it and play it until i drive everyone in the house crazy and then i go back and start all over again people complain about price i m guessing if you love fast food and walmart this place may not be to your interest lrb i m not judging rrb i just think customer service is a lost art and that it has value lrb no not value menu value as in i will pay extra rrb i like that they sell tickets to music acts i want to see lrb bowerbirds and st vincent here i come rrb so i love this store
love their pizza salad and wine for two deal sooo delicious
really expensive but worth it
the place has been cleaned up lately which is nice but the real draw are the fish taco s it s the only thing i get there they are so good i m afraid anything else just could nt compare put some extra cilantro a squeeze of lime and some tapatio hot sauce on them and you wo nt be let down it s best to go there for lunch and get the tacoholic special
hands up best sandwich in town but you do not need me to tell you that the reason i am slapping down stars is for the unexpected exceptional service i needed to order a few sandwiches for work last week on the fly and of course everyone voted for vermont sandwich company it was around am and they did not open until which was the time my starving coworkers were expecting me to feed them i pressed my luck and gave them a ring and to my surprise i was greeted by a friendly voice helpful suggestions and most importantly fresh and ready lunch for fifteen with a am pickup a couple great catered platters of miscellaneous quartered sammies  chips thank you vermont sandwich for not being too hip or hungover to take my order you now have another devoted follower
this is one of the first places i think i ve ever eaten at in arizona and after all these years i keep coming back if you re from the chicago area you ve gotta give it a try don carson took what worked in the windy city and brought it to the valley the place is decorated with all sorts of sports gear but you do nt feel like your in a sports bar it definitely has a classy vibe to it the menu is pretty extensive for a rib spot and there s always a good chance you may catch a pro athlete or two having dinner at don and charlie s lrb especially during spring training rrb the ribs are fantastic not the best i ve ever had but there sure is no reason to complain they re a little messy but there s not too much sauce on them every meal comes with creamy or deli coleslaw and a potato or broccoli just enjoy it s wonderful food
tired of paying dealer service prices for possibly shabby service  then it s time to call eurotechs specializing in mini cooper and jaguar repairs i had my mini in for an alternator replacement not only was the repair finished quickly it was also cheaper than the dealer charged for the same service not only did my repair get taken care of jerry also gave me a list of items that should be repaired fairly soon his list made sense included the installation price and was reasonably priced helpful clean and affordable if you own a mini in or around phoenix eurotechs should be your shop of choice

when i came to phoenix from nj one of the things that shocked me the most was the complete lack of south american and caribbean cuisine until now i m colombian so when i looked over the menu and found such familiar foods as patacones and bandeja paisa colombianas and batidas de guanabana i felt like i was home dont expect fast service there is one waiter it really is a mom  pop run establishment no small talk while we were there he took our order and off he went the prices were reasonable and they had a lot of fun sodainca cola and colombiana which are pretty hard to find here patacones lrb fried plantain rrb were deeeeelisssshhh just like you can find at any latin restaurant back east all in all fantastic food great menu items and no nonsense service tasty and we ll be back
this wendy s is right by paradise valley mall it has a completely revamped look which is awesome i would recommend trying the cheesey chedderburgers on the dollar menu they are so great plus they re on the dollar menu hello  they are really fast and friendly there they also have those cool looking soda machines if you like that kind of thing which i do you get to choose different flavors of coke you would like it s just really cool
we are not foodies we do nt go out often but this place exceeded our expectations we went here for our year anniversary made our reservations online thru their website and mentioned that it was our anniversary and we would prefer a table away from the live music we had a wonderful dinner there was an anniversary card on the table from the restaurant and rose petals we had the jumbo gulf shrimp cocktail for starters the fuji apple salad and chilean sea bass  the fresh catch halibut for entrees with a side of broccolini we topped it off with the godiva chocolate cake dessert our server was rocco he was really attentive and very nice we ca nt stop talking about how good the food was the great service and when we are returning
the most unusual botanical garden i ve been to it will make a desert lover out of anyone so many species of blooming cacti and agave lrb so that s where tequila comes from rrb the herb garden was surprisingly diverse it was great to finally see chaparral upclose in the flesh never knew there are so many species of birds in the desert they are so happily singing atop the cacti really neat to see a roadrunner and the speed definitely lives up to the reputation even the little prairie dogs were cute popping in and out of their burrows these gardens took my by surprise and i ve instantly fallen in love with it
crazy jim s probably has the best calamari salad ever i ve been here times already and always with my good friend sage this holeinthewall joint serves up some outstanding greek fare it s a small family owned restaurant serving delicious food with a friendly smile i m not too crazy about the parking lot being too close to the dumpster but the food and service is really good
for some reason this particular location is better than others i think it may be due to the fact that it s a very busy location and they ve got their system for serving a ton of people down like a well oiled machine our food is consistent here always tastes the same and cooked perfectly service is great we do nt go to olive garden anymore unless it s this particular one
this studio is awesome they offer great classes for all ages and the instructors are all really good the owner melissa is a teacher and ex cardinal s cheerleader check this place out
nestled amongst all the carnicerias filibertos eribertos davidbertos etcbertos is a little diamond in the rough neighborhood known as maryvale thai is the bombdiggity ok so i have really only ever had one entree lrb even though i ve been there a dozen or so times rrb but still it s delicious i can speak on the chicken pad woonsen flavor flavor flavor the veggies and glass noodles are delicious and the chicken is always tender of course you can order it with beef pork or shrimp as well when my techie friends and i go they always order family style and order different menus and share there have never been any complaints about any of the dishes they have tried however there are a couple of us at the table who are given grief and called stingy because we just do nt like to share lrb mostly because we like our leftovers rrb meaning huge servings i suggest starting off with their veggie spring rolls that are served with a savory sauce for dipping and always get extra rice oh do nt forget the thai tea the place is not too big or too small the owner is also your server bus boy and cashier he is very quiet and soft spoken but very friendly i m lucky enough to work within minutes so maybe next time i ll venture and try something new but that pad woon sen always calls my name
everything here is yummy parking lot gets crazy cuz there is a starbucks in the same parking lot
had to update i have now had the espresso and feel i can go the full on hava went in for a nonfat latte perfecto the girl at the counter was just as nice and sweet as the guy last week and i like that patio tables outside i cant knock the place for where its located that has nothing to do with the service or java or quality so therefore i wont  rrb froth me hava and if im giving stars i love you
i love the gelato from this place the sea salted carmel is ridiculously awesome it is also so great to purchase a pint lrb or bigger rrb to take it home to ration out over the week i ve started branching out to try new flavors but always get a sea salted carmel for the road the location in san tan mall is convenient because i can park just west of the shop and easily pop in and pick up a pint togo if i have unexpected dinner guests and i want to impress them with and easy dessert lrb with the pint you also get extra rolled cookies to put on top rrb
my absolute favorite raspados place so underrated they deserve more attention for the quality taste and love they put in their raspados rrb every flavor is good wont disappoint he carefully layers and packs the ice syrup fruit etc for you it s not the typical raspados that taste like snowcones each syrup flavor has been cooked perfectly with real bits and chunks of whatever fruitnut flavor you get clean environment great hosts  will never get tored of this place
best tasty burger i ever had whenever i get a hunger for a burger i go to zin
i just ca nt believe this restaurant is rated so poorly it is my favorite and i consider myself picky i think they have great cocktails and chips and salsa i always order the same thing chili relleno avocado enchiladas with cream sauce and papas yum i could eat here once a week
i remember when this place use to be located on dobson and southern lrb nw corner rrb and then it grew up to an adult and here it is busy than ever i love coming here when i need to you can practically get anything asian at this place and goya their competition is mekong down the street but i think lee lee is holding its own with its loyal customers and wide variety of sale items i would definitely recommend coming here even if you need meats and vegetables  cheap like most asian markets i ve been to it does have that stintch of weird odor expelling from the walls but after awhile you get use to it rrb they have a filipino section  love it  get some datu puti and silver swan rrb
scott rich is one of the best i have trusted him to finish my sleeves and have been blown away from his work he has taken my business from my tattoo guy that i have had for over years clean studio great work and they always have movies playing to watch while you get your ink done
this place is hidden and hard to find for someone whose not familiar with the area great people great martinis and great customers my favorite bar in town the people who work there have been around for a while they know you by your name and they feel comfortable to shake your hand or give you a hag sofia lauren martini and some oldies are one of my favorite drinks at merc they have another one in ny which i have been there but i prefer the one in phx
delicious pizza tasty salads cold cold beer yes
rosa s is the only mexican place i like in the east valley they serve bajastyle seemingly authentic mexican with fresh ingredients and good service do nt be put off by the almostdead no habla ingles crappy shopping plaza just park in the ample lot and ignore your surroundings i ve been there enough to have settled on a favorite dish the baja shrimp tacos lrb also available in a tasty grilled fish rrb which are amazing the shrimp is always perfect and it s complemented with a nottoosweet pineapple salsa and fresh vegetables i m not a rice and beans fan and the staff has always happily substituted black beans and a grilled cornoffthecob dish i did once have a mistep which might have been more my taste than the food i did nt care for the mango chicken salad the carmelized onions with mango did nt appeal to me even though separately the ingredients were all fine the highlight of rosa s is the green salsa verde that s served with chips as you wait they ll also bring a red tomato salsa to your table but you ll forget about it after you try the green
blazing christmas lights in february  yes this is one of the many reasons i love couch house last night my two girlfriends and i got out of the movies at fashion square and wanted to go grab a drink many places came to mind but we soon decided on the couch house it is in old town but not like the rest of the bars around here a large dirt parking lot right next to the bar makes it very easy to stop by at for a quick drink we settled up to the bar to enjoy pitchers of beer which at most places around here can be the price of one beer as always couch house has a very eclectic crowd ranging from hard core regulars bikers frat guys and random girls like us last night we chatted with many people from the year old man who told my friend that she looked like the best stripper on van bur en or the irish cougar who tried to set up my other friend with a man twice her age and then of course the old asu guys doing shots of tequila over and over again a dive bar with the most entertaining and welcoming crowd cheap beer and blazing christmas lights are all winners in my book
i love coming here for some healthy grocery shopping a quick lunch or to pick up dinner to bring home the staff is always friendly and helpful i also like that they have a huge selection of already made food to make the most of my lunch break
i was the victim of a major home invasion  by crickets they were everywhere making their annoying sounds all night long appearing out of no where on my walls and floors multiplying and overtaking my home i tried several overthecounter bug sprays but none of them worked for long i was desperate then a friend recommended alpha pest control and i m so glad i took her advice alpha took care of the problem quickly and efficiently in no time i was rid of the noisy nasty pests thanks to regular maintenance my place is free of crickets and other nasty crittersl another plus is that the bug spray they use has no chemical odor i highly recommend alpha pest control
this may be my fav spot in phoenix i ve been here for brunch din and drinks and all were fantastic the space is wonderful  a little oasis in the middle of downtown phoenix there s a big outdoor bar and lots of seating lrb both tables for dining and couches for sipping rrb the inside is also charming with a more retro vibe the food is also great they have large menus that use lots of fresh ingredients  very veg friendly for brunch we shared the bananas foster french toast as an appetizer lrb apps at brunch  brilliant rrb delish  very rich and sweet and would be too much for me as a meal but a few bites were perfect i then had the vegetarian omelet sometimes eggs are just eggs but the difference for me is nice fresh addons and this had plenty lrb for this reason i prefer brunch at local breeze to matt s rrb happy hour is also ideal on a nice evening  lots of room for a big group and refreshing mojitos at a good happy hour price dinner was good  if perhaps slightly less memorable i had the chopped salad sans meat and it was tasty and filling a spacious comfortable garden hangout in downtown phoenix with vegfriendly food and good drinks  in
short and easy review place is clean service is friendly environment is relaxed and cool they have a decent build your own salad bar fountian machine for soda short wait times for pizzawings i order their hot wing pizza and have heard their white pizza is amazing boom on my way right now to meet my family here for lunch

this place is phenomenal i had my first visit around halloween and have been back weekly ever since i m a huge fan of kim chee and these folks have nailed it the coffees and teas they have next door are extremely good as well i usually will take some back to the office after lunch living in nyc i used to love to hit st mark s and enjoy some good ramen i figured i had lost that opportunity upon moving here but thanks to republic i m back in business keep up the good food i ll see you guys next week
since going organic and glutenfree i d say trader joe s has absolutely made shopping soo much easier and not a chore with a variety of options and everything clearly labeled and categorized i could nt be happier with my shopping ventures the staff and management have been absolutely friendly and helpful anytime i ve had questions or needed assistance in finding something you can say i m pretty much a neighborhood regular now
i ve been to this location a few times but this was by far the best experience i ve had it was two sundays ago myself and seven friends wanted to watch the early games and get some food and drinks my friend called ahead and made a reservation when we got there we had a big table reserved right in front of all the tvs our waitress was very attentive friendly and quick they had a bunch of beer bucket deals that we all took advantage of and had a great time watching all the games enjoying some beverages and eating some food their breakfast burrito with chorizo was fantastic and it ll keep me coming back see ya next sunday majerle s
very good tour with professional and knowledgeable tour guides horses were great and my yr old felt very comfortable there was also another family with an and yr old and they liked it as well sonoran desert is very pretty we went on am tour so it was nt hot at all very happy you can get off each rider if you book online
after reading other more recent reviews i thought i would update my original review i still feel that this is a great airport i have traveled through here probably  times and i will continue doing so lrb for my job rrb compared to other airports this one is by far the easiest for it s size it seems as though the most common complaint is how far you have to walk i guess that is a fair criticism i actually enjoy the little amount of exercise you get by walking but to each their own
ok first off two pieces of information i use to work here which makes me a bit partial to the store and i am not much of a trade in person yes i hang on to everything i own so i cant rate the store on the trade aspect because of those reasons i give this place a five but the average shopper i would say would rank it about a four the main reason i love bookmans as a shopper may be what some do nt like which is that the place is just everywhere the organized disorganization is part of the stores charm i love to just spend hours searching for hidden treasures with in the orange book shelves it may take more time to shop unlike a borders or barnes and noble but i never come home empty handed the store has a music video and gaming sections that include new stuff such as blue ray dvds to lps yet bookmans really shines when it comes to buying books and kitchy items at a great price everyday there s something new to buy so coming in often is a good idea
amazing food great pricing and awesome customer service great for a sit down meal or grabbing a bagel to go come here at least times a week
matthew gallegos is the best  professional friendly and an expert barber this is the best cut i have had in years i do nt know why the rating on yelp  his prices are extremely low lrb for a cut rrb the atmosphere of his shop is great as well i was in town on business and i m glad i m coming back to phoenix so i can get my hair cut by matthew go see him and you will not be disappointed
go here all the time the cheese quesadilla is amazing service is great too
sometimes i crave durian and my husband will not let me even breathe in his atmosphere if i ve had it let alone buy one from leelee s across the street so i love when lee s has the ice cream and if they do nt i ll get the shake i get all the strange fruit shakes after all i am what nina simone would call a strange fruit  rrb
very very nice family owned bookstore that allows you to trade in your books and buy other books for half price the owners have also recommended many booksauthors to my family over the years i came in today still seeking a book that i have gone to numerous libraries looking for i found a copy on the shelf that was much bigger than an ordinary paperback i asked if they might have any additional copies the owner was so nice and went in the back room not once but twice to find me the book and it s sequel i was so thrilled to have found the books i believe that almost every year they have a book clearance where they sell off many books for only i wo nt be in town for it but if anyone is i recommend checking it out

wow amazing simply amazing when you see a live band normally there might be one or two weak links perhaps the drummer is just average or maybe the guitar player is a bit mushy not so this band the drummer nick can play the skins  the keyboardist johnathan is masterful  the bass player todd is one of the best i ve seen  and there are simply not enough superlatives to describe the lead guitar brian which leaves the two front men caleb and christine this group covers every genre from lady gaga to neil diamond acdc to prince and they do it flawlessly my wife and i sat there and were simply amazed at their quality easily the best live band we ve ever seen at a club i highly recommend them
aside from the macy s on th street in ny this one is my favorite store they carry all my favorite designers especially for work clothes not to mention the shoe department always the hottest selection of pumps there s a tiny ukrainian woman that works in the shoe department i love her she is so patient with me and gives me her two cents as she keeps bringing out the shoes i wanna meet the buyer for this store and become herhis bestie they also have a personal shopper near the women s dressing rooms not that i d ever have the need for one but you might the sales people are always really nice and helpful on a side note i once met this old guy who said he brought janis joplin to this store to buy panties when she did a show here i ve always doubted that story but it never fails that when i go to the lingerie department i tell myself i m standing where the late great janis stood she s one of my all times
do nt let the strip mall exterior fool you the interior is charming and nicely decorated with soft tahi music tinkering in the background this is great authentic thai food its the real deal the spice is rated  and be cautious with the spice level i m originally from south louisiana and i like spicy food and i order mine or i work nearby and lunch is timely and delicious the tom kha and pad thai are wellexecuted classics nice job palee s crown
i love this place the sandwiches are huge and the soups are awesome priced from and up for full sandwiches and for half sandwichsoup combo it can fill up big and small appetites alike i ve had days where i would order the soup and sandwich combo and have just eaten the soup and take home the sandwich to finish off later because i m stuffed from the soup and bread bowl
first of all i have no idea what these bad reviews are of this restaurant i m an excellent cook myself and i know crap a mile away  but this food was excellent we had a  minute wait last saturday night  totally expected surprised it was not longer place was packed server was quick and the food was extremely good i had the chicken mole enchiladas and they were delicious chips were very good  and i do not know what people are complaining about with the salsa it was  different than other mexican restaurants but i think that too is one of the things that sets this restaurant apart  in a good way service was attentive yet unobtrusive i will look forward to returning to frank and lupe s
we were visiting phoenix and i needed to try joe s farm grill after i saw it on ddd we tried the cheeseburger and onion rings i think the burger was the best burger i have ever eaten it had that great chargrilled flavor that i love in a burger and the size was more than i could eat they also have a condiment bar with more choices than i could even imagine the onion rings were the best i have ever eaten also they had a great breading with a hint of rosemary yummy everybody s food around us looked great too i doubt there is a bad item on the menu it s so good we were contiplating driving out of our way to hit it before we went to the airport well worth a trip you will return
we have all been either dragged to the mall or been the one who has dragged someone with them well if you find yourself being dragged to pv mall make an escape to the brookstone store if you can this store has everything you need to walk out feeling amazing massage chairs and tools of every kind which are out and ready to be tested by you i think the main idea of this store is items which will make you life more tolerable do nt pay for someone to massage you in the mall trust me just come here
by far our favorite gem of a restaurant in central phoenix my wife and i are able to share the belt sandwich portion sizes are more than generous here great menu fun environment and fun servers who clearly are there because they want to be compare to some restaurants where it feels like the service is being performed by slaves rrb postinos you rock keep it up
i really like the new renavated hilton it was painted a golden yellow color first we went to the front desk they told us we had hour left to wait so we went to the casita pool it was really warm becuse phoenix gets hot after we went swimming we got back to the lobby to check in then we went to go pick up my two brothers and my mom i wanted to stay in the north pointe becuse it was less crowded but for some reason they put us in the south pointe after that we got to our room it was total change all the furniture was diffrent from the last time we stayed here we went to the other side of the room the bedroom the beds were a change too first we wached some tv after that we went to go eat at hole in the wall restruant they had good menus then we got desert we ate smors they were pretty good at night we went swimming the jacuzzi was really hot then that night we got to the room to get dresed for bed the bed was comfy then i went to sleep the next morning i woke up to get dresed to go to the river ranch they had the lazy river and the big pool in the front of the entrance we got out of the pool after that we went to go wash our clothes at the washing palce after we went washing we got to eat at lantana grii they also had great food then we went to sleep the next morning checked out then we left i would highly recamand this hotel
i love this place they are always busy which is ok because i think it s well worth the wait the coffee shop has a good atmosphere and the outdoor seating is nice they are known for their cupcakes lrb even featured on cupcake wars rrb but i have not tried them yet as for the breakfast i love the san diegan  yum the coffee is good too
i m still in shock and awe that the cardinals are lrb might be rrb a real bonafide team come january i  had  to watch the super bowl just to verify that fact i was once convinced that they were part of some elaborate andy kaufmanesque hoax i had heard of the stanford cardinal i knew that there was a baseball team called the cardinals but football  really  now after their performance in this year s super bowl i m not necessarily convinced of the opposite but i m definitely on board and willing to play along bravo nicely done az
it s now over a year later since my first five star review and this vet s office is better than ever truly ten stars they always call back they care and i would not trust my two girls lrb two dogs rrb with anyone else i highly recommend pecan grove they are like a god send to me thanks pecan grove for being the best i really ca nt say enough good things about this veterinary hospital we just moved here and they were awesome about getting me in asap dr tuttle showed so much compassion to my wonderful dog murray and mayself if you want a place where they understand your love for your pet this is the place i had to make the horrible decision to euthanize my murray lrb he was almost and could nt walk at this point rrb and she made a house call murray hated going to the vet so she came to us there are vets closer to me but i would drive a long way because dr tuttle is so amazing
toasted subs at their best the worst part of eating here is trying to choose one sandwich out of my four or five favorite picks and in the fall when they bring out the soups i can hardly resist ordering the cream corn soup with my meal
excellent love the nachos the mahi mahi tacos and the queso fundito we will definitely be back
guess what vietnamese eat for breakfast  pho fo breakfast and it sits all nice and warm like grandma s oatmeal i am a pho snob i will drive twenty miles to da vang any day but i was at lee lees needing some spices and they were open and i ate pho for breakfast and i was soooo hopeful that it would be good and it was it was right up there the spring rolls were okay i took a look around and everything was looking nice and fresh plus you get to shop for your rice vinegar after your meal win win service was fine but he was just one guy and if more ppl had showed up i would have been waiting for my pho only single issue was no cliantro on the side a small sprinkle in your soup and i am a herb whore i wanted more but go go and eat pho even for breakfast
awesome service and really great prices we just bought our first house and knew that we needed wires run and other odds and ends done they came over crawled around our crawl space hung our chandelier and poof now our house is all electrizied a friend referred us to good guys and they really knew their stuff loved them
best raw vegan food in the valley they are not exclusively raw but do have a half dozen or so raw dishes on the menu daily and do a raw special on fridays the quality of the food is excellent i have eaten here several dozen times and never had anything that was nt good
i enjoyed this so much with my boyfriend we were having issues picking somewhere because i got off around pm and it s hard to find places open late thankfully la bocca was open until am on a saturday when you first walk in it feels very down to earth laid back and kind of artsy i really loved the designs it was interesting to look at the lady who came to our table was very friendly and got our drinks promptly i had the orange blossom martini delicious my boyfriend had something lrb sorry i ca nt remember rrb very strong but refreshing it had the aroma of lime and you can also enjoy the taste of the lime possibly sugar and very strong alcohol the waitress said it had everclear in it and that s why it was so strong we enjoyed the bruschetta pesto pasta and a  make your own pizza the whole reason i love this place is the amazing bruschetta the flavors were so rich and amazingly put together i will definitely be going back here the ambiance drinks food customer service was all great it s not too pricey but if you want to enjoy the bruschetta lrb pick four rrb be ready to dish out buck for that appetizer we did not get to enjoy the deserts but they sounded great maybe next time  rrb my pasta had a strong taste of feta which i did nt mind but the bruschetta stole the show for me i ll be happy to revisit
came here last night after leaving the murder of douches lrb shoutout to ben rrb at loco patron this place was a much needed change from the fratty atmosphere of lp i ve always seen this place when i used to work at pure but never found the time to make it over i m so glad i finally did this place is cute and i m sad the old owners left because i knew them from pure and they were awesome so my friend and hit this place up around because our party of had dwindled to us lrb you can tell who the real alcoholics are rrb this place had a few people in it and we decided to hit up the bar the guy josh was awesome he is my old coworkers roommate and was really friendly i always had a bottle of sunshine in front of me and he made us a variety of shots love when bartenders take the wheel and just do everything they can to get you drunk you were awesome josh i hope to be back here soon
this is my first yelp review i like to read what other people have to say but never really thought to voice my own opinion until i was looking for a new dentist and wished there were more helpful comments so i hope this helps someone who is looking for a good obgyn i was referred to dr eckel by my primary physician when i was years old lrb years ago rrb he is very knowledgeable and professional and i have always felt very comfortable with him he delivered my son in and everything went perfectly even though i have since moved minutes away from the south scottsdale office i still go there for my annual visit and i plan to continue going when we decide to have another baby i sometimes see one of the female nurse practitioners lrb wendy or nancy rrb for my annual exam and they are awesome too
such a hiden gem a must if you live close by want a casual cool bar
i m picky about textures of food that i eat so it is surprising to me that i d like sushi as much as i do i ve eaten sushi all over the place i am confident in saying that i like mikado the best their rolls are good sized lrb some places have really small rolls rrb and taste great the chefs are great too almost every time i ve gone i ve had someone sit next to me that is a regular and swears by mikado sushi so what is the bad  sometimes when you walk in the staff is not super active at seating you if you want to sit at the bar then just walk over and sit down if you want a seat then walk over to the register lrb it is only like feet from the door in plain sight rrb and ask if it is ok if you sit at whatever boothtable you like the staff all works together so when you sit at a table you will be served by all the chefs and all the servers  and thusly you will be tipping all of them collectively so for this reason it really does nt matter where you sit i m not saying to just sit wherever i m just saying be proactive it helps you and it helps them my favorite roll is the crunch roll which you can get for cheap during happy hour lrb until pm rrb during hh i can get  rolls and a tea for about outside of hh it will be more like  also the menu has pictures of all their food lrb well  of their food rrb so you can kind of browse that way too if you like to look at what you are buying so if you want to be waited on hand in foot and have a restaurant that looks like a million dollars then this is not the place for you however if you want good sushi then this is the place if you are curious about something then ask them what they think i see many of the regulars asking all the time what is fresh and good and the chefs will be very honest about what is good and bad and they will orderserve accordingly also the most you come the more you will become family to them you will start to get samples especially if you sit at the bar and chat with the chefs there you have it the best sushi place i ve been too and better yet it is close enough for me to walk to
first timers to this park on an early sunday morning me my bf and our old english bulldogs had a great experience you can choose between the active or passive dog park we choose active but also decided to keep our dogs on leash being our first time and all we were immediately greeted by a woman and her boxers very friendly we walked the perimeter of the park to get our dogs use to being around other dogs and talked to several people along the way we did have a small incident when a dog snapped at our dog but no harm no foul looking forward to bringing the dogs here again
omfg so gooooddddd i love it better than any gelato in san francisco even in n beach lrb italian neighorhood rrb pistachio  roasted almond  tiramisu  stracciatella  hazlenut  the list goes on and on last time i was there they had oatmeal cookie flavor that i think was a special it was surprisingly good this place has definitely been a contributing factor in the pounds i have gained since i have been traveling to phoenix oh well worth it
great food and service
amazing place you will never be dissatisfied i ca nt say enough great things about this place you have to check it out wonderful food reasonable prices excellent service great pizza a true italian restaurant youll love it
i really like this location for home depot it is easy to get to being right off of the freeway when ever i go there is always reasonable parking and enough shopping carts the employees at this location are easy to find in every isle and are beyond friendly and helpful many just stop me to chit chat with me about my baby this to me shows they take an interest in their customers and it makes me feel welcome a good note to say also is they can figure out what a thing a magig is your looking for and never have looked at me like omg we have another stupid women i often bring a picture of what i need and i do not know the names of parts well they treat me respectfully and often laugh with me rather then at me for my frustrations of being construction handicapped the very large selection of items i always find what i am looking for or something that is equal to comparable prices are reasonable for almost all items the do have i feel the best pricing for chlorine for pools one thing i do not like about this location is there is a lot of static in the place i am always in flip flops and tend to drag my feet so if you do this also bring a cloth to wrap your cart handle with otherwise the metal on the cart will shock you this although will not stop me from going back my son however gets a kick out of me jumping from my shock treatments i have not noticed any illegal day laborers hanging out near here as i have read in another persons review this however does not mean they are not there but i have not noted any of them so this has not been an issue for me i do know some other home depot that this is a huge problem at but on that note at least these people are looking for a job trying to support their families weather illegal or not
before i write my review which will be brief i need to include this small disclaimer the owners of this restaruant justin his dad and family are new york football giant fans and i will not hold that against them considering that the giants defeated my new england patriots in super bowl xlii here in phoenix and that was when i met justin at a local sporting goods store before the game my wife and i have eaten there on several occasions before and after the super bowl and i have just one word to say about the food the service and everything else that goes with their store awesome if you dont go there you are missing something and they serve something that you should not miss as i said awesome justin if you read this we will be back soon for more of that great pizza and the fantastic real new york cheesecake
i d have to say that among the restuarants in the tom jetland suite lrb fez ticoz switch rrb ticoz is my favorite because of its dimlylit loungelike quality which provides it a cozier feel than the other two add to that the hypnotic mojito creations and ticoz is one of those places i could spend an entire weekend late afternoon at as long as someone else drives of course the tamales are fantastic and are more similar to corn pudding than to traditional hand rolled tamales if you get them with veggies you ll find that the veggies are a little oddly cut for the dish so i recommend some other topping the beef is fantastic lrb especially in the tacos rrb all in all this is one of my current favorites
great place for sushi and nonsushi lovers i went there my second time today for lunch and it is really easy to get to by car walking or light rail the restaurant is clean and simple with plenty of table even during lunchtime i had the tiger roll lrb shrimp avocado and cucumber rrb and a side of white rice which was perfect for my hunger level my boyfriend s beef teriyaki bowl was very simple lrb rice and beef with sauce rrb but was very tasty haiku grill has a pretty extensive sushi and nonsushi menu and is a good alternative to mill ave for lunch
been a fan of this place since before yelp found it true it is not cheap true the time it takes to get your food is so looooong that you think they forgot about you but they did nt my tip  get your drink  fill it  drink it  refill it  repeat about the nd or rd refill is about the time you can expect to get your food i am either boring or extremely loyal depending on your pov  if i find something that i like  i stick with it if i do nt  i either try something else or never return to that establishment for this place  i get the chickparm with pasta salad it has never let me down since i live in ca  i only get to this place when i visit family  so it is a mustdo when i visit usually  times a year when i do make it here  i eat it up  then usually go home and sleep for a nice hour nap rrb then i can return to visiting with the fam
i lovelovelove green the atmosphere is wonderful and the food even better the people who work here are lovely sweet and very helpful there are far too few vegetarian restaurants in phoenix metro area and this one gets my full support
sushi eye is the best sushi establishment in arizona maybe even the country the staff is super friendly and the food is delicious i live in the bay area now and i still have nt found a sushi restaurant that even comes close love to sushi eye
never been in here physically i have used their services many times via their easy to use website phoenix flower shops is much better than online services that boxup your flowers for shipment  then the recipient has to setup the flowers themselves my girl certainly appreciates their professional delivery service local company great selection reasonable prices and on time delivery httpwwwphoenixflowershopscom
i ll be honest the burger is nt my favorite but i do enjoy the wisconsin cheese curds i hate ordering them because curd is just a weird word to say but i m always happy i say the weird word cuz they are worth it the other unhealthy thing i love here are the shakes they look and taste great the people said hello welcome to delicious as soon as i walked in and they yelled have a great day as i left i just think if you were having a bad day how could this greeting not cheer you up 
i ve never stayed to eat here but always satisfied with my beef or chicken chimichanga others who have been here complained about the utensils  plates being plastic  paper but i ve been to mexican restaurants where plates and utensils were all pretty but food was nt all that i recommend to others to try it out
this review is way overdue and since i am not a regular yelp reviewer i am making an exception to this one i am in love with the quality and range of bruschetta they had at postino figs honey almonds pistachio goat cheese prisciutto and sooo much more bite after bite felt like heaven on earth their creativity with the menu blew me away hip ambiance check originality check scrumptiousness triple check i need to find a place like this in the bay area
i ve had the pleasure of visiting the chandler and tempe locations multiple times for business dinnersand have never been disappointed warm cozy atmosphere not too loud good service and now we can talk about the food yummy cornbread margaritas appetizers and i love the chicken enchiladas
i was skeptical that the desert could possibly be home to one of the country s finest sushi houses after experiencing course after course of great contemporary sushi preparations i can only say wow we ordered the omakase tasting menu lrb decadent version rrb and the chef visited with us to find out our likes and dislikes so that he could prepare a menu to delight we were not disappointed every plate was beautiful and every bite was fantastic the nigiri and sashimi plates melted in our mouths the pork belly was a must have the grilled shishito peppers with dancing bonito flakes was a surprisingly good interlude the tempura lobster  decadent and of course the wagyu beef served with several different salts was amazing service was attentive but not hovering their hani and kudachi cooler cocktails are both delightful this was a twohour journey to remember
ok i waited a while to write a review about this place because i wanted to at least get two visits under my belt before i make any praises or judgements and the verdict is da da the da da well you already know what it is since this is the only restaurant specializing in hot pot here in phoenixchandler maybe all of arizona there really is no other place i can compare it to so i gotta compare it to the hot potshabu shabu restaurants i have visited in l a san gabriel etc compared to the other places i have been this place tops the list the soup broths that they offer are very unique to different asian regions i had the ying yang which is half non spicy traditional chinese herbal broth and half traditional taiwanese ma la spicy herbal broth sometimes these other place would make the ma la broth not edible because there is too much of the numbing spice but here they make it just right they also did not skimp on the herbs used in the broth very flavorful they also offer all their broths vegetarian the second time i was there i tried the spicy lemongras veggie style and is was also very good so tien got the broth down but what about their menu items  three words fresh and top quality all the veggies and mushrooms i ordered were very fresh this is important because with hot potshabu shabu there is no hiding bad or poor quality items the meat selection was also cut perfectly and of top quality comparable to the top shabu restaurants i have been to in cali i ordered the shabu beef lamb and beef tongue the shabu was so tender it basically melted in my mouth in addition the udon i had was also very good and so was everything else i had the two time i was there everything here is a la carte so you can always get something different with each visit all in all i will be back again and again and again keep up the quality and the service and i am sure this place will gain the popularity it deserves
i m notoriously skeptical of any restaurant that resides in some sort of strip mall you immediately lose points off the ambiancecool factor i also am reticent to eat anywhere that does nt serve booze i just feel like the restaurant and i are nt on the same page and its a relationship destined for failure pizza a metro exists if nothing else to blow up my preconceived notions were i to drive by pam a hundred times i d never think about going in but that d be a mistake its actually quite quaint for what it is inside and while they do nt serve booze they re glad to have you bring in your own wine for a modest corking fee lrb there s even a convenience store a few doors down if you re in a pinch and need an emergency bottle rrb and the food was top notch no question authentic italian lrb just like the owner rrb this is the kind of place you can bring someone and have that  look at this undiscovered gem i found smirk on your face the whole time i did nt get a chance to even try the pizza but that s all the more reason to go back
my exboyfriend and longtime friend lives in vegas and has pretty high standards when it comes to dining and entertainment my family has all lived in phx for years but i am a recent transplant from tucson so when we visited in august i had to rely on the people of yelp to assist me in discovering new places for a couple of something foodies with it s central location yummy food and fabulous vibe this spot is now on my list of regular dinner spots it is a houseturnedrestaurant so it s not a spot you will just stumble upon you have to know where you are headed the interior is very tastefully decorated and modern the chefs are creative and offer new menu choices lrb including desserts rrb so you always have something new to try down side is you might not be able to get it next time you come in
someone please confirm or disconfirm this for me but i heard that this particular store was shut down  is this true  i would be very truly upset if that were the case
this is the only place i go to take my car fabulously thorough and hands on this vintage style car wash has a lot of charm the friendly staff and smartly sassy owner makes me feel like part of the family
love this place went there for lunch and george the owner made our greek salad and southwest sandwhich it was amazing even their ice tea was yummy when we were about done eating george came over to our table and asked us how the food was and he was real friendly i would definitely go back there again and maybe see how their breakfast menu is like
this is my favorite mexican place in phoenix it s a small place with seating for probably about  my favorites are fish taco shrimp taco chicken tortilla soup and quesadilla with carne asada salad and burritos are very good too also try the salsas the lady makes fresh daily once you try it you ll be definitely going back it s a little hard to see it driving by
once again this place does not disappoint tonight i took my friend from northern arizona out to dinner we ordered the hummus lrb yummy rrb and i orders the mousaka omfg it came out looking like a beautiful greek lasagna lrb if lasagna was blessed enough to include mashed potatoes and eggplant rrb i was already pretty full from the hummus but just could not stop myself from eating more and more of the mousaka it was simply put perfection my friend had the gyro plate with greek fries and she was also very impressed this place is awesome
i love them too much try to limit my visits to once a month because they are just so darn good fresh i have never gotten bad food here i have always had friendly fast efficient service the prices are right the food is fresh non nonsense straight forward good i know there s probably calories in the meal but plan for the occasion and splurge once in awhile it s better than mcdonalds with a bunch of frozen chemicals
great place i love this one as everyone there is very friendly and better yet readily available to help me find what i need picked up some pavers sod and plants on my last visit everything worked out awesome
i have been here at least times and have never had a complaint the staff is friendly the food is great the atmosphere is lovely my favorites  the lb lavosh and spicy cottage cheese i will continue to come back to local breeze again and again
most of the jb s on the website have been reviewed rather poorly but we think that s a mistake my boyfriend and i visited this last night just to get away from fast food and after reading the reviews on this website we were very nervous about it the first thing that we ordered was the quesadilla and from the first bite we were just blown away it was amazing and that was just the appetizer my boyfriend had the double allamerican cheese burger and i had the club sandwich these are two simple items that usually always taste the same no matter where you go but here you could definitely taste the difference it was fairly inexpensive especially compared to their corporate giant counterparts of denny s and ihop this was our first trip to jb s and situation willing it wo nt be our last it was delicious and it does nt deserve the rap it got on yelp about it
best sushi in town that s usually not saying much if you have ever had sushi outside of az but this place rivals my favorites in san francisco and even holds well compared to my most recent nobu visit
love the tea here i come quite often and suggest others do the same rrb
this was the best feast i have ever had for rand h and i got there at am and they were still serving breakfast so we went in anyway well the breakfast was great different sausages scrambled eggs bacon shit on a shingle omelets made to order ham  pancakes waffles different types of hashbrowns kinds of juice corned beef hash and the list goes on at am they brought out all the lunch stuff which was all the typical golden corral fare the grill was cooking ribs and they were really good we both agreed the lunch was stars and well worth the drive to casa grande so if your real hungry and don  t mined a drive to casa grande then you will love this place
first of all melinda is such an artist with hair whether you want to stay simple or get a little crazy she will create a style and or color that will amaze you and keep you coming back if you read this review you should give her a shot you will not be disappointed if nothing you will wish you found her sooner  rrb one quick thing is that the location noted for this review is incorrect it is the old location the new location is as follows n th st ste phoenix az
service is fast here and drinks are made perfect it s a good airport starbucks
this great breakfast spot is now open on mondays too yum
my grandma recently died of cancer without having any money or plans for afterwards so we picked best funeral from a list a hospice person gave us the building looks really generic and basic on the outside so i was skeptical but the girl we talked to lrb must ve been julia judging by the previous reviews rrb was really sweet and patient with us we could not afford much and were only doing a simple cremation with no memorial service embalming or anything and we were not pressured at all to upgrade or buy anything that we did nt need it was very refreshing the day after the initial consultation my mom and i were allowed to come back and dress my grandma and do her makeup as she would not have been happy to be sent off into the afterlife looking sickly and wearing a hospital gown i was amazed that we were allowed to do this ourselves and it made me so happy i m bothered by current funerary practices where people just hand their loved one over and have nothing to do with caring for them after death so it meant so much to me to be able to give my beloved grandma the final gift of looking pretty on her way out this also gave the rest of my family a chance to see her looking nice and more how she did before she was sick lrb they came back to see her for a couple minutes when we were done with the makeover rrb i know it sounds creepy to do that yourself but it was actually a very joyful experience for my mom and i that would not have been possible without the awesome girls at best funeral they even came in and helped us without us asking and seemed to genuinely enjoy their work and taking care of the deceased thank you so much best funeral for making this awful time a little but better for me and my family
i loved this place my dining partner and i shared a carmelized onion tart then i had the gluten free spaghetti with cauliflower kale and shrimp it was very delicious  wonderful flavors and textures nice service cool people and a very neat space if i lived in phoenix i d go here more often
i used to eat at the chuckbox when i went to school at asu and loved it years later and after living in texas and california i still have nt found a burger that compares to it that is as long as you accept it for what it is a straight nonfancypants burger on a charcoal grill the way a burger should be if you want a fauxbebeef burger with truffle oil and scallions you re in the wrong place if you re easily put off by being shouted at while you dillydally about what kind of cheese you want you re also in the wrong place and while you while you wait for your burger by the grill you can pass the time by trying to decipher the code of little swords and cups that identifies an order it s pretty complex
i have to agree w  becky s and adam k really good middle eastern food good prices  nice staff allaround winner best deal  gyro plate  giant gyro fries and a drink what more can you ask for lrb maybe a bigger sitting area rrb
 convenient  quality produce and food  quick selfcheck out  friendly and helpful staff  excellent markdowns lrb these go quickly rrb  good prices  easy parking

yay for dave and busters my wife took me here for a pre birthday celebration we only intended to stay an hour or so because if you re not careful the spending can rack up at db s before you know it fast forward hours later and we had to pull ourselves away from some skeeball the happy hour specials brought us in they actually have some pretty good drink specials from pm for happy hour i had million dollar margaritas they were very refreshing and were nt at all soppy sweet mixy tasting i thought they jipped me on the tequila until i started my second one and i could feel the delicious tequila buzz hitting my fingertips we split the make your own shrimp soft taco plate a hearty meal with tortillas and an assortment of fixins black beans rice guac sour cream lettuce cheese salsa and shrimp i thought they were darn tasty then off to the arcade where we played video games something we only do at db s thus we lose quite quickly and quite often i love the zombie shoot em ups the race cars and the air hockey my gal loves skee ball probably because i suck at it oh and whackamole scored serious tickets on that there are numerous shoot em up games basketball and tons of those fair games where you try to roll a token into an impossibly difficult contraption in order to knock more tokens into a slot to get more tokens argh it s too difficult to explain in the end you spend about dollars to get tickets in exchange for a glass you could ve simply bought at the store for cents but that s no fun however dave and busters is
i have no earthly clue why i have nt written this review before now although it probably has something to do with my hands being busy shoveling catfish into my mouth i ca nt say enough about how much i love this place i m not much of a fish person but i would smack my mama for some flavors of louisiana fried catfish lrb just kidding mom rrb i m also a huge fan of their shrimp po boys fried shrimp peach cobbler and bread pudding  pretty much everything i ve tried a friend of mine swears there s nothing better than their dunkin catfish lrb served on saturday rrb but i have nt tried it yet if it ai nt broke do nt fix it and i ve been ordering the catfish shrimp and fries for the last year at least tip do nt you dare skip the dinner roll it s delicious and worth every carb

hal is a notre dame grad but i still think he is great he runs a solo office has been practicing for  years and knows his business well he has helped me with business entity and our personal estate plan his fees are reasonable and reflect that fact that he has low overhead and no large corporate entity to support if he can not help you he can point you in the right direction
i absolutely love lola the sangria both red and white are absolutely fantastic the happy hour deal of pitchers is an absolute steal we always enjoy the daily special and the paella my favorite daily special was the shrimp ceviche it was so good we ordered two of them my staple favorite is the chickpeas and spinach a bit of kick in the spice arena really brings that dish together for me desert is a must the thres leches cake is absolutely fantastic you must try it service is never a problem for us i think the staff is fantastic they are never hovering which is pleasant i hate being asked times during the meal if everything is okay if we ever need anything we just wave down any server we see walking by its such a wonderful atmosphere for a date or getting together with friends just know that it is a community dining affair you will be sharing a table with a few strangers its just the style of the place go with it try something new

fable iii used and looks brand new for  oh yeah i ll take it i stumbled upon this place because our little cousin wanted to get a game and he had been here before with his aunt the place was filled with classic games all over the walls and even to play i m guessing classic original games are back and in style again plus they are just fun to try or have a flashback from the s the store is clean open aisles to walk through great prices on the games and the customer service from gary and rich is phenomenal these guys were very nice educated about the games and went out of there way to make everyone happy great job guys rrb all the high star reviews are true this place is so much better than any other gaming place i ve been too my husband loved it too he was a kid in a candy store what a great find i think you should take a trip to this store even if you do nt play get a game as a gift just to experience this place it is something special and unique

during my honeymoon period with this city which was about two weeks long i was taken down to the gardens to see the butterfly exhibit it was amazing they were releasing butterflies and large moths in a netted tent filled with flowers they would perch on various plants and dry their wings by fanning with them hundreds or perhaps thousands of them were in this tent this many butterflies is really hard to describe as it is something that really needs to be seen apart from this special occasion they have cactus and arid plants of every kind if you re new to the desert it is definitely worth the price of admission they also have special events that are supposed to be really wonderful check the website and plan way ahead of time as reservations and tickets sell out fast
after writing about the heard museum i remembered that i had taken some photos from my spring trainingsightseeing  childhood memory trip back to my birthplace phoenix sure enough i had baseball pictures of barry bonds and giants stadium downtown scottsdale pictures clever pictures of me in stupid cowboy hats and some of taliesin west lrb see pictures rrb if you do nt know about taliesin west you are nt alone unless you are a lover of frank lloyd wright which i have been from an early age because my mom and dad both went to school and graduated from arizona state i went to college there too at the age of and mr wright built the auditorium called affectionately the birthday cake so his name was probably one of the first ones i was ever taught in my opinion fl wright is surely america s greatest architect if not the world s greatest i have a fantastic hour pbs special on him that explores his life and work in great depth it s wonderful to pull out from time to time and get reinspired taliesin was his dream home his school and his refuge originally built on the side of a gently sloping mountain well outside of the quicklygrowing suburbs in the heart of the sonoran desert taliesin was organic living melded to its stone sand and gravel surroundings due to the fact that its materials were plucked from those very locations its unique roofing structure could only be dreamed and conceived from the heart of genius as the lack of rainfall allowed it to be redwood and canvas like the teepee s of the native indian cultures having been there before as a child i really could not appreciate it to any great extent then but as an adult i was truly amazed at its massive expanse and by the fact that it was built stone by stone by hand with the loving work of his adoring students their spirits and care are reflected in every pore of the breathing flexing structures joined together in strange illogical ways windy paths odd angles smoothed beams brightly colored carpets and art contrasting paints dripping fountains flapping textures longshallow reflecting pools openaired rooms vaulting stairs lowslung passageways all conceived by the brilliant unconventional mind of the master to ponder and entice thought by confusion of the stated norm being smashed into oblivion purists laugh but those with an unjaundiced eye coupled with a heart of appreciation for the existence of a new form of human living quarters that you have to force yourself to integrate your soul in order to fully exist with it taliesin must become a part of its occupants and visitors like a natural extension of existence in order to impart its magic as creativity abounds with every sense affected at each new revelation lucky students pursuing careers in wood and metal work painting sculpture photography and pottery are allowed to stay on the preserved desert ecosystem in small clever experimental structures or shelters that pop up throughout the acre grounds i got to see many of these during my visit and they were truly interesting to see weird while being functional they all interested me greatly but sadly i was not allowed to get too close or to interact with any of them finally there are large theaters that i saw on the tour for concerts and performances creativity is encouraged to flow from the spirit soul and body  a complete immersion without judgment or criticism freedom for the individual and for the groupthink to attempt to inspire and unconform the conformed it was my dream to see this wonderland again i came i saw i was changed my heart pumped stronger then i cried a little in leaving due to my great fortune however taliesin is in my mind my soul my eyes and her smell is everpresent whenever i think of her so long frank lloyd wright you put your spell on me httpwwwyoutubecom
the best popcorn ever try the jalapeo flavor  it s excellent the owners are very friendly and welcoming i ll definitely recommend this place to everyone
this qt located at th and greenway is my favorite the staff are fast friendly and the restrooms are always clean this qt is not nearly as busy as the others which makes it a more pleasant experience my only gripe is that they charge cents for a fountain drink lrb oz rrb when i can get a oz in a styrofoam cup at circle k for the same price this qt is my qt of choice

i ve said this about chicago vs ny pizza and the same is true about chicago vs east coast hot dogs to argue which is better is the same as arguing if a vacation is better in the mountains or the seashore why do people waste their time lrb and our time rrb trying to compare apples  oranges  if you love your beloved regional favorite why do you waste time energy and money eating what you know you re going to hate then waste our time rating it only a star  one such review on yelp was one that listed their personal choice of what a chicago hot dog is supposed to be like lrb while comparing it to a wny hot dog rrb and screamed in all caps that for a real chicago dog no substitutions are allowed yeech really  you will only eat it the way somebody else tells you it should be eaten  i can see why someone like that would rate ted s star now welcome to ted s in tempe i m proudly from buffalo where ted s was invented and still owns what a real hot dog should taste like i also lived in chicago and ate those things called chicago dogs that are boiled to the point of flavorlessness then covered with so much crap you have no idea what the hot dog tastes like when in chicago i ate as chicagoans do and i did nt bitch and whine that their dogs did nt compare to what i was used to i ate them and i chose to order my own selection of condiments ted s in tempe  well it is the only ted s outside of the buffalo ny area opened by ted himself after his retirement including the tempe location they are a tiny familyowned group of buffaloarea hot dog stands they are absolutely true to what a real wny hot dog tastes like and they do nt wimp out and try to please the midwesterners who wander in by mistake and think they can order a chicago dog not gonna happen i do nt have a favorite at ted s i am a sucker for white hots lrb yeah i know people outside of wny have no idea what that is rrb but my choice usually comes back to the footlong which is lovingly charbroiled lrb i know people outside of wny think you are a space alien if you charbroil a hot dog rrb unlike chicagoans who were re advised like to be told how to eat a hot dog ted s has plenty of choices to make your dog personal i have my choice mustard red relish lrb no folks it s not hot sauce it s a special relish unique to wny and it s also not chili it s relish rrb and a pickle spear on the dog people who kill their dogs with a ton of crap should be reported to peta   rrb ted s onion rings are the gold standard and yes dang you they are greasy like a good onion ring should be and i ca nt resist a large serving of loganberry pop lrb i ll wait while you google what i mean by pop rrb people ted s is hot dog history and those of us who go to the tempe location are lucky beyond words and lrb sorry if i offend anyone rrb but ted s should not ever expand and franchise and open a location in dubuque if you want the one and only you have to come to tempe or go to buffalo otherwise settle for what you can get elsewhere and wish you were at ted s
i stayed here for a business meeting and i loved every minute of it i actually booked an extra two nights so that i could do some sightseeing and relaxing the resort is on an indian reservation outside of chandler if you are flying into phoenix it is about  minutes from the airport for those gambling inclined there is also a wild horse casino lrb and hotel rrb that is down the road the hotel was gorgeous decorated in a southwest motiff the gym was large and had updated equipment and machines there were several pools and a waterslide lrb which i tried of course rrb that overlook the mountains also i went horseback riding early one morning with a guide it is offered through the resort it was decently priced and worth it there are a few trails in the surrounding desert with historical points of interest while i was there one evening at dusk a dust storm blew through  it was actually really cool and only lasted a short time scottsdale is a short driving distance away there are some nice local shops and eateries in that area to explore would highly recommend this resort
oh sabuddy how i love your delicious authentic food and friendly staff the mint tea is perfect without any sweetening hummus is good and always has a lot of tahini and olive oil in the center the lentil soup is why this place is legend now in tempe the schnitzel is my favorite dish a sesame and paprika covered chicken breast pounded thin and fried with love served on top of marinated vegetables rice salad and hummus my last visit was with some coworkers and all four of us ordered the same thing and i got one to go
great space great sound great owner best place in phoenix to see a band
very good service amazing food dinner entree includes jasmine rice for for chicken or tofu i had the siamese thai with fried tofu this is enough for almost people it s over one lb of entree and cup of rice amazing service would highly recommend
 of my girlfriends and i spent our collective th birthdays here at the boulders last weekend plain  simple i did nt want to leave the landscape alone is worth the price the minute you drive into carefree it s like you re in another world transported back in time million years the rocks the wildlife the flowering cacti  it truly is a feast for the eyes we rented two villas four girls in each villa the price was nt bad considering the beauty of each of our houses the only problem that i d point out is that our villa had a very strong mold smell to it which was odd considering we were smack in the middle of the sonoran desert logs lined our ceiling and some had dark black spots on them  so my best guess was that somehow the logs were moldy  could nt figure it out but the smell was pungent enough that it sort of hit you upside the head each time you walked through the door the villa next to ours  where four of our other friends stayed  was perfect no smell at all they also had a beautiful patio with jacuzzi and a great grill i had multiple services at the golden door spa a massage facial and manipedi all were great maybe not the best i ve ever had but certainly good a massage is like pizza you ca nt really have a bad one my girlfriend said her massage was the best she s ever had though so it might have just been the difference in masseuses the people who worked at the spa were fabulous good vibes all around there are numerous hiking trails nearby and most of the group hiked each morning i chose to walk the trails within the resort and take photos of the beauty right in our own backyard on an additional note there are shopping centers close by with an albertson s a wells fargo bank and a drug store so you can grab food lotions  pretty much anything  without having to pay resort prices for them we did eat breakfast and dinner each night at the resort excluding our last night when we cooked for ourselves in the villa the palo verde restaurant was very good but some in our group complained that the service was slow lrb i was so busy talking i did nt even notice rrb room service breakfasts are outrageously priced but that s expected from a resort of this caliber an example egg whites an english muffin roasted potatoes two fruit plates a pastry basket and a granola parfait were that included a gratuity and service charge overall i loved my stay i would definitely return and plan on doing so in the future
thank you jamie for the great customer service i had come into the store on a saturday to buy dance tights the next day i found out that the tights i had purchased for the shoot were the wrong kind i called the store around noon shortly after they opened to see if they had the style and size that i needed the woman on the other end checked and confirmed that they did i was nt sure if i would have time to make it by the store that day so i just thanked her for checking i did nt ask her to hold them or anything an hour later i decided that i needed the tights for the shoot when i went into the store jamie saw me looking at tights and said did you call about the nude fishnets  i set them up here for you just in case nice she opened the package and let me stretch them to check them out and make sure they were the right kind i ended up choosing a different pair based off her suggestion and i love them she exchanged the tights i had purchased the previous day with no trouble i noticed that there are some lousy reviews of this location i would say that my visit on saturday was average but when i returned the next day jamie provided really great service and based off of that i would return thank you for your help jamie

chipotle always hits the spot my fav double steak burrito red salsa and cheese extra cheese with a side of dos i also enjoy the weird music they play
i consider this the best buffet in town compared to old country  hometown there is a large selection of all types of food there is no skimping when it comes to food selection they have a large dessert bar also with sugar free desserts the desserts are awesome not just the standard boring kinds like hometown all the food has been really good the lunch price is about this does not include your drink drinks are another dinner is about not including your drink service has always been good the food is always great
this place is just lovely  a true hidden gem i discovered fuego bistro after it was featured on groupon and i m sure glad i did i have been there times now and each visit was just a great as the previous i have been there on a date i took my year old mom there and i also went with my mids female friends to celebrate a birthday all different audiences but everyone i have taken has loved it needless to say it appeals to many and is perfect for birthdays anniversaries and friendly gettogethers environment i have never sat inside because i very much enjoy the outside patio at night it is very quaint and romantic with a water fountain christmas lights of sorts nice trees and vines and there has been pleasant live music during all of my visits it is a quiet venue making it very easy to converse with those at your table service the fuego bistro staff is attentive friendly and genuine it seems they have all worked there for some time and that the owner does a wonderful job of making them all feel as though they are a family they seem to know and care about each other they believe in the place they work and the customers benefit as a result food delicious my absolute favorite dinner dish is the braised angus short rib roast and i m not even a beef person it is wonderfully marinated and very flavorful i have had all of sides from the mashed potatoes to the carrots and all of them are great what i love about fuego is that they take a classic dish and add its own flare with an array of spices and sauces prices the dinner dishes range in the mid to low s but i have only visited fuego with a groupon or livingsocial voucher in hand i love that fuego is so supportive of deals and the waiterswaitresses are not only accepting of the vouchers but they are enthusiastic about your savings as well i highly recommend you visit fuego bistro for a unique and pleasant dining experience
the kalbi and champon was excellent will be heading back there again soon
i think i am in love with sprouts no seriously it s a little crunchy lrb lots of mountain biking spandexwearing treehugginglike people rrb but these guys do have one of the best selections of fresh organic fruits and vegs around lrb maybe with the exception of whole foods rrb at a reasonable price that s not what i like most about this place though i love their free guide to gluten  and wheatfree eating that s placed throughout the store the booklet contains a nononsense list of foods and brands that do not contain gluten that are sold within the store the staff members are very knowledgable and can explain which supplements are best for people who are sensitive to gluten it s not until you try to eliminate this substance from your diet that you truly gain an understanding of how much crap actually contains it it s everywhere anyway this store chain is so much cheaper than the majority of mainstream grocers eg fry s albertsons their bulk product sections are really phenomenal and offer customers a great deal of variety to choose from at an even better price love it love it love it
great food good service good prices
no matter if you want to learn thai boxing at a competitive level or just want to get in shape the folks at sitan can get you there if you are willing it s not a gym for the social gym rats although the atmosphere is very open and friendly before and after classes the workouts are designed to guide you into the best shape of your life but they are not for the person looking to loaf their way into shape the gym is also clean and well maintained if you want the workout of your life give it a try you wo nt be disappointed
during the tailend of our trip to az this past weekend my vegetarian husband and i found green and loved it so much we ate there times in days it would have been had it not been closed one morning as a meateater with a soy allergy there are many reasons not to eat here but i gave all of that up to enjoy as many entrees as possible where do i begin we tried the buffalo wings which had the right taste and texture as meat ones and the ranch dressing was perfect the crab puffs which were mindblowing the bbq sandwich the curry pasta the argentine sandwich lrb delicious bread and chimichurri sauce rrb the fish tacos lrb which were good but not nearly as amazing as the other entrees rrb and the kung pao chicken and oh yes two cupcakes and the betterfinger soy ice cream i am so depressed there is nt one in austin but i would say green is reason enough to go back to az
best authentic mexican food ever very inexpensive the sisters that work there are really friendly and make you feel like you are coming into there home every time i go there i leave with a smile on my face it really does nt get any better then this place can not save enough good things about this place it is a must stop to visit
changing hands is the only bookseller i will ever go to in this city the staff is fantastic the atmosphere is amazing and you will always get a great price the events that they hold are unparalleled  i have met some of my favorite authors there true story a few years ago i was looking for a hard to find book and had checked out bn borders bookmans and i could nt find it anywhere i walked into changing hands and asked for it they special ordered it for me and did nt charge me until i picked it up great great helpful bookseller
yum after doing some shopping at the mekong plaza we decided on having lunch here very clean which is a big plus for a vietnamese establishment the food was great very tasty would love to back
toasted coconut with salted carmel do it that s all i am going to say oh and the macaroons
ok so this is how much i love this product i first tasted lee s at a yelp elite event and waited and dreamed a whole year to eat it again when i was invited to the next year s elite pleydate it was the topic of the first question out of my mouth is lee s gonna be there  lrb ok maybe the whole french restaurant s bone marrow gravy came to mind too but i digress rrb when i made it inside to pleydate i literally ran to that booth having desert before dinner i am all about the alcohol infused ice cream now the funny thing about that is i am not even a big ice cream lover i will have to visit the shop soon
this place is great i have two bunnies and i had called all over for prices on spay  neutering every place was quoting at least for just the neuter and as much as for the spay i was worried i would nt be able to afford it when i came across az spay  neuter clinic it only cost me for the neuter and for the spay i was nervous about the quality of surgery with a price so cheap but it has been two weeks since i took my bunnies in and they have not had any problems at all they have nt shown signs of pain there was no swelling everything went perfectly and for half the price of other places
had the opportunity to take about people here for dinner service was outstanding we had one waitress with a helper but then when food and apps came there must have been people getting it to us food was great everyone complimented and the service which in a large group is even more important was excellent could not have ask for more  great job server 
love this place hard to find really good mexican food and was so glad to happen upon this place will go back for more no complaints at all
i love this place excellent value for money great service wide range of selections lot s of them vegetarian plus they have a  fit fare menu that s pretty delicious too i would particularly recommend the veggie skillet what i like the most about this place though is the fact that it s always open literally always  even on thanksgiving christmas new year s day
yo you like chinese food right  and of course you love mexican food you re in arizona then you will love this place the wonderful place combines two fantastic food genres and makes them fantasticer by combining them you can get jade chicken in a burrito or in a quesadilla even if you do nt want to combine mexican food with chinese food eating them in a more traditional lrb  rrb way is still an amazing treat you can take the food to go and sit down inside the restaurant setting is a little bare bones but they bring your food to your table so it comes out even  you also get a free cookie so that s awesome possibly the best thing about this place is the mascot it s probably the most racist mascot ever panda wearing a sombrero with six shooter ridiculous and i love it
we came here today after a long day at the park there was a long line but the staff was very fast i ordered the chicken burrito with black beans rice sour cream and i had them add grilled veggies and extra hot sauce the burrito was hot huge and delicious the only negative was that the last several bites were all rice great healthy meal to soak up the beer though
true louisiana cooking staff is helpful and if you have a question about a food they carry they give you a sample dessert is a must and people can easily share plate
i ve stopped by three times the first time i had french press flavored cover brew was well timed and very tasty i had a muffin that was fresh and moist the second time i ordered a latte and croissant the latte was done well the croissant while it had a good bread taste was not the layer buttery taste i was looking for lrb recommended essence bakery in tempe as an alternate source rrb third visit was perfect cappuccino and biscotti coffee roaster is locally sourced from passport in scottsdale biscotti is from bad boy biscotti in gilbert service was very friendly the same person made my coffee drinks each time and the quality was consistent the atmosphere is delightful with the open doors or outside tables and background music that does nt over power conversation i m giving five stars i ve been very pleased on each visit and i m glad they ve joined the arcadia neighborhood
los sombreros is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley the food is always just perfect the prices are extremely reasonable i modeled my own guacamole recipe after theirs it s that good try the specials of the day they re always great the service has been a little hit  miss for me most of the time they re fine there s this one woman who is extremely unfriendly i think she just does nt like me  rrb but ya know with food  ambiance like this it does nt bother me if i occasionally end up with a cranky server
cost plus world market i d hold hands with you if i could i d take you on a picnic though we d eat your food and drink your wine of course i d whisper sweet nothings in your ear and never let you go then i d move you into my home and let you decorate true there is cost plus but it s usually worth it and as a previous yelper mentioned the clearance racks in the center of the store are pretty awesome and you can definitely find great buys world market is my goto spot for home decor i ve managed to find quite a few charming and uniquelooking articles for my dingy little apartment for a very reasonable price on the clearance rack however while browsing i always get sucked into the fullprice displays also because they re always so bright and beautiful and wellpresented i actually spent on two towels yesterday granted they are plush justcameintoday purple and espresso bath towels but still there was a time that i spent five bucks at big lots on towels and now i m getting roped into for the ohsopretty ones i am also a big fan of the gourmet food and wine selection if you have to drop on a jar of pasta sauce which is pricey i know please please do sample the gia russa sauces from italy the alla vodka sauce is something special and considering that i personally can not buy a jar of newman s own or classico without doctoring it up a bit it seems worth buying a jar of this good stuff heating it up and serving asis it s a nice treat that ll serve me twice spend time on the wine selection as you can find great bottles for much better prices than at many liquor stores that s one area where you can get a great value at world market also i m a sucker for cute dishware and kitchen goods and that kind of stuff abounds here and really price is all relative it s such a better bargain than shopping at crate  barrel or williams sonoma or shops like that i m a fan though i do nt think i ve ever been in without dropping fifty bucks at minimum
took our  month old son for his first haircut we had a wonderful experience with miss becky his hair is super super cute not your typical standard cut but a more versatile cool boy cut he watched baby einstein while sitting in the driver seat and did nt even notice he was getting his haircut his head jerking periodically did nt even phase miss becky she cut his hair with the love and care as if she were his own grandma my parents were there videotaping the whole event ca nt wait to be regulars at this family friendly salon oh yeah  and the price was actually what u should pay for a kids cut

oh how i love preflight traveling these days can really suck  it s a hassle getting to and through the airport so i have to thank preflight for taking some of the pain away i ve had nothing but great experiences with them the booth attendants are always friendly and happy i do nt know how they do it but without fail no sooner have i gotten out of my car and the magic bus is magically there i do nt think i ve waited for more than minutes ever they keep the shuttles icy cold in the summer too my absolute favorite thing about preflight is the drivers these guys are not messing around taking the scenic route to the airport and driving as slow as possible they re efficient and they re courteous best of all when you return to sky harbor you wo nt wait long for a shuttle to show up i do nt know how often they run them but i ve come in at all hours of the day and night without having to wait forever also if you want a car wash they do an incredible job  the best car wash i ve had in phx they even vacuumed out my trunk without me asking or charging me more considering that i d been hauling plants all around in it the weekend before do check the website for coupons and consider joining their frequent parker program for some nice perks

another great spot in my neighboorhood i had never eaten and a planet sub so i perused the menu and the gentleman behind the counter offered some advise i settled on the chicken parmesan sub and a cup of chicken enchilada soup my daughter got the kids meal with a grilled cheese chips and a drink the total was just under great value my sandwich was delicous and the soup was tasty and had just a little kick to it my daughter loved her grilled cheese with all the yummy melted cheese and fresh baked bread while were were finishing up one of the gentleman that was working in the back came out to ask us how our dinner was he was in from kansas helping the store with some minor issues it appears those issues have been fixed because i told him everything was great and we would definetly be back since we live close by who does nt like fresh baked bread and fresh ingredients  they also have a punch card so that s another great incentive yum

prickly pear margaritas were ordered by my best friend and her momi had to join the party and ooh what a party it was yumm i have to say that i have never had food like this i absolutely loved the authentic spanishmexican wonderland of flavors which danced lrb not literally rrb on my plates following the prickly pear party i enjoyed the most amazing spinach salad spinach and frisee salad sweet and spiced pecans goat cheese croquette with warm chorizo dressing  i want it now who would have thought that goat cheese in a croquette could be so decadent  the other members of my party enjoyed the tomato salad and the chilled avocado soup we were all pleased as we moved onto the main course my best friends dad went with the suckling pork and i loved my oven roasted chicken atmosphere we went on a sunday night so it was very very quite and intimate i can imagine it being much more alive on a weekend evening price i think it was up there but thanks to visiting parents i was able to dodge this one food outstanding i can not believe i am just the th person to review this lets go yelpers i know you will love this
i m giving bobby q an extra star in this update to my previous review because although it has its share of hits and misses it is in fact as good as it gets in phoenix for great barbecue i love barbecue it is a hobby of mine when i get stuck on something and want to know what it should look and taste like i go to bobby q and am almost never disappointed most recently this happened with beef brisket i m going to upload a picture i took of bobby q s brisket because seriously if you look at it and do nt want to immediately die from desire then you just do nt like barbecue if i had anything bad at all to say about bobby q it would be that sometimes their meats can be slightly overdone but this is not the norm their quality control considering how much food they must serve to keep up with the demand is astounding their prices are too high but of course you re paying for the almost disneyesque atmosphere their sauce is absolutely delicious lrb although it should be noted they do nt understand what spicy means rrb all in all i really ca nt say enough good things about this place go look at my brisket photo seriously

so we re driving home from work today  ready to face the nasty rush hour traffic when my husband tells me that there s a new place we have to try  pizza a metro he s a fan of the new times and particularly loves to read savage love hmmm  he read a review on this relatively new restaurant which had very favorable comments anyway we love to eat and are willing to go anywhere for good food lucky for us we work downtown and pizza a metro was within minutes the question was should we go home and eat cocoa pebbles for dinner or experience what we would later that evening call the best italian restaurant in this city  the question  ridiculous  the choice was obvious first we entered the tiny strip mall just east of i on thomas where this teeny little restaurant sits seriously though if you blink you might miss it so keep your eyes peeled the restaurant inside was really cute and super clean the few tables in the place were granite nice touch greeting us immediately was the owner who was so welcoming and highly attentive we began our meal with complementary flat bread that was fresh from the brick oven with a side of eggplant componata as a spread both were so incredibly delicious and truly set the tone for the rest of the meal that was to come we had the calamari fritti appetizer which was accompanied with the most amazing marinara dipping sauce my husband ordered a small pizza that s big enough for two people to share a piping hot beautiful wood fired pizza crust layered with red sauce delicious melty mozzarella amazing sliced sausage and rapini needless to say the pizza was out of this world ok so just when i thought it could nt get any better i tasted my eggplant parmesan that came with a side of pasta with marinara honestly this was sooo good that i thought i was going to cry i ca nt even put into words how delicious this dish was i really had to savor every bite and relish in the smooth eggplant that was covered with a blanket of mozzarella and divine marinara it was just sinfully good this was truly a decadent feast with very reasonable prices i even got to practice my italian with the owner if you have nt been you must go and support this tiny restaurant other than it s weird location i could nt find anything wrong with pizza a metro as everything was oh so right buon apetito
i ve only heard of this place but i did nt know much about it until one of the moms from our group set up a presentation at a park the foundation s name pretty much explains what they are all about the two women volunteers who came out had been doing this for over years are also avid birders themselves my little cutie pie and i are humbly less than amateurs we had the little kiddos sit around to meet the very first bird they brought out which was a schreech owl he was missing an eye due to a birth defect he was so cute the next one they brought out was a great horned owl there was oooh s and aaaah s at the site of the huge bubo then a huge raptor a red tailed hawk came out of the biggest cage what a sight i wonder if hand feeding these kinds of birds are what makes them so tame what are turkey vultures good for  one of the ladies asked as the red headed scavenger sat there looking at the kiddos he was obviously already fed thank goodness thanksgiving i answered by the darting look i got it was nt the right answer thanks to the two volunteers who took the time to educate us on these precious creatures very neat way to learn about these birds and have fun at the same time if you want a tour of their facilities make sure you make an appointment i ca nt wait to check it out in person
go on monday get the dollerrrr make you hollerrrr special i got the vigazz burger with sweet potato fries my burger was delicious juicy and flavorful the sweet potato fries were good not awesome they could have been a tad more crisp i also got a cocktail that had strawberry and basil muddled with citrus vodka and lemonade very refreshing i ve had this combo before and the vig s version was superior to what i ve had before although it was it better be good right 
this place is on my short list of things and places i miss most about scottsdale since moving to pa we used to eat here all the time in fact my wife and i had dinner here the night before having our first child pasquale lrb the owner rrb told her that olive oil would help induce labor and he was nt lying the menu does nt change from lunch to dinner and its also a byob but that s ok because pasquale and his staff make you feel right at home indoors or on the small patio out front the food is nt fancy but it does nt have to be good italian about food family and fun insider s tip still hungry ask for a little more lrb its often on the house rrb
headed back to lobby s how i missed this tasty burger i was nt disappointed with round the burger was still fantastic i m also happy that the fries were a little bit less salty than my previous trip with any burger purchase getting the combo pack lrb friessoda rrb is the smart choice i do wish that they would lose the styrofoam soda cups and offer more than one size of drinks make sure to grab plenty of napkins before you sit down the burger can make a mess with the homemade sauce dripping off the meat and bun that s a good thing in my opinion
breakfast at noon  awesome even more awesome  front flipping row parking ha had the daybreaker  egg white omelet with roasted turkey breast topped w  tomatoavocado salsa absolutely fantastically wonderfully delicious it was light  flavorful  quite a bit of turkey good turkey not the pressed processed stuff claiming to be turkey  rrb love their ice tea mmm mmmm mm
you ca nt really go wrong with fox i am not much of a meat eater but when i want meat i want a good bloody piece of steak and arrogant butcher did not disappoint its not the best steak i ve had but the service sides drinks and atmosphere def make for an overall great dining experience
one of the best coffee shops in scottsdale fun events great chia lrb the best in town rrb great staff and the best to hang out with a laptop
rivas helped me get through numerous late night study sessions and early morning hangovers hard to go wrong with anything on the menu but my two faves are the carne asada and chile rellano burritos with fresh horchata of course
this is probably the nicest library i have been to other than the huge central library in downtown los angeles definitely smaller of course but the ambiance of it is pretty cool it has a beautiful design inside and out very peaceful surroundings outside and when the weather gets cooler it will be awesome to sit outside i live miles down from it and just barely discovered it this will be my new study spot  rrb
hugo vino at cycle was an amazing experience where to begin but with the starters the roasted beet salad was excellent as was the bruscetta the short rib was so good i ca nt stop wishing for more the shrimp was really good too and dessert yum goat cheese cheesecake  omg and strawberries with marscapone cheese light and delicious we are praying hugo vino returns really soon
this is exactly the kind of place that every city needs it s artsyandreasonablebar meets independent movie theater and the result is a beautiful marriage of shows snacks and sips i had a livingsocial deal here for two movie tickets and a bottle of wine when my companions and i walked in we were pleasantly surprised at the comfy booths inexpensive drinks and abundance of snacks available for premovie munching in fact we almost missed the start of the show because we were enjoying lounging so much we walked into the theater and had our choice of comfy rocking seats with tableandchair options in the back for those with more snacks i appreciated that the chairs included a spot to hold wine glasses without tipping them over plus the movie that we saw lrb sleepwalk with me rrb was excellent overall i m a huge fan of this place and plan to get a membership for the next year and visit again again
the  ultimate foodie  stop on my sw eating adventure this summer no other chef amazed me half as much as payton curry my husband and i lucked out on our last night in scottsdale with a reservation at digestif not just any reservation but we lucked upon a special sunday night cocktail and food pairing that was beyond our wildest dreams called the with a twist cocktail party most of the guests were friends of the chef or favorite regulars but we lucked upon two cancellations we were seated around the bar which takes up most of the tiny restaurant this is not a usual bar with a bartender and bottles of alcohol behind it no no this is a chefcentric bar with the kitchen in full view incredible we were served our first pairing  grilled bread smothered in mobay cheese with a bltini the vodka had been baconinfused wow second was lardowrapped peaches served with an awesome cachacabased drink third was buttery housemade prosciutto with an incogroni  aperol gin and pineau des charentes very special a little bitter and a fabulous aperitif that was followed by a fabulous halibut ceviche the main course of lamb chops paired with a lavender sidecar which was to die for and finally a dessert of flan with a lovely dessert cocktail i m not sure if you can get these drinks and items on the regular menu but the chef is such a downtoearth cool and motivated young guy that i think he would make about anything you could ask for and that s as likely to be the case with drinks as well i ca nt sing out my praises loud enough for this incredible spot where the food and the chef are centerstage  right where they belong fantastic stars
we had a problem with a kitchen outlet that the technician from dodge was able to quickly diagnose and fix i found dodge here on yelp and called around noon my phone call was returned promptly and a technician arrived later in the afternoon he found a bad connection in one of our outlets and replaced our gfci outlet i felt the price was very reasonable electric work is something i wish i could do myself but i know my limitations that s just stuff that needs to be done right i was impressed with the work i would definitely use dodge again if we have an electrical problem
i am beyond the pale to put it mildly and i was thrilled with the super service streakfree tan and perfectly believable color that chris gave me got so many people asking me if i had gone on vacation i decided to actual take one i have gone back every other week since the color lasts me about days longer than any other spray tani had before i also really like a more recent formula she used on me that you wash off after only hours nice i did buy the hemp lotion which smelled great and i think may be helping me hold the color so long highly recommend and have told every bride i know about this place clean reasonably priced and they have really cute dresses there too
super cute neighborhood awesome atmosphere and decor with good looking people all in a great mood having fun excellent service beautiful presentation and a menu you just ca nt decide on because there are so many great choices fun with a group especially at the community table fun upbeat bar decor is cozy and dim but festive at the same time and on top of all this the good is excellent highlights we re street corn with a special sauce that is reminiscent of thousand island but sweeter and zestier yucca fries w tangy bbq sauce caesar salad with a texmex twist saucy short ribs and pumpkin bread pudding to die for

it felt like as if i have been living under a rock for some time i ve lived in scottsdale since and never knew there was such a thing it was my first time there today vendors are varied in offerings there is quite a bit of pre made products as opposed to produce mclendon s offerings are quite extensive though and should cover what you might be looking for there are smaller produce stalls with fresh in season items too carnivore  there are vendors that sell meat products too from farm fresh chicken pork and grass fed beef you can also get salmon frozen i m sure farm fresh eggs and even fresh goat s milk important tips  bring cash small bills preferrably  come early for the best offerings  bring your reusable bags  if you plan to bring your legged pet  walk your dog first to ensure it is well behaved and will be able to calmly mingle with other furry creatures do nt be that lady who yanks the leash and says no no you are a show dog you do not do that  no joke witnessed this there more importantly come prepared with doodoo bags in case of any oopsies already have some top picks that i will for sure go back to next saturday  mclendon farms produce items were top notch yes pricey if you compare to local grocery store items but if you are a whole foods shopper not at all the produce is definitely fresh and organic i and my family for one are always on the hunt for organic and locally grown items as much as possible  frogs organic bakery lrb see separate review rrb  claudine s kitchen  first of all the gentleman there was very friendly and helpful eye opening and shows just how little i know tabbouleh not greek it is lebanese there is no such thing as eggplant hummus  the correct term is baba ghannouge the labneh lrb creamy dip of cream cheese and yogurt rrb and zaatar lrb heavily herbed pita rrb is sooo good also picked up some prickly pear cactus jelly from cotton country jams and some treats for my pup from bark n good definitely going back next saturday and giving trips to whole foods a rest for awhile

the food was excellent the martinis were to die for and the service was excellent plus happy hour prices made it a perfect choice
this is a great place for that home cooking feel they have a lot of wonderful dishes from region around hong kong and they prepare the standards so everyone is happy do nt hesitate to ask for suggestions and advice it s sort of classic to order a soup and then a chicken fish beef and pork dish and many a tofuvegi dish i do nt know any other way of ordering besides family style where you order the number of entree per the number of people in the group dining plus a soup we had a house special noodle pan fried xo fish spicy pork and tofu hot pot beef and chinese broccoli plus hot and sour soup each was great this is now our go to chinese food restaurant in phoenix
the best part of mbar is their new bartender we went there to see michael he used to be our bartender at tommy vs he is so awesome super personable and will make sure you enjoy your drink i had a wonderful zinfandel he recommended and the hubby had his typical margarita on the rocks with salt the place is very nice a little pricey but it is what you can expect from a nice resort after all
soft opening so still working out the kinks food was deelish scallop poppers  crispy and spicy  not at all greasy honey chickena little sticky but so good teriyaki chickensubtler than other places teriyaki but much better flavor and chicken was tender tootzi roll  bursting with flavor and rolled perfectly nice touches with cucumber water upscale asian decor unique glasses menus plates etc will definitely be back
this review is long overdue and i have a feeling it s going to be one that makes my mouth water as i type it my grandma introduced me to roma garden long ago with their delicious herb butter and warm crusty bread with a glass of house chianti i overlooked their oddly shaped rolling chairs and focused on the excellent waitstaff and delicious chef mastacciolo or chef raviolis or the pollo parmasiana or the fettucini alfredo or the oh crap i told you this would happen i m so hungry so it s not the most uptodate restaurant in town but it s so cozy and the food is fantastic they have happy hours with off beer and well off their vast selection of house wines and off appetizers in the bar from pm daily reverse happy hour from pmclose and all day on monday  wednesday but what i suggest if you re looking to save some cash and are dying to try this place is to go eat monday to thursday from  pm smaller dinners for half price their normal portions are ginormous anyway so it s really the perfect size your stomach and wallet will thank you
excellent food good service and great prices the pho is excellent but frankly everything on the menu is very good i ve started using it as my lunch meeting place and everyone i ve taken there has been hooked
by far the best mexican food in scottsdale food and salsa amazing service phenomenal great prices
i do nt know anything about the chef nor his reputation a group of us we going to have a business lunch and we wanted to go here since its around the corner but alas no lunch the menu was intriguing though so i went back a couple nights later alas it was worth it inside was well decorated it had kind of a lodge look but there was a small bit of whimsy with the photos and such the service was spot on and did not come around after the food was delivered to badger us about how everything was speaking of food  the green chili macaroni n cheese is the best mac and cheese i think ever there was just the right amount of chili flavor to not overwhelm this alone would make me want to come back the smoked chicken flatbread was good the burger was perfectly cooked and huge although completely unseasoned this is nt a gripe just unexpected the wines list is good as well if you want a cheap one and do nt mind white get the argentinian wine under unusual it was worth paying restaurant price for
i enjoy ordering my cakes from this particular safeway and this past weekend was no different i was a little worried as i was ordering a very specific birthday cake that i need on saturday october for a friends birthday party she basically wanted a strawberry shortcake cake lrb you know whipped cream frosting fresh strawberries in the middle strawberries and whip cream on top rrb when i went to safeway on october after going to other locations to attempt to order this cake miss frida informed me that they were currently out of strawberries and was nt sure when they would get their shipment in all i was thinking was its monday and i do nt need this cake to saturday and there is a chance that safeway would nt get a shipment of strawberries  but its monday and i do nt need it til saturday is what my mind was screaming alas i took it all in stride as miss frida told me not to worry and that she would call me on friday if for some reason they did nt get any strawberries in time and that we would work something out so after having a mini panic attack as i had already been to other places in the last hours and was tired of cake shopping but i was determined to get the type of cake my friend wanted so friday rolls around and although i had not heard from frida i decided to stop in anyway to see what the progress was she let me know that that had received a fresh shipment of strawberries on thursday and that everything was a go needless to say my mind was instantly at ease so fast forward to saturday i pick up the cake which looked fabulous and headed on to the party to finish setting up and getting everything ready for all the guest when it came time to cut the birthday girl was beyond happy and let me tell you that cake was off the hook talk about fresh my goodness everyone loved the cake and could nt believe that it came from safeway the birthday girl was happy as she got exactly what she wanted and the guest loved it hats off to frida for making one hell of a cake and to safeway for not letting down
this may be the best food i have eaten in phoenix my mom and i came here after a day at the spa lrb is this my life  rrb if i could better recall my experience at the now defunct seasaw i would possibly say they fall on the same continuum but for very different reasons you do nt come to these restaurants for large american meals focused on confusing people of what value should mean this place makes you think about each bite you take wondering what the hell it is and why does it taste so amazing  i think i m a pretty good cook so i m most impressed by dishes i do nt think i can replicate it s not even an option here  stinging nettle anyone  the menu really does change daily you can check it online this is a place that is centered on vegetables but recognizes most of the population likes meat here no problems regardless of dietary preferences vegan etc just let them know lrb when making reservations rrb ordering is fun lrb and expensive  thanks mom rrb because you order via courses either a la carte or their daily tasting menu with or without wine pairing lrb compared to other cities this is a great deal rrb antipasto options for everyone this is an incredibly innovative menu especially for phoenix and such a beautiful setting everything is local and most everything is organic homemade gnocchi with cheese from lrb peoria  rrb wonderful wine list tons of awards for it ask for a recommendation and you ll be duly satisfied they also run a number of seasonal dinners usually focused on meat always focused on local this is the perfect special occasion experience if you love the safe cookie cutter restaurant scene that often seems to dominate phoenix this is nt for you i m giving it stars because when taking location and an unusual menu into consideration there just is nt anything else like it in phoenix
man i have always loved their food my fav is the all you can eat beef ribs those are the best
yes i d met sweet republic s helen and jan before i ever set foot in the shop and helen and jan are splendid people bias be damned  the product at sr is brilliant unique to the valley and somehow both familiar and avantgarde i paid my first visit lrb pilgrimage  rrb tonight with kelly b and her superspy husband among us we sampled everything in the case  flavors remarkable lrb cheese course duo ice cream  roquefort and dates rrb bracing lrb basil lime sorbet rrb and flatout unfair lrb mayan chocolate ice cream rrb i wound up having a sundae for probably the first time in years mayan chocolate and bananas foster ice cream fresh blueberries salted caramel and homemade whipped cream on top kelly s husband had watermelon sorbet then he went back for cantaloupe sorbet i have no idea what kelly ordered as i was so absorbed by what i was eating that i entered a fugue state everything is made inhouse and helen has some serious culinary chops for those who want comfort flavors sr whips up mint chip rocky road belgian chocolate and other goodies that wo nt invite cognitive dissonance what really impressed me was the attention to design in the shop the place is really sharp and they went with quite a few ecofriendly choices from aka green and other vendors check out the tables topped with kirei board the recycled glass tiles behind the counter and the bamboo wall decorations it s all smashing  viva sweet republic
bookmans i love this place when they thought of this idea it was a great day what could be better than every type of book you could ever want tons of magazines puzzles games cd s videos and even books on cd my new fav is the housewares dept you can find so many wonderful treasures there including clothing items on occasion you never know what you will find when you come in it is always exciting you can take your gently used books and other products that they sell then you get trade for your own purchases it is so much fun this is a very clean store with very clean bathrooms the staff is always very helpful they can show you where a book might be if they have it but they do not a system to track if they have the book in stock all in all a great experience
if you re looking for some kind of special map for your next adventure or even a basic road map for wherever this place either will have it or can probably get it i came in looking for the new version of the apachesitgreaves national forest map a couple weeks ago after no luck at rei not only did they have it but they had about copies of it sure i could have bought it online but if i can get it now and support a local business at the same time then score staff was friendly and helpful and you can tell they like what they are doing store is right off i it s slightly difficult to pull in and out of their parking lot because of how close you are to the street so be careful
as a bonafide recovering art bitch i give this university gallery the blue ribbon award for kickassery truly a hidden gem lrb i hate that phrase rrb in tucson the collection and the revolving pieces never cease to impress me i have brought almost every single tourist from the east coast to this gallery including some photography professors and they leave with snoooty mouths agape that in this pleasant little desert town resides a highcaliber well manicured collection of the arts i am always upset when i visit and i ca nt stop by this galleryand do nt miss out out on their catalogs magazines books postcards and prints they have in the atrium as unique giftsdecoration splleeeendid

i broke my cardinal rule of dining which is never eat sushisashimijapanese food outside of california or manhattan in the us because the reviews of this place were so solid that i had to try it shinbay blew my mind lrb in a super fantastical way rrb we did the course tasting menu lrb we could nt call ahead to reserve a bigger tasting menu because we only found this place online hours before dinner on our last night in scottsdale rrb we also got a bottle of sake from the less expensive menu every course was ridiculously amazing the uni alone changed my world it is the best sushi i have ever eaten in my life and it may have ruined me for lesser places i will seriously fly back to scottsdale just to eat here again and i m not that big a high roller it s just worth it
so after our less than desireable experience at kabuki my dh and i came here for lunch low and behold the hostess was smiling the waiter came within minutes of us being seated and the fooddrink was equally as quick in the amount of time it took us to wait to eat at kabuki we were in enjoyed a nice meal and out in minutes i enjoyed the chicken sandwhich delicious their french fries are really great or perhaps i was just so friggin hungry by this point i would have settled on eating my own fingers my dh had the pulled pork sandwhich and said it was equally as good as my entree the waiter was so great and had the nicest smile totally attentive and super friendly at last someone who actually enjoys their job i ca nt say one bad thing about this place but also there is nt anything spectacular about it either the other reviewers are right on when they say something is missing perhaps live fish   rrb
i returned yesterday for lunch and the food and customer service was just as great as the first time wildflower is officially my new favorite place for healthy and fresh prepared meals
i love this place all the guy workers are awesome julie angie heather and zayne are the best girls ever  rrb i get treated very well here and i love the atmosphere i ve never been treated so well at any other restaurant in my life i used to go here almost everyday for breakfast and lunch because they have such great deals i ve been here a few times for karaoke and to watch local bands i have not been disappointed at this bar grandma still cooks at this place and her food is fabulous she is the sweetest lady and she is more than happy to talk to her customers  you can even call her grandma even their doorman is super friendly this place is like a home away from home thank you hollywood alley rrb
this is one excellent ethiopian restaurant rivals anything i ve sampled in washington dc or seattle if i lived in phoenix this would be a top restaurant for me lrb along with lolo s chicken  waffles  yum rrb lalibela takes a slightly different approach to their menu many of the entrees are offered as small portions lrb  each rrb they suggest each diner order  of these to make a meal kitfo and lamb tibs dishes are offered as full entrees and like many ethiopian restaurants you can order combo plates lrb meat combo veggie combo house combo plate etc rrb this made deciding on our meal a little more complicated but also offered more flexibility for sampling different dishes our favorite dish ordered was the lamb tibs lrb the spicy version with awaze spice paste rrb lamb was soooo tender and the spices were a delight  rich in flavor but not too hot for those with tame palettes good thing it comes as a full order  four of us were competing for bites we ordered a half portion of keye wott lrb beef in a spicy brown sauce rrb that was some of the best i ve ever had again rich in flavor but not too spicy my favorite ethiopian meat dish is kitfo  choice beef sort of like steak tartar lrb servered raw or lightly cooked rrb but with ethiopian spices lalibela s was pretty good just not transcendent like the lamb tibs or beef keye wott the vegetable dishes were on a whole excellent  especially the yellow lentils gomen lrb collard greens rrb and spicy lrb wott rrb lentils staff was great  attentive helpful service unlike some ethiopian restaurants this one is very userfriendly although in some cases the menu accommodates american tastes it does nt compromise on quality or authenticity one note on the injera lrb spongelike bread used to scoop up the entrees rrb  it s a mix of wheat flour and teff lrb a grain indigenous to ethiopia rrb and i do nt think it s fermented like injera that is made with  teff i m used to the latter but you can argue lalibela s injera does nt compete with the flavor of the entrees as much all in all one of the best ethiopian restaurants i ve been to and i have been to many in the states only problem now is whether my favorite ethiopian restaurants in seattle will still taste as good highly highly recommended
great family restaurant in a soso shopping center i live in las vegas but travel to phoenix every other week i eat here every chance i get and always order the same thing  smothered green chili burrito with rice it s made with pork  more new mexican than sonoran and it s absolutely fantastic plus their salsa has a nice fiery flavor that is highly addictive love this place i just wish they d open a place in vegas

i went to scottsdale last weekend to stay with friends and go to the interpol concert after an amazing concert saturday night we went to breakfast sunday morning at arcadia farms my friends who live in scottsdale had raved about this restaurant so i said  yes let s go sunday morning i m so very happy that we did first of all the place itself is so charming and adorable i love the black  white sofas white chairs and black  white framed photos on the walls we sat just inside the first room right behind the scrumptious baked goods it was difficult to decide what to order everything sounded wonderful but i chose the wild mushroom  chive omelet with goat cheese fresh fruit potatoes and a side of applewood smoked bacon and fresh squeezed orange juice my friend chantage chose the same thing but opted for a side of toasted ciabatta bread  we shared the bread and bacon and my friend lisa chose the breakfast pannini with rosemary infused ham white cheddar and scrambled eggs on a fresh baked baguette also served with fresh fruit the fresh squeezed orange juice was a delicious way to begin our meal our omelets were so yummy  the goat cheese was the perfect choice to top the mushrooms and chives the potatoes were slightly dry but still had a lovely flavor the fresh fruit was refreshing and lisa loved her pannini of course we had to pick up some of their fresh baked pastries on the way out chantage bought an almond croissant that was to die for yes i had a bite and it was wonderful lisa chose one as well but also took other pastries home for her husband aww all in all this cafe is high on my evergrowing list of favorite restaurants in scottsdalephoenix i ca nt wait to come back when the market opens across the street so i can bring some of this deliciousness back to tucson
living in different cities in the us we took it for granted that each city had it s own landmark theatre lrb indie chain owned by mark cuban rrb so when we moved to the valley we were surprised with the limited choices for seeing indie movies harkins camelview is really the only available option we come here at least twice a month and the place is always clean and well kept the employees are always friendly and happy and yes if you signup for the harkin s cup deal the soda refills are not bad i know this must seem odd but how do you evaluate a movie theater anyway  you can rate the films i guess  but really it becomes a choice of location area convenience and yes is the place clean and the seats comfortable  well yes to all those questions it s a nice place harkins probably could update the seats and spruce up the place a little as one yelper noted but camelview is a nice theater and i m just happy we have it because without it what are our options exactly  enjoy
went here last night to grab drinks with a friend and had a blast the place was pretty empty in the downstairs bar so the bartender was at our service i did nt catch his name but he has a shaved head and makes the best drinks the gin gimlet was perfect not too strong or too sweet the dirty stoli martini was even better oh how i love a good martini then he took the reigns with our drinks after that my friend had a chocolate martini and then something that tasted like a raspberry creamsicle both were sweet but delicious and i had a blueberry lemondrop and an appletini do nt judge me on the appletini i just wanted a green drink they were all good and we were in reverse happy hour so we got the tenderloin skewers and bacon wrapped scallops for a plate they were huge bites for only a piece and i loved the sauces that came with it i m coming back for sure but only if the bartender is there i love the drinks put anything in a martini glass and i m there

this place was absolutely delicious does nt look like much on the surface but my party had a variety of dishes and nothing was less than stellar the sopes are the best i ve ever had and the corn quesadillas were crispy and perfect
i live an exit away i ca nt believe i m just now coming here after months food was delicious nothing fancy or pretty just tastes great raymundo was our server and he was so nice all the waiters and waitresses seemed friendly and close as they joked with one another and working quickly but very well together customer service is more than half of the reason i keep coming back to places you either got it or you do nt and this place has it

i m from california and ive only been to a place like this like twice and they really only have one diner like this available to go to lrb ruby s rrb not that its bad or anything but i ve gone to it so many times and its become less of a diner and more of a restaurant you say to yourself they are the same thing no they are not its the ambiance that you can tell the difference i frequent to az and i ve driven by this place a lot but i ve never stopped until a couple weekends ago i m glad i did this little diner is so cute and the food was delish the waitress was super nice and she kept our coffee topped off lrb which is a bid deal to my fiance and i haha rrb they have a real working juke box that you can select music from from what i hear they have car shows there too i ca nt wait to check out one of those shows i ll definitely come back
when i moved away these were the tacos that i missed i stopped back today and must say  it was exactly how i remembered the lunch specials are very reasonably priced at and come with two items and rice and beans i always get the hard taco  seasoned shredded beef lettuce and cheese in a deep fried corn tortilla  and the cheese enchilada i could eat the rice and beans alone both are so well seasoned and they definitely do nt skimp on the cheese the only thing to watch is that the red hot sauce can vary from visit to visit  some days it s super hot others  not so much the wait staff is exceptionally friendly and always try to help me because my spanish is so limited the interior is large but very modest there are nt a lot of fancy decorations  this is a place to come for the food and service and not th ambiance still one of my faves
well this was a pleasant surprise this place is small a little cramped but the food definitely makes up for it when seated the waitress was very attentive and coffee was served almost immediately the menu is small but full of all the basics along with the special of the day my fiance ordered the special while i ordered the salami scramble they are served with toast lrb white wheat sourdough or cinnamon raisin rrb and potatoes lrb hash browns or country fried potatoes rrb we ordered the wheat which was served with a chunk of butter melting between the slices and a small cup of jelly the toast was served almost immediately after taking our order and it was full of nom noms the service is fast and you never have to wait for a waitress to come by there is always someone nearby to help the prices were very good as well the average cost of entrees is between  dollars and the coffee has free refills the amount of food served is just enough to fill you up with out making you feel like a glutton they do nt take reservations and the place is very small with limited seating so either arrive early in the morning or expect to wait a while
i love this library i found out about in fines later that in april you can donate canned food and they trade away your fines i ve been saving food now so by april i will have a bunch but hopefully not big fines again update i had paid off some fines but this april when i went to get my botanical garden pass i dropped off food items and got my last dollars of fines removed woo hoo
spoton diagnostics for a problem that was nothing more than wrong battery size put in by the previous owner of this new to me watch another highly reputed on yelpcom lrb and completely uptight rrb shop diagnosed it as broken movement and estimated five times the cost i found norm s to be very reasonable friendly and professional people with great attitude they took very reasonable time to get the job done and for nothing more than the price of correct battery and its installation they even kept the watch for a few extra hours just to confirm that indeed it is funcitoning correctly i surely recommend them for any watch issues big or small update they also put a pin in another of my watch for a very very reasonable price lrb installed rrb the other highly reputable on yelpcom lrb and unprofessional rrb watch repair shop did not even have the pin in stock or so i was told

my husband and i ate here tonight after buying their groupon a couple weeks ago the service was good and the food was outstanding we tried different appetizers  the cheese borak lrb amazing rrb the hummus with meat lrb delicious rrb and the spinach pies lrb good but not outstanding rrb for our entree we both had the cleopatra platter kebobs  chicken kafta and filet mignon the chicken and kafta were very flavorful the filet was good but not quite as great as the other kebobs by far the best thing on the plate was the garlic dipsauce that came with the chicken a delicious creamy garlic sauce that was good on everything   rrb i highly recommend the restaurant and am very confused by the bad reviews on the restaurant we will for sure be going back the location is kinda in a hidden spot but i hope the restaurant sticks around for awhile i m glad to finally have a good middle eastern place in the area give it a try
quest complete for years we ve been on that quest to find an italian ristorante that fulfills those memories from our youth generous steaming hot portions of wonderfully flavorful italian favorites we wanted to experience those memories and to share them with our kids lrb  rrb who have no frame of reference unfortunately we ve had so many false starts over so many years we ve gotten quite skeptical as mentioned in other reviews the location of roma did nt mitigate our skepticism much around the far corner in a strip mall that is mostly closed up gave us a long moment of pause upon entering our worries were calmed nicely appointed comfortable and inviting we were relieved the menu is familiar yet there are plenty of options you may not expect veal is my favorite dish but i ve been disappointed for over years so i resisted we decided to stay with some classic s caesar salad for an appetizer spaghetti  meatballs lasagna bolognese mostaccioli and chicken cacciatore the busser brought a huge portion of hot toasted bread with herbed butter to get started the herbed butter was a pleasant surprise as we ve found that most chef s overdo it on the herbs the caesar was pleasant tangy and we accepted the offered extra parmesan  ground pepper the food come out as we were all taking our last bites  perfect all four dishes were fantastic healthy steaming hot portions of perfectly cooked pasta hallelujah someone who understands that al dente does nt mean chewy it means firm plenty of gooey melted cheese wonderful sauces hearty meatballs flavors that complemented each dish perfectly we gorged ourselves happy to share with each other the reality that each one of us chose something we really enjoyed what flavors what fun the service was nice not overbearing overly formal rushed or slow the table was well maintained refills came at the appropriate times small talk and smiles were honest and easy a perfect compliment to the meal we had no room for dessert but we still got the outrageous chocolate cake  gone in minute we were stuffed but had lrb rrb boxes heavy with left overs to take and enjoy at home the final treat was the complimentary amaretto aperitifs to cap off the finest italian meal we ve had in over years to top off the entire experience we got to chat with the owners just before leaving it really does nt get any better lrb veal next visit for sure rrb ps well i guess it does get better  after a hour ride back to flagstaff our son decided that he enjoyed his meal so much he could nt wait until the next day so he heated up his left overs before going to bed lrb i think he just wanted to make sure i did nt get to them before he could   rrb

great place for sushi ordered the musscles lrb caution very large order even with only four rrb great wine ordered eel crunch roll tuna roll soft shell crab roll all of it was to die for a little gem pricing is competitive not high or low environment is pleasant service was wonderful and waitress was very helpful with suggestions and information
just a quick update to my review the ownership of leap s has changed though it looks like they are keeping the same look and feel of the place
i did nt expect much going here but left very impressed better than little sheep hot pot california melting pot and swish in lv almost as good as sweet home cafe in honolulu hi
been here twice now and tried two different dogs and two sides nothing was disappointing i have tried both the sweet and spicy dog and the hana dog both dogs were great and had very distinct high points the sweet and spicy does something very rare for me and actually gets me to enjoy pineapple mixed with other foods i this dog had great flavors all over including the dog itself which was perfectly cooked and the right amount of heat the hana was just a stack of messy amazingness that had a real mexican flair the bacon is the real standout adding the great bacon flavor and a crunch that gives the textures some depth the sides were good to the chili is not some canned stuff and is good the tater tots are just awesome though and nice crispy outside and that soft pillowy inside you crave if you want a gourmet hot dog this place is not going to let you down
i am worried about my own lifestyle looking back at how many burger joints i have frequented in the last month but at least they are quality so i can live with it for now with places like this in town why are fast food places still alive  seriously the brainwashers really have a foothold because anything else i just ca nt wrap my head around this place is great the owner is a real genuine dude who loves what he does the burger and fries were fantastic the bacon on it was glorious and the cheese was perfect i got the cheddar but will try swiss next time i have a burger the beef is perfection on a bun fries crispy potato savory heaven i am not a mayo guy so secret sauce always has me skeeved but the owner told me to try it on the side it was okay and spiced well hint of cumin ketchup mayo i m still a ketchup purist but the sauce was nt a deal breaker the place is the real deal i am going back and will update after i have the italian beef somedays you just regret that you only have one stomach
i dine at citizen any night of the week and enjoy taking friends who ve not had the cph pleasure it s hard to explainjustify the greatness of signature chopped salad lrb i end up selling it my dinner mate du jour saying the salad is so good it has its own facebook fan page rrb the location is great in the heart of old town and easy to get to as cph is on the corner of th and craftsman ct the vibe on any going night is easy going no matter how busy it is the familiar faces that do the meet and greet is an added touch being as how i notice with every visit cph is busy the atmosphere lighting is great and so is decor the seats in dining room could be a bit more cushiony to promote more relaxation menu terminologyingredients could be dumbed down a bit diners who are nt the gourmand thankfully my girlfriend erica explained to me what an heirloom potoato is oh i get it when asking what this is on the menu the server can seize the moment to sell the dish to my awaiting tastebuds still it s always a turn on to read and knowimagine what the ingredients are than having to wander chopped salad and pork rind apps are top notch i enjoyed the chicken with risotto the smoke flavor was a bit much chicken and waffles  eh the waffle was had a bit too much buckwheat taste to it mac and cheese would be much tastier if not served with sweet salsa on top i always receive impeccable service when sitting at the bar to eat drinks are great and i appreciate the bartender being constant in his attention to service  detail when i appear i ve been a patron  times now he is singlularly responsible for the nd visit which has turned into unplanned but definite neverending visits to cph i order out here and there from cph when i came in one night to pick up the food he rang me up and i told him to keep the change as i always tip when picking up take out lrb i m in the service business rrb he thanked me and then asked if he could get me a drink while my order was being bagged i pick up all the time and am never asked this by waitstaff this made the difference i enjoyed a shirley temple in a to go cup and naturally he served it without charging i do nt own a large operation like cph but how nice was it be served a non alcoholic beverage grazie again the little added touches are what keeps a customer coming back if only other establishments offered free soft drinks while waiting for food the women s bathroom appears to be cleaned every time i ve had to use lady s room i ve not yet lrb ca nt believe it rrb consumed any dessert i m also wanting to try the grits app every person i ve taken to cph has enjoyed it
peppersauce cafe is one of my favorite places to eat though there are many amazing dishes here my favorite is the pulled pork sandwich it is topped with onion rings and is fantastic i discovered this restaurant about years ago when i was working in the area i have taken many customers and friends there for lunch it s a real home cooked meal for just over the price of what you would get fast food the staff is courteous and remembers who you are i think that s important for businesses anyhow peppersauce gets two thumbs up from me
eat drink repeat this was a wonderful dinner we started with the tortilla espanola and my friend who went to spain recently said it was better than what he had in spain i ordered the salpicon de congrejo and it was very light and refreshing the waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable and down to earth we then ordered the pollo colonial and lomo con romesco the flavor was beyond belief it was so pleasing to the palate my chicken had this wonderful crispiness that was yet still delicate and flavorful my glass of malbec was really good the owner also came to our table and asked how everything was and apologized for it the restaurant temperature being too cold but we did not find it cold so it was great to meet the owner to top it off i had a an almond desert that was unique the music and atmosphere was perfect i ca nt wait to come here again i know some folks have mentioned the portion sizes but i found the key is to order a number of dishes together and share lastly thanks groupon for the introduction this place really stands out
super nice staff every time food is awesome every time
best gyros in phoenix for bucks you get a huge gyros sandwich filled with tasty tzatziki onions and tomatos on the softest pita bread i ve ever had along with a huge side of crispy seasoned fries and a soft drink with free refils my friend got the vegetarian falafel sandwich combo which they let her customize and get dolmadas and spanikopita as her sides along with a delicious greek salad the falafel was nt dry and too crunchy they were soft and perfectly crisp little morsels of greek deliciousness take my word i m from chicago and grew up with a greek family i know my gyros

i have been going here since they opened a few years back and have never once been disappointed everything is super fresh and they are the nicest people ever i am glad to see this place thriving my favorite is the old reliable pho tai i also love getting the crispy eggrolls they come with lettuce cucumber carrots basil and mint to create little eggroll burritos man i am hungry even if you order your food to go they take extra care to pack everything nice and when you get home it is as good as you would have in the restaurant my first review and i chose noodles ranch that has got to say something
we eat here all the time i do nt get why this place got bad reviews by some people on here we have been here weekly lrb at least rrb since it opened  the service is fast  friendly the food is excellent you can choose from a ginormous array of interesting things to put in your salad sure the decor is bland who cares  food is great service is great easy to get to it  is  a little more expensive but if you are in the mood for a good fresh salad this is your place sweet tomatoes  soup or salad are mcdonald s quality this is not
great place to socialize eat good food and drink tasty beer i would definitely reccommend this to people i had a very creative burger called the popper burger which was really good the person i was with also got a burger and said it was really good we tried a few of the beers and were very impressed with them i came on a monday or sunday night and it was busy this is kind of a loud social place so i wouldnt reccommend going here if you re looking for a quiet classy dinner it is a brewing company

i have been looking for a good chinese buffet for a while in my neighborhood and luckily hibachi grill has arrived i have been to few buffets in which the service was as quick friendly and efficient a sumptuously decorated mid century modern chinese decor makes you feel like you are eating at a fancy casino buffet lots of attractive attention to detail so what  i m here for the food only drawbacks  no dumplings  fried or steam or dim sum other than pork bun  which was great however also no duck hoisin or plum sauce and if they did have it it was hard to find but  they had wonderful egg custard tarts that were sublime  i am still obsessing ove them and that made of for what they lacked in other areas and the food did not disappoint great tot and sour soup with a perfect subtle taste of vinegar delicious and hot cheese wontons hell they even had fried sweet plantains that were as good as my cuban mother makes keep in mind it s a buffet and i arrived it was the beginning of lunch so everything was hot and fresh they offer the usual suspects from standard buffet fare but all in high quality lots of shrimp and beef and although i did not try the hibachi grill it looked very appetizing with lots of happy diners waiting in line to get their fix the sushi bar was well stocked and fresh remember it s a buffet not ra in scottsdale it was all very fresh no low sodium soy sauce  so what all that as well as flavors of very premium ice cream for god i love america for a chinese buffet with this price for lunch it is as good as it gets i walked out after meeting my new yelp friends rand norm mike robyn and lynn extremely happy satisfied and pleased as a pig i will be back
wow so nice and shiny inside went to see the swell season here and they sang a couple of songs off mike and their voices carried very well through the entire theater acoustically speaking quite an accomplishment no security guards just little old lady s showing you to your seat so i guess you could bum rush the stage and start a mosh pit if you really felt the need too i ll check the schedule and see what they have playing soon and then get a dressed up and act adult like for the evening  for a change bad news they they had only two bars with one server each for the whole event
a little island of sanity in the scottsdale club scene this small bar is located a few block east of suede and has no cover lrb at the time rrb furnished with a combination of tables an bar chairs and coffee tables and couches it is a relaxing yet sophisticated it has a rap for being too upscale but it doesnt feel that way when your there its just not a meat market lots of singles there but its more of a laid back feel rather than high pressure selling lrb translation expect to talk to lots of people but leave your cheezeball lines at home rrb
i love this place so many options when it comes to side dishes instead of just frys as far as the custard goes their is many options you can do as far as topping it s it close to me but i do nt mind taking the drive
this has been a favorite of mine since college days it still is a great climb lrb sorry elle t rrb for those wondering if they would like to climb for a date or just a sunday activity it is a bit intense and a very long uphill climb the steps are are big steps you will need to be able to negotiate big spaces you will or at least i was huffing and puffing like crazy and i hike thunderbird park every weekend but i felt like i was dying it takes about an hour if you are on the constant move with breaks it s understandably a bit longer but once you endure you feel like you are on top of the world it is a blast to sit on top and see literally everything in the valley here are a few tips before going take water lots of water wear sunscreen you have little shade wear sensible shoes no flip flops no converse you need sturdy people on the uphill traditionally have the right of way do nt take the kids there are edges with no railings and you can get hurt bring a cell phone you or someone else might need help if you have health problems do nt go
i m not generally a big fan of burgers but i love this place their blu burger is amazing bleu cheese crumbles carmelized onions and thick crispy bacon on an awesome onion bun oh my i highly recommend adding avocado to it as well i ca nt speak for the other sandwiches because i love the blu burger too much to order anything new heh the zucchini fries are a thing of beauty and they allow wellbehaved dogs to hang out with you on the patio while you enjoy your meal they even brought my little guy a disposable water bowl i ve also had great luck with their waitstaff everyone is friendly and on task it s pretty busy on a friday or saturday night but just perfect for a saturday afternoon lunch

the distinguished puertorican writer and political advocate lola rodriguez de tio in her publication of the poem a cuba said cuba y puerto rico son de un pajaro las dos alas lrb cuba and puerto rico are the two wings of a bird rrb and for those of us living far away from our beloved islands the havana cafe offers the perfect mixture of culture food flavors music and atmosphere especially when one does nt feel like getting in the kitchen or catching the next flight to san juan pricey  yes like any other premium service of its kind delicious and as authentic as one can find miles away from home do nt forget to try the arroz con gandules  it is phenomenal sorry mom
this restaurant is by the far the most unique restaurant i have ever eaten at i love the concept taking the vernacular of southwest native american flavors and incorporating it into fine cuisine the heart of this restuarant is the fact that they use local seeds local flowers local everything to make the food so extraordinary i always request the corner table at teh junction of the windows at aorund pm to get the best sunset views possible then the experience begins every waiter knows your name everything is not overlooked food is beyond exceptional and the location is classic az if i could i would add another diamond on top of the it s already received thank you kai and sheraton whp for putting together an unforgettable restaurant
love their pizzas thin crust and it just smells heavenly it s the pizza i remember from my childhood their menu does nt have the standard pepperoni etc but pizza margherita and a couple of other specialty pizzas i plan to eventually try their other menu items but as of now they re my favorite neighborhood pizza place
amazing soups and sandwiches i love this place you ca nt go wrong with the bread bowls mmmmm excellent catering service too they were on time and every order was nicely labeled and bagged for each person in our person group
every time i head to abc cake supply i see this wonderful store on the way i often say i need to stop there today i did it is a wonderful ecclectic store filled with unique items from baby wedding kitchen and on i picked up some of their mini cupcake stands love
this is a regular lunch spot for me and my coworkers if you go in at lunch time you will see that it is a regular place for a lot of people it can get very busy but the staff does a great job of providing top notch service even when packed i am not an expert on thai food but i have not tried anything there that was nt outstanding it is really hard to come up with a favorite just try any of the lunch specials and you ca nt go wrong one word of warning they let you pick your level of spiciness and i find that if you are sensitive to spicy food you might want to be a bit conservative
i took my runner in for a general tune up and some preventative maintenance they were extremely friendly they took their time to explain my options in a way that made sense to me and the final bill was reasonable they were courteous of my time so i did nt have to wait around at all also when i had some questions about something after the service they were great i was invited back to the shop where they listened to my concern and double checked that everything was okay and it was thanks whitey s
liberty market is my favorite place to go for good coffee good food good people the staff makes that place what it is they are friendly efficient and just genuinely good people the espresso bar is by far my most favorite part of this establishment you always meet a new person at that bar while enjoying a nice cup of coffee i typically work on my laptop while there and chat with the baristas and other patrons the food is beyond delicious most entres are very filling and do yourself a favor and try the red velvet cake they always have something new from the baker worth trying the owners are all great people who will do anything for their customers like previous posts do yourself a favor and check out the bathrooms i prefer the chef s see you at the e bar

our experience goes back to in anaheim we got a window table so we could watch the fireworks across the street at disneyland the fireworks continued to the food my thai wrap was extraextrodinarily delicious i got the fruit salad we were completely mesmerized by the bourbon street jazz funky new orleansstyle decor and the absolutely magnificent service fast forward to santa clarita ca where we ordered and they brought the wrong dish without batting an eye our waitress quickly took away the wrong dish and brought the right one with an extra loaf of that sweet dark bread coated in oatmeal fast forward again to chandler az where we live now we have ordered almost everthing on the dinner menu and always been satisfied with the taste texture and amount lrb always take some home rrb next to celebrate my st birthday my wife and i are taking our friends to have breakfast will let you know about that later all the best to everyone who loves mimi s
wow i have been driving past this place for eons barely giving it a second thought what a fool i ve been veneto trattoria is insanely good i m talkin really delicious italian food who knew apparently two other yelpers i guess i should have looked this place up on yelp like a good little yelper would and then i would have known a while ago that i should check this place out everything i had here was excellent  the app the entree the dessert  all delicious i had the bruschetta the spinach ravioli and affogato lrb espresso and scotch flavors with chocolate chips on ice cream rrb i also got to try my boyfriend s food and everything was delicious as well this place is my new favorite restaurant and if the weather allows they have this perfect little patio with twinkling lights for you to dine in
hands down the best italian restaurant i have ever been to marcellino s has the most romantic atmosphere i have ever seen in a restaurant tucked away in scottsdale this little gem is the real deal in fact it took me extra long to order because the entire menu was in italian the place holds bars intimate seating in both booths and sperate tables for dates and romantic getaways candlelit tables attentive wait staff fancy place settings live music etc this place has it all i went here on a lrb not so great rrb first date with a guy i met at a bar and he easily dropped on appetizers fancy water beers gigantic entrees and dessert plus lrb hopefully rrb a generous tip i had the stuffed torteillini because i am a total sucker for lots of pasta expecting it to come in a bowl of a bunch of smaller shells it was actually very large rolls drinched in this heavenly white sauce i loved it and so did my date he ate off my plate we also order the capriesse salad which came with a beautiful ripe tomato and a fat slice of parmesan too the dressing was light but flavored enough that not much pepper was needed i can not wait to go back to this place on a different date with a different guy but only if he s paying

my parents took me here to celebrate my college graduation and had they taken me here before they got me a present there would have been no need this was place amazing i love the atmosphere of the small house this is a huge part of its charm the staff was kind and friendly and very personable they unexpectedly brought out a desert for me with a congratulations graduate inscribed with chocolate sauce lrb bonus rrb on the outer rim of the plate the service alone would make me come back but the food oh my god the food i had no expectations going to this restaurant as i had no idea what it was or that we were even going until an hour before i arrived i had no time to do research and i trust my parents palate to have chosen a sufficient place for dinner lrb they did pretty good being from texas thanks to you yelpers rrb what we ordered to start the brie brulee  incredible three onion tart  from the one bite i was able to sneak in from my dad lrb who fell in love at first taste rrb it was delicious i had the salmon which was wonderful flaky and moist and the creme sauce was devine i do nt think i expected it to be as heavy as the dish was but even so wonderful i would probably have enjoyed it more if it were cold outside my dad ordered the lamb shank and it was falling off the bone i had never had lamb until that day and i m glad my first time was at coup des tartes it was savory and succulent and with the vegetables it came with reminded me of a stew my mom had the pasta and it was just right very light and flavorful which paired well with the wine we brought my brother ordered the chicken and while it was one of the simpler dishes it was the best tasting of them all the execution from start to finish is something that will not go unmentioned when i recommend this little gem keep up the great work i ca nt wait to come back
i stopped eating hot dogs years ago too scary too salty too mysterious but all that changed with my first exposure to short leash hot dogs i am not an overboard foodie who likes bleu cheese on a hot dog i am a purist call me oldfashioned call me a traditionalist but i like my hot dogs basic mustard only i love that they do nt give me a sad look when i order they just deliver a great dog that fills the length of the superb nan bread perfectly prepared no mustard drips on my lap childhood is a state of mind and when i take a short leash bite i m zapped back to ball games with my dad summer days at the pool memories of the real thing as good as it gets phoenix is so lucky to have them
my favorite sushi restaurant ever i love their ama ebi nigiri lrb sweet shrimp rrb and always craving for more for this visit i tried their dynamite scallop roll and salmon roll lrb with asparagus inside rrb and it was so delicious makes me craving for more the pork ribs were very delicate and it was melting in your mouth what makes this restaurant to be my number one spot of japanese restaurant in the valley was the sushi chef service is superb they ran out ama ebi and i told the waitress that one of the reason i came there is for that ama ebi the chef suddenly came back to me one hour later and said he saved one ama ebi for me what a service i m so thankful of this wonderful dining experience and will definitely become one of their regular customer love this place so much
awesome i had pho with welldone brisket and it was great i have a favorite vietnamese pho place that is zagat rated back in philadelphia and the pho at unphogettable was very similar the noodles are perfect and the broth was delicious the meat was also very tender melted in your mouth and had no fat the soup came with basil lime sprouts and jalapeos like usual which were all very fresh the service was great also always had a drink food came out fast and very friendly servers and owners great place for pho lovers i will definitely be going back
this place is very small and inviting i had to wait for a little while for my table but it was worth the wait the sea scallops were amazing on the appetizer menu and i had the best bolognase with homemade fettuccine pasta  they actually made the pasta in house wine list was great too  good mix i will become a regular here for sure
i have to say the most annoying person on tv right now is flo you know that perky bitch pitching for progressive insurance ugh i just want to smash her face in because her voice is like chewing on aluminum foil while scraping your nails on a chalkboard that said i almost want to get rear ended again get your mind out of the gutter folks i was stopped at a red light recently when the man behind me decided to go and ran his mercedes right into me within ten days hamilton my now buddy at progressive came to my house and cut me two checks for damages to my car and damages to my back if i was nt so happy with my little gecko insurer i would consider progressive course they d need to dump flo dump flo  ewww that sounds gross
went last night awesome environment great art amazing food if you like vietnamese would recommend the seafood soup and the egg rolls byob which i love
i do nt think i have anything to share that has nt already been posted in previous reviews the food here is stellar  quality ingredients great flavor and nothing cookiecutter the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting service is friendly quick and everything one should expect i absolutely love visiting this place and encourage you to do so as well if you have nt already i am one of the lucky ones who has never had to wait more than seconds for a table  i m not sure how that s worked out but it has and i m grateful that said i would gladly wait an hour to enjoy some great breakfast fare at matt s i m looking forward to trying lunch one day too

we love ted s and the great grilled pork hot dogs plus all there other items but a ted s hot dog is the best since moving west from upstate ny we are looking for a pork hot dog lrb not a sonoran but true all pork rrb like you find at ted s we are in the tucson area and we really wish a ted s would open up here does anyone know outside of ted s where one can find a real pork hot dog in this region  the best we can do now is order from a website called buffalofoodcom appreciate any info thanks
i love this place i love sitting outside here the seating is very comfortable the atmosphere is very laid back and elegant even though they were busy at the time our waiter was very attentive i had the gnocchi soup for the first time i am sad that i ca nt find a place that could compare to that of nick s gnocchi i also had the caesar salad which was yummy this is such a nice place for a date or a night out with the family this is also my grandfathers favorite restaurant in phoenix
we decided to check out coach house last night for a few drinks to celebrate my husband s th birthday we love dive to slighty diveish bars as they usually have cheap drinks interesting character and personality and a good jukebox coach house fits all three of those criteria the bartenders were extremely friendly and chitchatted with us a bit the clientele is quite mixed but it was great to see tons of people singing along to the jukebox without a care in the world someone definitely loaded up on the michael jackson selections that the jukebox offers as we heard a couple of mj songs from back in the day lrb you know when he was black and had a nose rrb it definitely looks like christmas threw up inside coach house but it gives it character and personality which i appreciate i know i will definitely be back to coach house because any bar that opens at am gets an a in my book
i know that there has been a lot of controversy surrounding fresh and easy and whether it s really as fresh and easy environmentally friendly or as organic as it bills itself to be i ll leave that whole discussion for the talk threads and just focus on why from a shopping and eating perspective i absolutely love this market first of all because my husband and i love food so much we tend to eat out and crave restaurant dining more than we should to be friendly on the wallets and our waistlines because fresh and easy has such a variety of goodquality frozen and preprepared options that can easily be combined to create a meal i m a lot happier eating at home and the total price is much less than we would pay going out as an example we combined their refrigerated vegetable samosas lrb rrb with their frozen paneer meal lrb  also comes with rice and green beans rrb and some naan lrb rrb and had a delicious easy indian meal for about person the other thing i love about this place is how unlike at trader joe s certain gourmet or more exotic ingredients are staples and not special buys for a specified time period before moving to phoenix my husband and i made trader joe s our gourmet market of choice but would get very frustrated if we went there to get dinner supplies and found everything but basil and fresh thyme and had to make another stop at fresh and easy however things like creme fraiche thai garlic  chili sauce and herbs stay in stock so you can do all of your shopping for a recipe in one place and then there s just the deliciousness factor  many things i ve randomly tried  red pepper hummus preprepared flan espresso fudge ice cream and fresh grapefruit juice  have just been that  delicious it s wonderful to feel that grocery shopping can tantalize you just as much as trying a new restaurant of course i do nt think that fe would be as wonderful if it were nt right on th ave and baseline four minutes from my house and i still love whole foods but i find fe much more exciting and enjoyable of a shopping experience than a regular market or trader joe s
i love this place the food is always good and the pastas are plenty and full of meat i alwyas will go there
we stopped in after a movie to check out the soft opening they have it together with friendly and attentive staff pizza was excellent  great flavor and fast delivery out of their great looking wood burning oven their local brews taste great  the cream ale is spot on  also nice guest brews on tap  leg humper hefe is next best thing to a franziskaner lots of parking in the back  expect this place to do very well simple menu good value and cold beer check it out 
hooray for mastro s this is by far the best location in the country although i have visited virtually every location in the country lrb with the exception of the thousand oaks mastro s rrb no one does it like the scottsdale ocean club i am really looking forward to visiting the brand new location in chicago next week they generally have at least different fresh fish on the menu with the option of being cooked different ways you can enjoy a cocktail and a live lounge music cover singer in the bar area get there early because you will want to spend your entire evening savoring the food the waitstaff is over the top pleasant and engaging i love the ocean club it gets an a                in service the food is grand and the space is comfortable i d trade my most expensive pair of shoes for that butter cake recipe yum
really cool local place checked it out during spring training before heading to the giants game i read the great reviews so i got a little of everything to try it out a soup sandwich and smoothie the soup was excellent gourmet quality on par with a top restaurant the smoothie was excellent very fresh and refreshing more of the lowdairy lowpowder high fruit type smoothie that is really cold and icey and has a sugary bite to it like you might make at home with a blender and some fresh fruit on the sandwich i think i called a bad audible as i read their cali club was great on my phone then arrived to order and saw that included egg but i wanted lunch so i switched to the turkey club although the turkey club had quality ingredients i think the strong flavor of the whole wheat bread overwhelmed the subtle flavor of the turkey which made the sandwich less flavorful overall however my friends said their sandwiches and coffee were great and they made a good tuna sandwich i think my friends and i will definitely return in future springs
so good sooooo freakin good
i have been to olive  ivy many times for happy hour and dinner but my first time for brunch i went with some girlfriends and it was a perfect springtime girls gettogether i had the cinnamon french toast which was amazing and my friends had the mixed berries with yogurt also delish i was surprised at the portions lrb large rrb and the price lrb reasonable rrb would love to go back for brunch and try something new
what s not to love about frozen yogurt with every imaginable topping available to add  i have never experienced such a fun you make it how you want it experience it is totally kid friendly you can leave your artwork on the walls they provide and they have outdoor tables as well be sure to ask for a yolove card lrb buy get one free rrb and try out the liquid marshmallow on your yogurt some time yummy you can sample before you select your yogurt and you pay by ounce not as scary as it seems i get a good amount of yogurt with lots of toppings for under so be adventurous and give yo love a try you wo nt regret it

i moved to san antonio in the same year rudy s country store added barbq to their grocery store there was no inside seating and no airconditioning you sat outdoors next to the fire and usually smelled like wood smoke when you left soon there were lines out the openair counter and ranch hands and dentists stood in line with all the other lovers of fine texas barbq i thought i had died and gone to heaven when steve freidkin owner of texaz grill told me lrb at the robert earl keen concert rrb phoenix had a rudy s i was in line the next day for lunch almost everything felt like home and many others thought so too the line snaked thru the restaurant and out the door just like home i give it a  the only concern was that the brisket tasted like it had been cooked in a new pit  which it had takes time to season the pit with lots of good wood and smoke from the meat to produce the right flavor but its pretty dang close closest thing to authentic anywhere in az
my wife and i seem to be on the hunt for the perfect breakfast place here in north scottsdale many to choose from and butters is our new favorite first of all the atmosphere on the patio was our first hint that we d like it here there is a fountain right off the back and the sounds and smells that make for a pleasant experience they were also playing fun music on the patio as well nothing loud or obnoxious but it was a welcomed addition on a sunday morning secondly this is somewhat like a cafe they have a barista bar there and the latte my wife got was very tasty and my coffee was very excellent our meals were very good as well when it comes to breakfast foods you do nt need to reinvent the wheel they served good food and at a good price and great atmosphere we will definitely be back  update  we went back again this sunday and had another great experience the service was awesome and the food was even better i went out on a limb and tried something i usually would nt get the corned beef hash skillet topped with over easy eggs it was amazing it also was a lot of food i ate about half of it but i am so glad i tried it

first let s be clear i m no gym rat i have a series of unsubstantiated fears that range from dropping a weight on my forehead to flying off the treadmill and ending up in a heap in front of some super jock and in this particular joint i also have a fear of looking fat so when my husband and i won a free membership to the dc ranch village health club i was like whatever sure we ll go but i wo nt like it well he got addicted to squash lrb how completely snooty huh rrb and made fast friends with a crew of really great guys while i got addicted to yoga and have made squat for friends but i m very centered and at peace thank you very much the yoga room has an amazing ceiling lighting system and the club attracts some of the valley s best yoga instructors my favorite time to go is on sundays when katie teaches a yoga class followed by restorative yoga class that s all stretching and laying there like a big cat i practically float out of the room after those hours and do nt even care that my au naturel boobs are nt alarmingly perky and my butt shakes a bit when i walk

love it love it love it i have been eating at various pita jungles around the valley since i moved to az over years ago and i have yet to have anything that i did nt love my favorites include the black bean burger lentil fetoosh salad all three hummus types dolmas and gazpacho but everything is delicious so you really ca nt go wrong the tempe location also has breakfast which is amazing each location is fairly small so luch and dinner may require a short wait but its worth it the prices are fair and the portions are huge do nt be afraid to split a dish with a loved one

my friend and fellow yelper robyn n put together a little birthday uye for me at this amazing buffet we were joined by jeromy h and scott w and of course my daughter claire this is by far the best buffet i have been to in years since it was a sunday we induged in the mimosas and bloody mary s they offered with our meal walking into the buffet area was like walking into a food dream there was the usual salad offerenings and some different soups and several different areas of asian food with my daughter s favorite fried shrimp as well as my favorite coconut shrimp there was an omelet station delicious bacon and yummy potatoes i had the best salmon i have ever had it was like butter and metled in your mouth and there was pizza made right there in the pizza oven my daughter and i watched and they made her a special pizza of her favorite topping black olives she loved it there were so many choices and everything was delicious and desert omg they have a gelato station with about different flavors i tried the limoncello and it was delicious there was pie and cake and pudding and cookies my daughter was in heaven we had a great time with good friends and delicious food i ca nt wait to go back
this is actually a really good boston market if you ask me i have found the customer service to be excellent and well above my expectations on more than one occasion one young gentleman named trevor was very helpful and gave us some great information about catering for a special event one of the times we went he checked in on us to see how the food was and cleared our table and made sure we had everything we needed i was quite impressed the food is also always really good at boston market the brownies are addictive i love how the fountain coke always tastes really good here and better than it does at other quick restaurants i also like their drink cups a lot
always very busy and a min drive for me to get here since i live in gilbert but really i dont even care everything about this place it so worth it the important part though is their coffee best coffee i have ever had ever they have a yummy breakfast menu everything i have every ordered is yummy including their crepes lunch is good and have to try their pizza i always saw a couple of phoenix sun s players there which is nice also since i am a suns fan
yum another wonderful evening at amano s great food friendly staff and in case you did nt know tuesday is  off bottle wine night we shared a fabulous cabernet from their great selection hmmm see you next tuesday
 all you can eat sushi how can you go wrong  the place is not too big and has a homey feel the workers there are all awesome i mean really awesome one of my new favorite habits going to try to make it at least once a month
mmmmmmm sandwiches anytime i hear mention of pane bianco my mouth waters that remarkably simple and successful formula that has made pizzeria bianco so famous has once again been executed to perfection in this little restaurant off of central they are only open for lunch lrb ampm rrb and i recommend avoiding stopping by during the height of lunch hour on a side note there is no indoor dining seating is limited to wooden tables and benches out front that are shared with the customers of lux i always introduce friends and coworkers to this place and everytime we leave its the same reaction wow during my last visit to pane bianco i took a coworker who had never been there while we were waiting the owner comes rolling in with a basket of fresh veggies that looked amazing does he grow this in his garden  did he sign a deal with the devil  i dont know how he does it i usually go for the mozzarella local tomato  basil sandwich this thing is crazy delicious and when people say fresh they mean it its perfect and the bread is insanely delicious lrb chewy and crunchy all at the same time rrb the same goes for any sandwich you might choose here also if you love to just chow on some fresh baked bread like i do grab a baguette they are and ca nt be beat this place is a winner and you will be glad you tried it
love it here it was my nd time there but the first for the rest of the family very peaceful and serene great photography opportunities very educational as a family of four midwesterners we loved walking around looking at the beautifully designed and cared for desert landscape we paid about to get in for a year old year old and two adults both times i ve gone it has taken me about hours to very leisurely walk the entire gadens with a stop for something to drink and relax we saw plants that looked like they were from another planet we saw lizards too i highly recommend a visit stay for sunset it s beaituful
soooo i got injured after flying a long day trip last year and my ortho surgeon and my physical therapist both feel my running days are past me ha both think i need to just stick with an elliptical okay ill think about it as i look at the jiggle making its way up my short dwarf legs im thinking more and more i tried running a trail and my knees were throbbing wahhh where is my youth going  so down to dicks i go after the disaster at sports authority where no one helps with machines  well dicks has their own trainers in that expensive section mark and i were lucky and got teejay he knew his ellipticals he showed us the proform the livestrong lrb i personally have a crush on lance since seeing him win twice in paris rrb and sole his wife has the same knee issues as i and that made me feel im not alone in missing my running days we didnt throw down the k plus on the elliptical quite then but if and when we do we wont be at the sucky sports authority we will be at dicks with the good sales and trainers who know the products they have a good section of running shoes too for when i do go against my surgeon and get out on the trail   rrb
the prices are high but i ve never complained about spending money here the deli club is by far the best sandwich i ve ever eaten everything is fresh and simple i ca nt say enough good things about this place
i know kerrie through my networking and we benefit from her presence i have not needed her service s and most of us do nt plan on needing an attorney but i am always reminded by a tagline that kerrie often mentions people in crisis need company droban  company how very true when that time comes and in these troubled days it will you will need good company i would look for kerrie to help and so should you
loved this store it so lives up to it s name cute clothes great shoe selection too it was very affordable have to say it s now one of my favorites
who can resist the taste from childhood which sometimes calls to you at pm on a random week night  i like it simple a chocolate or caramel dipped cone yup that s it nothing fancy and how can you resist like of the last horsey rides for cents left on earth  lrb yes it play highhosilver rrb lrb i m not sure who gets more joy me or the child i put on it  or maybe i sorta try to sneak on it rrb
i m in love with tubing the salt river i have fun every time i come it s super easy and affordable if you are looking for a good time and a great way to cool off in the az heat come here but be prepared for a long trip down the river which means lots of sunblock and you will need drinking water and if you can bring tp that might be a good idea too keep the river clean by the end of the season the river is always trashed oh yeah and i recommend leaving behind anything valuable chances are you ll lose it rrb
omfg we love this place eating here reminds me of eating at some little cafe on state street in santa barbara it s quiet and quaint and has a very local down to earth vibe sure the parking is a bit tight but there is plenty of parking in the surrounding neighborhood and we did nt mind walking for a few minutes from our car on a beautiful sunday afternoon the breakfast menu is reasonable and the food is worth every penny and then some we tried the french pancakes lrb crepes rrb with fresh fruit and the croque madame and the venice beach burrito all were exceptional and left us wanting more before we had finished our meal we were planning our next trip to la grand orange the grocery store inside is cute and has fun trinkets and specialty sauces and food that a lot of people were buying although it was bustling with business there was plenty of seating outside in the garden area which was perfect on such a beautiful afternoon and one final note ifwhen you do visit this place you must must must try their famous home made english muffins ohhhh they are good we tried one and ended up buying a whole pack of them before we left it s like nothing that you have ever bought in the store and once you try them you will be hooked we ca nt wait to go back again soon
my review is for the location in terminal it opened recently and took the place of an ice cream spot that i never saw anyone at the service here is great and the food is very tasty they offer a wide variety of choices including sandwiches breakfast items pastries and cookies it s a great place to pick up something to eat before your flight

perfect atmosphere perfect staff perfect location perfect drinks why am i here instead of there you ask  i have to make otherwise i d be at itb
why on earth would i review a starbucks right  i mean lets face it starbucks experiences are fairly run of the mill anyone who has nt had a beverage from starbucks has probably just crawled out of their bomb shelter because their year supply of freeze dried astronaut food has run out once they get over the shock that the  big one never hit and there is no longer a ussr they will quickly have their first starbucks experience but i digress i have one reason to leave this review the girl that ran drive thru that one time i went knocked my m fing socks off i do nt often do starbucks however i am a sucker for one thing you put the word salted in front of caramel and i am there starbucks did just that so there i was looking for a salted caramel mocha fix before class no time so i chose drive thru where i was greeted by the most chipper voice i have ever encountered now one might think  well yeah if i was surrounded by untold amounts of caffeine i too would be perky at work but no my friends this was a whole new level of happy whoville had nothing on her the grinch would have had no shot stealing cheer from this drive thru his heart would have exploded her sunny disposition would not have simply defeated the grinch it would have made him dead she commended my salted caramel choice i felt proud she suggested a venti which is far too much caffeine for me but i could not resist she said i deserved it and i believed her she was excited to swipe my credit card complimented my hair and handed me my beverage i did nt even need that coffee her personality was infectious i was ready to carpe diem or yolo for the younger crowd then someone stole my parking spot at school and that was over but i still had the coffee and it was good either way that girl whose name i do nt know that one time i went to this starbucks knocked my socks off and for that i thank her
two friends and i had big bowls of delicious pho here and the total bill for the three of us was beat that
really great yogurt with a variety of toppings i will definitely be returning
i have a fond place in my heart for this establishment i ve been covering my all white meat rice bowls in their sticky spicy teriyaki sauce for  years i ve lived all over the world i always crave three things when i m not living in phoenix lrb or the usa rrb skim milk mexican food tokyo express now pay attention if you like spicy food and teriyaki sauce here s what you should order an all white spicy chicken teriyaki bowl extra sides of spicy sauce a small salad extra sides of salad dressing ok so i really like sauce really this place makes me want to cry i love it so much
best night in snotsdale was spent at the lodge hot damn they have the best wings fried pickles nom nom nom plus i devoured the sasquatch burger two grilled cheese sandwiches that replace a traditional bun on a meaty juicy patty plunged with a knife paired with sweet potato fries the food was wonderful and drinks were strong our server was such a doll so cute and friendly i laughed like hell seeing a grown man piss himself i gave him a pass it was spring training week bore meer bore meer take me drunk i m home he chanted the lodge seems to help tone down the snooty up tight girls that do nt play well with others who are not in their socioeconomic strata i am not innocent here i pretty much get along with anyone and everyone men want me women want to be me lrb enter sarcasm here rrb but i guess i really pissed a few patrons off after i ordered stimulus packages i can of pbr i shot of cheap whisky and one cigg all for just washington s i went outside to smoke my cigg ended up taking one puff cough cough and passed it on to someone else outside patio consisted of testosterone fist pumping young men total diva s and an intense corn hole match in progress young hipsters living the thug life mainly packs of shewolves makes sense being that we are enjoying a night at the lodge so i come across a post note pack behind the bar of course i am buzzed as hell and started writing compliments and posting them on random kids i come across two battle axes one is a playful tease and the other has a much nastier tone i wrote you have really great hair the spitfire looked at me rolled her eyes and barked die really die are we on the th grade playground  let s just say she was not very effective at delivering witty comebacks oh wow  i vacationed in the hamptons i wield catty vixens for years girly this is not my first rodeo so i giggle and get out my trusty pen and write you have a hairy vag oh it gets better i pass the note to an innocent bystander a cute young man and politely asked him to give my friend her note she left ha ha ha ha ha ha i did post note a cute gentlemen with out him knowing he actually came over and found me the post it bandit lrb i hope i really did light your fire and your back to your post it website rrb would i go back  effin ay i would  fun night great food strong drinks and the majority of the crowd was chill
probably about stars but a bonus star for having old speckled hen on tap sooo creamy and delicious i had dinner here with the family before i flew back to san jose the miso sea bass was delicious service was great and pretty empty on a late sunday afternoon good beer selection prices seemed a bit high good thing my dad picked up the tab  p
cork is an enigma what makes it enigmatic is how damn good it is too good for chandler and maybe too good for the valley the portions are just right and anybody that tells you otherwise is a fat ass or a glutton lrb i m lbs and i was satisfied rrb if you want large portions though go to their lunchbrunches i ve been there twice and had the lamb chop which was amazing on all levels and i ve had some serious lamb in rural bosnia which has been labeled the best in their country sure enough cork s stood up blow for blow the other entre i experienced was the buttermilk fried chicken i was so amazed by the lamb the first time that i had to try something more simple in order to qualify their food in regards to regular places let s just say the chicken was not regular it was outstanding the appetizers are crazy good can anyone say king crab legs  the wine selection is top notch the booze selection is killin and they even make this amazing italian lemon stuff that s like  alcohol make sure you have a designated driver because this place will inspire winos and boozers to indulge to their fullest go to cork because it s that damn good
we have been here several time excellent food and service love it orange chicken is so good
this is a great place to get a protein packed chicken sandwich fast the people that work here are friendly and the drive thru moves pretty fast i only wish they were open on sundays for my afternoon workout post meal other than that i like this place and that says a lot coming from me only downside is that it does get pricey but you get what you pay for and it s better than mcdonalds lrb which i never eat rrb
they have a steer named horny seriously a live long horn just chilling outside the restaurant i am not sure if this is a beef freshness indicator or just for the kids but it is a cool touch nonetheless the view of the sunset was fabulous this place screams rustic wild west while yielding gourmet five star fare thank you for a fantastic finale to our work trip
went to yogurt kingdom for the first time tonight it was perfect lots of flavors to choose from my favorite is the tart vanilla but i got a large cup and tasted at least different flavors and i enjoyed each and everyone i wanted to go back and get some more of the tart vanilla but my husband gave me one of those looks when i suggested it you can either eat inside or outside the place is decorated so cute there was a very cute and well mannered girl to greet us and told us how it all worked just in case we had not been there before they offered to give us any samples that we might like to try there was a gentleman there who turned out to be the owner he was very kind friendly person and glad that we stopped in the bathroom was very clean and the entire place was tidy and well maintained we will be back very soon i would recommend this place to others that like yogurt you wo nt be disappointed
jersey mike s is in my opinion as good as it gets yes they have the whole it all started in as a family business at the jersey shore thing going for it lrb you know before mtv and a halfdozen wannabe dlisters made anything connected to the jersey shore look bad rrb and they also do a lot for charity  both at the corporate level and a little closer to home on the franchise level and all that s well and good but it would nt mean anything if the food sucked right  no worries there  i ve not had a bad sandwich there the bread is fresh as are all of the other ingredients and it s all sliced fresh when you order it it s not like subway where they put a slice of meat and a slice of cheese on the sandwiches  they pile it on cold subs hot subs wraps  i ve enjoyed all of the sandwiches i ve tried  not something i can say about some other sandwich shops i ve been to if i had to pick a couple of favorites i d say the  lrb roast beef rrb and the chicken caesar wrap one nit to pick  i with there were a  size  sometimes the  regular is nt big enough but the  giant is too big the parking at this particular location can be a bit challenging at times because it s small and a little tight but the sandwiches are worth it and the starbucks next door usually has marble loaf in their display case
let me say that this is by far the best thai food i have had in phoenix the atmosphere is great very friendly staff we were seated right away and made to feel right at home i had the strawberry champagne martini it was very well made i must say this place is great for a first date anniversary or valentines the owner is wonderful i recommend this place as a romantic spot for a couple i will continue to go back as long as they are opened
one thing i have to say best bruschetta ever
well oconnor s is out of the loop for me since i live in tempe i hate to even have a couple beers and drive that far home lrb  rrb with the legal limit being lowered because they could nt get enough convictions at it s sad sad nation that continues to wage war with it s people on so many levels on to the good times oconnor s is a pretty nice pub right off the at the dunlap exit all in all oconnor s is a good place where as the sign says you re only a stranger once the long bar seats around and there are tables high top tables and booths also there s a great mural on the wall listing the counties of ireland with a stage for live music in front of it the standards pool table jukebox smoking patio lrb with secret back door smoke spot rrb and some bar food in crockpots lrb free food baby rrb there s always a rollins fan there and when i m there of them the bartender s have been pleasant enough and on weekends there is table service they have a nice selection on tap guinness smithwick s lrb monk bear yay rrb samuel adams lrb bux all the time rrb and bass bass  i once went in an irish pub called the pour house in carnegie pa and ordered a bass and was admonished by the bartender that s an english beer and this is an irish bar so i looked up at the bottles on the shelf and ordered a corona d even though i took a star for distance i will not hold that over their head that s my own quirk not drinking and driving ha they still get stars
a rather unlikely location for new asian fast food lrb in sun lakes  rrb but asian grill is a real find wonderful lettuce wraps and probably the best hot and sour soup we ve found in the valley
when i heard about the restaurant while getting my haircut it sounded very intriguing and interesting when i heard that the chefowner was a one man show i truly wondered how the service would be i pictured an i love lucy episode well i went last night and my world was rocked so much in fact that selfishly i did nt want to tell more people i know i know it s not about me so here i am writing it rocked the ambiance the service the artistry of the plate the quality of the taste of the food was all amazing icing on the cake the one man show chefowner christopher was also very warm funny quick witted and on top of it all i ll be back marc g
i find it hilarious that someone would reference this place as being terrible compare it to lrb overpriced and bland rrb humble pie and in the same breath say it was the best chili relleno you ever tasted i ca nt vouch for the chicken tacos but most street tacos are nowhere near packed with meat by definition they are usually very tiny with onions some guacamole a little cabbage and some small cuts of meat i can say the tilapia tacos are tops lrb large filet on each rrb on the list of my girlfriend s quest for good fish tacos i can say the pork nachos are the best i have had as the pork reminds me of los dos molinos in a small way the empanadas are excellent as well if you go for happy hour you can get two empanadas for bucks you can also get large fish tacos for bucks would you like some awesome tortilla soup  bucks if you get the dinner version of the emapanadas with a large portion of some of the best rice and a side of black beans i think it sets you back about bucks i have also had the chili relleno and it is the best i have tasted as well leaving me to wonder with the single review you have for anything why the venom  i learned long ago to ask for what is recommended for before you order and if someone recommends a place try what they are harping about first when i asked they said the chili relleno pork empanadas and red sangrias guess how my dining experience went  try ordering tacos from los dos molinos and you will leave pissed order the green chili pork and you will drive miles for it i do hope you give it another chance i have honestly never had anything sub par here in my or so visits and they seriously could charge way more for quality than they do i agree that main ingredient is great also that s why i took the time to write about it but to reiterate  dollar for most dinner items besides new york strip lrb on the list to try rrb is not pricey happy hour has most items for  street tacos are not bursting with meat ask what is the best thing on the menu when you order some place then you can write it off all you want humble pie was more pricey and not worth it all it does is take up parking from a much better place next door for a place with the reference to pizza in it s name you would think it would be better it tasted like peter piper i would love to know what a good chicken taco is in your opinion i cant think of any besides maybe the california tacos at the now closed chuy s but the ones my sister ordered from here were full of chicken and topped with a nice chipotleranch like sauce which is similar
i was in town for the calasu game this past weekend and a few of us bear fans decided to leave sun devil stadium  halftime for a beer break well we never made it back for the second half of the game i m originally from south scottsdale so i know the tempe area pretty well and i know that whatever business is on this corner has always failed it seems like every bar that s been in this space has had more of a loungey feel which does nt really make sense when you re across the street from a football stadium the fact that this place feels like an actual bar is a big plus the place is nt huge and surprisingly was nt all that crowded for a game day lrb apparently it s only been open a couple of weeks rrb there was nt much on tap but the four peaks brew that i was drinking was tasty they also had jaager shots which i downed a couple of honestly i did nt get a good look at the menu lrb food or drink rrb but since this place is still in the process of opening everything is still a work in progess i shared an order of nachos with some friends and they did nt disappoint as far as the crowd goes it s a slightly older group of alums lrb s  s rrb which is probably why our experience was so pleasant lrb rooting for the visiting team in a college town can be an interesting experience as far as dealing with current students rrb our waitress lrb erica rrb was awesome she was attentive and patient which is a major asset when you re working a college bar the excellent level of service may have had something to with the fact that i told her i yelp lrb my tab seemed a bit smaller than it should have been as well rrb but hey either way i had a great time since i do nt live here i obviously wo nt become a regular but i would definitely recommend this place to those hanging out around the asu campus who want an alternative to the mill scene
stopped by petite for brunch on sunday and it was delish i had their take on eggs benedict which was light and fresh and the eggs were perfectly poached my brunch companion had the chicken and mushroom stuffed crepes but we both got plate envy when we saw our neighbor table had ordered the petite maison burger it was huge a two hander and looked very juicy drinks were just as good as the meal they serve french press coffee and fresh squeezed oj my friends and i like to think we are sangria connoisseurs and their french take on red sangria was one of the best i have ever had it was a little pricey at but worth every penny the menu is a bit intimidating if you do nt know french but our server was more than helpful with questions and pronunciations the food did take a little bit of time so make sure you are nt in any real hurry but you wo nt want to be in a hurry if you are on their patio it is darling it s like a little french oasis just yards from scottsdale rd you may want to bring a bird book because the shrubs and flowers attracted types of humming birds during our brief lunch i ca nt wait to go back for dinner to see their pm menu or their late night staff menu but i will make sure to call ahead for a reservation they were nt kidding when they called this place petite the inside has tables and the patio around the same
what an amazing restaurant in old scottsdale chicken that is done on the spit corn bread hot and crisp from the oven and the best coleslaw i have ever eaten service is exceptional what a great place
service may be less than par but the pho is the best evar i have tried all the pho places within miles of my house in tempe az lrb trust me i have a lot of time on my hands rrb my skin tingles with joy when i eat their veggie pho choose wisely
fantastic food great company friendly and relaxing
best chips anywhere great decor prime corner location and no one else has their specialties xlnt
one of my favorite places to be ever so far this is the only legitimate tea shop i have found in the tempemesa area the first time i went here was the first time i tasted real tea i ca nt even touch bags or loose tea sold in grocery stores anymore i came in expecting to be handed a cup of hot water and some tea leaves but i got something quite more a very kind woman brought me a tray with about different devices used to make tea first you pour the hot water into a beaker with the tea leaves then you strain it pour it into another beaker and then finally into your teeny tiny adorable tea cup lrb i swear it makes it taste better rrb resting on its saucer there is an unlimited supply of water so you can drink so long as you have room in your stomach they even leave you a small saucer with little asian treats like candied ginger or rice crackers it has a very relaxed environment which i ve found perfect for catching up with an old friend or studying for school not the rushed starbucks atmosphere the only downside  which is nt really a downside just the reality of a good product  is that it s a little expensive if you re used to the cheap stuff sitting in and drinking a cup of tea is only around but be ready to shell out a lot more to buy some to take home it s worth every penny but be warned that you ll need quite a few of them rrb ps in response to adam k s review all born offers is loose tea lrb which they definitely sell rrb and they have a huge selection of tea accessories  strainers cups kettles tea sets you name it i do nt know which tea room he went to but it was nt this one
best mexican food around if you like spicy the bomberro burrito is a must bomberro sauce has a smokey sweet flavor with an intense burn sensation it compliments the meat and tortilla extraordinarily well
my favorite sushi restaurant by far happy hour is from  and amazing they also have a reverse happy hour late night i ve had really good service at the kierland location so pretty at night great atmosphere to go out and have some drinks and healthy food with friends
love five guys
the team did great no high pressure fixed what need to be repaired and within my budget thanks guys
what s not to love the best beer selection anywhere
low prices good food with good selection reasonably priced and served at all seats reserved seats if you want them good servers who work at staying out of the way clean new and nice but unpretentious but maybe best of all they took out about half the seats in every theater and replaced them with large comfortable seats and snack bar seats with rolling chairs lrb also more comfortable than standard theater seats rrb not a bad seat in the house the kids love it i love it and my pocketbook is happy
chris bianco has made this into a pizza experience you sort of forget it is pizza you will have to wait it s just the way it is the experience begins with chris taking care of you by opening a wine bar right next to his pizza place so you can tie one or on while you wait everyone is treated like a rockstar in this place but if you have a rockstar friend go with you will still have to wait but it makes it more fun while the locals eye you famous people eat here that should be bianco s slogan that and oh yeah it is the best pizza
i loved going to asu go devils
the food is so amazing  we have been times now it is a true spluge lrb caloric rrb  fried chicken really isnt as easy to make as people think and they have it down to a perfection the collard greens are as authenic as you can get i love the waffles as well as the thick syrup my kids are young and i still have to cut their food for them so i want to request a boneless chicken breast just so i can get to my food sooner actually i bet alot of people would like a piece of boneless chicken not me i love the legs and thighs there are lots of people who wont eat meat off the bone lrb weirdo s rrb anyhow try this gem
i stayed at the clarendon from thursday february th to monday february th although my reservations had been made through a large travel firm i was booked by the large firm into an incorrect type of room the staff at the clarendon both the desk clerks and the maids were extremely helpful and friendly they moved me to the room of my choice with no problem the bed was incredibly comfortable and the rooms had comfy and hip furnishings i spent a lot of time by the gorgeous pool lrb love that waterwall rrb and at the rooftop bar the restaurant in the hotel is fabulous i will definitely stay there again but i ll book directly next time since the clarendon will match any online offers
i am not a big wine drinker but total wine is awesome they have the biggest selection and the best prices this place puts bevmo to shame i can spend hours just wandering the store the employees are very helpful and have some great suggestions i am the worst at remembering wines i have had at friends or restaurants even though my descriptions are often sketchy they know exactly what i am talking about they have an area where they do samples of wine champagne or sometimes beer this location is awesome and the employees are always very friendly
wow okay this might be a little winded but follow along my wife and i travel quite a bit and its normal for us to do the red roof inn best western and sometimes motel we bypass the ultra fancy places preferring to spend our budget on resturants okay so we were making plans to travel to scottsdale and decided to check out prices on priceline we were looking in the  price range which in the hot summer gets you a little better than red roof but oh the crappy reviews everywhere so then we run across this jem listed  bucks a night normally even on a budget this price screams run downrun away but the reviews told a different story so believing the reviews we took a chance and booked the room first impression was our call to the front desk to reserve the room donna took our reservation and was so friendly and nice it almost seemed wrong the kinda of friendliness that says hey i am buying a ferrari for cash these guys love me yeah serious that kinda of friendly and it was the same on check in never and in almost any interaction with people who work with the public have we been treated so well andrew also at the front desk actually brought menus to our room after we called to see who delivers in this area the manager truly cares about the travelers who stay here and has made sure her empolyess are the very best in customer service and its a total pleasure the service is so good the place could have been a shit hole and we woulld have been happy yeah its that good but rest assured the place is exceptionally nice most places that we stay if you get a no smoking room all thats seems to mean is recently no smoking the smell of old smoke in the carpets and walls well not here its all new carpet paint beds everything super clean and smells awesome and oh the beds i can not even explain how soft and comfy these bed are no crappy thin pillows either fat and fluffy was a total pleasure how quiet and laid back this place is and i never call anyting perfect but if the shoe fits super close to old town good eats and bars everywhere perfect so honestly due yourself a favor dont be scared by the price tag just pretend its  a night and you will be impressed and best of all its really not
i love this place gang ga ree is yumma dumm dumm
like my wife said lrb and the only other reviewers rrb hey it s dairy queen so tasty and refreshing when it s degrees out thing about dairy queen is they go to an area where there s no other fast food and they dominate i had the pumpkin blizzard which was extremely delightful since we had to wait longer than like minutes they comp d us a medium instead of the mini we ordered my gal got the mint oreo but i did nt try it because i was gluttonizing in my own frosty treat
i have been here a few times since the last review the place is still the same love there lunch specials we got bulgogi  soft tofu soup  bulgogi bowl udon with tempura and yakisoba service was great food was great and would recommend this place for korean food
what can i say that has nt already been said  this place has tremendous food and will not drain your bank account i tend to not be a big salsa fan mainly because of the overly chunky salsa but their salsa is just the consistency for me and tastes great their enchiladas are amongst the best i ve had the thing that gives this place even more of an edge is the service it has to be seen to believed chips and salsa seldom get low before they bring out another bowl of chips or refill your salsa the same can be said for their drink refills there is not a slacker to be found at this place and even if it is packed you can be rest assured you ll be treated with efficiency and speed with an energetic team effort i do nt give out stars easily but this place deserves it not sure how authentic the food is but i like to think i know what good food is and this place has that ps their margaritas may not have top quality ingredients but they are cheap and tasty
you really do nt think about your insurance let alone your insurance agent until you need assistance this is exactly what happened when my son and i were hit head on in se chandler by a driver in a pick up truck going well over mph in a mph zone the police and fire personnel were first on the scene then my state farm agent scott thomas arrived to make sure we were ok and to assist us with what we needed to do next i m thankful that there were no injuries and was very grateful for having scott there to walk us through the insurance claim process in a time when good customer service is hard to come by it is great that chandler has an individual that goes above and beyond to provide great service thank you scott
this is a great mexican food restaurant i eat here for lunch once a week and have never had a bad meal the asada y enchilada is my favorite dish if you are an avocado lover like me this is the place to go i always order extra avocado because they have the best and ripest avocados i have had anywhere
oh breakfast you re my best friend let s be pals forever and for always butterfields offers so many choices it s almost absurd you can choose between breakfast or lunch although for me it s no contest breakfast wins every time the skillet i ordered started with a hash brown base topped with peppers chorizo and avocado then topped with two over easy eggs it originally came with cheese but they left it off for me this comes with your choice of pancakes or grits i picked whole wheat pancakes sooooo good everything was delicious even the fresh squeezed oj and i do nt even really like oranges the service was very friendly and prompt i could seriously eat just about everything on the menu i ca nt wait to go back
i ve been here for brunch lunch dinner and late night drinks this place is what you call cool and sleek for downtown slash midtown phoenix i m not totally loving the loacation south of indian school but you would nt know otherwise while in the restaurant this place is totally modern looking as well as being quite hip inside and has a menu to back it extensive martini list that are only after pm ca nt be a negative in anyone s book also check out the relaxing patio and watch the light railers go by this establishment is a must to partake in at least once if not many times
the short summary  i now officially love flw and the tour i took convinced me to get a membership the next time i go back two friends and i wandered here a few months ago to get our culture on we took the minute guided tour i believe everything was so gorgeous and our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable he was able to not just preach at us with lines he d rehearsed over and over again but tell a story and show how this knowledge applies to life today we were able to take pictures during this tour which does nt happen in a lot of museums these days and i took everything i could until my camera died i left feeling completely inspired and awaiting my next visit
found this place on yelp and glad i did we ordered the rib appetizer which was good but not great the sauces made the dish however for dinner i ordered the peppercorn shrimp and calamari it was incredible i highly recommend it i could nt stop eating it and the portions were so huge i had waddle out of there the waiter was very nice and attentive all in all a great experience go to malee s you ll love it
filet mingnon is to die for with the bacon wrapped filet and smothered with blue cheese and surrounded by marinated whole mushrooms next time i need to try the baby back ribs because i asked to try the bbq sauce that they make in house and loved it also if you want a great burger this place is one of the best i had one the night before and it made me come back to try the filet

well i do nt think i m super cool for liking this place but i guess i am totally down with the hole in the wall places in the hood just playing samantha o rrb really though i think los reyes de la torta is fantastic i went last week for the first time in about a year and i forgot how good it is all i ve had so far is the torta nortena lrb with the steak not chicken rrb and the steak tacos both were incredible especially the torta nortena which has grilled steak onion jalapenos melted cheese chipotle tomato avocado and chipotle mayo it s huge and it s fucking awesome i have nt had a burrito here yet but after seeing what the patrons at the next table had it s on my todo list the burritos were about the size of my forearm and looked delicious los reyes de la torta may be famous for their king torta seen on man vs food but to be honest i d never get that one it has way too many kinds of meat and it s total overkill but hey that s me maybe you ll like it eat this sandwich in under minutes and it s free in case this video has nt been posted already check out the minute clip of man vs food at los reyes de la torta here httpwwwtravelchannelcomvideoasandwichfitforaking

thanks to yelp and lindsey f i was able to attend scottsdale center for the performing arts talk cinema series and watch the thoughtprovoking film melancholia starring kirsten dunst kiefer sutherland and charlotte gainsbourg lrb and an impressive supporting cast as well rrb i will admit that i liked the film even though people around me did nt lrb in fact the more i think about the film the more i m enamored w  the story rrb last night was my first visit to the venue and i m impressed loved the stadium seating  openair feel  and its excellent video and sound systems the lobby was very spacious which i love and seems to be a nice area to relax and socialize while waiting for a showevent to start since i d already eaten before joining up w  other yelpers for this event i do not know if the venue offers refreshments but i m assuming it does since other art theaters do  i will investigate further into the matter on my next visit which i hope will be very soon te vaka or latenite catechism anyone  one complaint leg space is a bit cramped thank goodness the older couple in front of us left lrb about  into the movie rrb because i then could stretch my legs in front of me i m sorry they felt they had to leave but i m grateful for the extra space lol fyi the opening sequences lrb specifically the planet scenes and the music score rrb hailed similarities to terence malick s tree of life which i felt was too indulgent  liked a few scenes but overall did not enjoy the film  perhaps my opinions will change if i give it another chance but truth be told the movie was so long and left me feeling so distanced i doubt i want to spend any more of my time on earth watching it again rrb i think lars von trier the cast and crew did fantastic work on melancholia if you like deep and thoughprovoking films make sure to search for this

standard mexican fare  but quite delicious pitcher of frozen margaritas was yummy too fast and friendly service
great service and happy hour specials love to sit at the bar and the staff is very good
i have hesitated on writing this review because i absolutely  without a doubt  love this place finding the write words and trying to describe their fantastic dishes will lead me to write a book and not a review so i will put it like this quality food caring chefs that enjoy what they do and have a passion excellent flavors trendy but the staff will make you feel at home
a quaint little restaurant serving primarily polish cuisine i tried their chlodnik soup lrb cold beet soup similar to gazpacho rrb and stuffed cabbage lrb golabki rrb both of which were very tasty i was also offered a free sample of their  cream of peanut soup also delicious and shows you that these restaurateurs can get quite creative and beyond traditional polish cooking they have quite the selection of entrees sandwiches desserts and beverages including the polish black currant juice a definite musttry they are only open for dinner on thursdays and fridays and on other days it s just lunch so be aware also it s byob lrb beerwine only rrb there is plenty of free street parking right outside and the staff is very friendly and welcoming will definitely visit again next time i am in the phoenix area
i will drive from long beach just for the red jade chicken it s kickin
i ca nt believe nobody else has reviewed this place it is the place to go for import and craft beers they have an awesome selection and the prices are always fair the best thing is you can mix and match your own six packs
when i first started researching some food options for my trip to arizona cornish pasty company kept popping up at first i tried to ignore it but eventually curiosity got the best of me so many rave reviews about this  glorified hot pocket i m thinking yes i like hot pockets but i do nt know if i could take that affinity to the restaurant level cornish pasty company happened to be literally less than a mile from our hotel so we had to check it out we got there right before the dinner rush and barely waited for a seat at the bar i decided on the chicken tikka masala and the bf got the peppered steak he was intrigued by the bleu cheese we were both happy with our orders there is a decent wait from the time you order but just think of every minute going towards a perfectly baked pasty now i understand how people can compare it to a hot pocket this is the epitome of hot pockets and i ca nt find the words to a description that justifies how good it is our waitress and the kitchen guy we chatted up were both suuuper nice the waitress was very attentive and quick the place itself is pretty dark lrb literally dim lighting rrb and has that euro dive bar feel to it i enjoyed sitting at the bar feeling like a local and watching the kitchen staff work those ovens the food alone would have gotten me to love them to top it off they have three dollar irish car bombs their receipt even says irish car bomb f yeah haha they definitely know what s up no doubt i ll be back for more the next time i m in the area
uh still amazing clearly but tried the mexican burger and it is possibly the best burger i ve ever had order it
we had read some very positive reviews about this place in yahoo travel what a great place to visit the chicken fried steak was huge and delicious outrageous portions a perfect place to hit after a day of spring training baseball
okay i went back to bandera s after realizing that i missed out on the cornbread skillet and boy i am glad i did the cornbread skillet was heavenly sin crunchy creamy so flavorful i am in love my friend and i shared a few different items and everything we had was top notch not sure there is anything at bandera s that is nt good i find it hard to believe that a chain restaurant could have so many great dishes but bandera s has proven me wrong we also ordered the roasted chicken  low country barbecue beef rib combo with coleslaw the chicken is amazingly flavorful the beef ribs were fall off the bone moist and the coleslaw was out of this world can i please have the recipe for the coleslaw  what a great menu not many choices but all of them great
my profile says my last meal on earth chicken and waffles lo lo s is the reason why everytime i visit arizona i make sure i hit this spot up i usually order the  lo lo s meal which comes with pieces of fried chicken with waffles and a scoop of butter with syrup yum this meal would not be complete without ordering their super delicious sweet tea which is served in a glass jar there are two locations one in lower phoenix and the other in scottsdale the one in lower phoenix is the original location however it s much smaller so wait times could vary the scottsdale location is much bigger so dealing with long wait times should not be as big of a problem winner winner chicken dinner lunch and breakfast please
i went yesterday and was very impressed we had an array meets cheese bread oysters and of course really good wine great atmosphere my new favorite hang out
my first experience with five guys was in dc and at the time i wished for a location to open in phoenix wish granted my mom and i visited the new place this week and i was not surprised to see it as busy as it was i had the burger with cheese lettuce tomato pickles jalapeos and bell peppers with cajun fries and mom had the hot dog with bacon and onion with regular fries we could have easily shared one small order of fries and i did nt make it through half of my burger but what i did eat was perfection i was also thrilled to enjoy cherry coke if you re looking for a quiet spot to eat your meal avoid this place it s loud and hectic but that s part of its charm i think the people at the counter were really friendly and smiling which was good to see bonus  a clean restroom i m looking forward to returning to try the hot dog
chip tracy the owner is very knowledgable friendly easy to talk to i had my bmw fixed at his shop they were quick easy to deal with reliable and cost effective great job folks
besides the tasty smoothies which have improved in quality and variety over the years this jamba juice has consistently friendly staff thanks
yogurtland is a chain selfserve frozen yogurt entity the way it works is simple you walk in and grab a cup next you meander along the wall where they have a variety of yogurt flavors and put whatever ones you want into the cup as you continue along the line there are a number of selfserve toppings that you can add into the yogurt then you take the cup to the cashier and have it weighed  the price is based on weight there s a fairly impressive variety of flavors here and most of them were fat free lrb and does nt that mean that it s okay to eat twice as much  rrb they have a number of toppings that range from healthy mango and kiwi to oreo crumbles and gummi bears i actually did nt see the prices marked anywhere but attached is a picture of the cup i made lrb do nt judge i like mm s rrb which was a little over
all i can say is wow i was in fountain hills with family for memorial day and needed a good mexican food joint and senor taco was it and more walked in and was greeted by possibly the owner and immediately felt welcome i had trouble deciding what to order because they have it all decided on the diablo shrimp burrito and it was delicious with all the flavors i was hoping for the others i went with loved their food and of course the margaritas were refreshing in the arizona heat prices are a steal especially for the fountain hills area if your visiting from out of town and unsure where to go this is a no brainer
i can not believe how fast i wanted to get to my pc and write this review i m still a new yelper and have my list of reviews i need to write but this was a priority my dearest friend suggested we do lunch here she had warned me about the neighborhood i m not a snob and have eaten at various questionable locales but i have to admit this made me raise an eyebrow had anyone else recommended it i would have kept on driving it s tucked away in that corner in circle k just pull in the circle k parking lot give it a minute parking will free up trust me it s worth it yes it s tiny about tables that seat about people each very clean you are pleasantly surprised to walk inside you are greeted by chefownerwaiter  he is amazing i did nt catch his name but he s it with a few others in the kitchen  which is at full view he s pleasant and makes you feel like he s known you for years i could nt decide on the menu i have not found any gnocci that is decent at restaruants so when i saw it on the menu it is where i gravitated my mistake was turning the menu around lrb sided rrb because not only did my ca nt decide items on the front i now had more on the back then our kind host offers up specials i left it to chef s suggestion by offering up the gnocci and linguine he suggested the gnocci with choice of sauces and he suggested the pink  which is the vodka sauce oh my goodness the portion was a dinner size portion lrb this was lunch time rrb i pierced one of the gnocci s with my fork and it did nt resist i tested another one and again perfection like stabbing mash potatoes  no resistance then the taste  wow they were like tiny silk pillows in your mouth the vodka sauce had a very meaty flavor for a meatless sauce i was surprised that my plate was completely clean and i did nt even use their incredible bread to mop up the sauce on the plate just the pillows of gnocci service was great by mid meal the place was full and he took care of everyone ensuring ice teas were refilled he even had a delivery  said he d be right back and drove off lrb kitchen help remained  who ensured again ice teas were topped off rrb when we departed we saw him in the kitchen busy so did nt say goodbye but he came out and thanked us while we walked the mini mall parking lot to our car i wish i was in the delivery area  but then again i really do nt need to gain any more weight i ll be back and i sure hope word catches on about this place
amazing burgers the service was fantastic i had a buffalo burger and they ran out of buns so my server lrb i think he was also the manager rrb marshall comped me on the bill for not having buns and he did nt have to do that because i m there for the meat not the bread but that just shows their awesome service i ve been here several times and i will be back cant wait to try the roo burger
had the shwarma chicken gyro with the curry pasta salad it was delicious friendly staff free wifi clean facilityrestrooms good price what more could you ask for if you are the kind of person who puts ranch dressing on everything they eat this probably is nt your place  i m sure you will find a fast food place down the road where your macrib sandwich was mass produced out of a stamp machine
you just ca nt get pizza like this the taste and quality is top notch do nt complain about the wait they got a bar right next door with appetizers and drinks which makes the time fly by like your not even waiting the system they have runs great they take very good care of all of their customers come relaxed and just enjoy the experience this place is easily one of the top pizzerias in the country
awesome
this is my favorite neighborhood thai spot and one of the best thai spots i ve found in the valley having moved from chicago it has been a challenge finding great thai food in az but so happy to have discovered thai dressing  it s delicious i m vegetarian and the staff is always great about making me vegetarian versions of their dishes the vegetarian pad thai with tofu is just amazing lrb they do their pad thai without fish sauce which is hard to find rrb as is the panang curry and the drunken noodles a great way to start the meal are the thai fresh rolls with tofu  crispy veggies and herbs tofu and rice noodles wrapped in fresh rice paper with a delicious dipping sauce my husband is nonveg and says all the chicken dishes are great he also likes his food thai hot and says that they do a great job making it extraspicy if you order it that way portions are quite large  i almost always have plenty to take home for a second meal prices are very reasonable service is always friendly and the servers know all their regulars i highly recommend this place it s a great regular spot for your thai fix
oh my g  tini tuesdays rock i love the loud music and the foods good their brunch on sundays is great too they have drinks specials all the time and i love that
i absolutly love this place i live in chandler go to mcc lrb there is a cheeba hut right across the street rrb but i travel the mins to go to the tempe store the people here are awesome they make you feel like a friend not just a customer everytime i go in the employees introduce themselves let you take as much time as you need and will answer questions without getting impatient they know exactly how to make the perfect sandwich i tell them to make it how they think its good and they are always excellent if you are visiting az you must go they not only offer great eats but an aptmosphere you will never forget
maybe i am biased because a i practically grew up on the ribs in this place and b my grandfather was friends with owner and it reminds me of him lrb since he has now passed away rrb i have always loved the ribs and have been eating them since i could chew solid food i also love that they serve liver pate w  rye bread slices and various crackerbagel chips before the meal the twice baked potato is fabulous and i m not really a potato person i ve never had a bad meal here and like i said i ve had plenty of meals at don and charlie s the meat in general has to be good lrb i usually stick to the ribs rrb my grandfather had a cattle ranch and my father owned a steak house lrb award winning ribs by the way rrb so if they like it i m sure it will please most people this is a valley establishment nothing trendy about it just a big friendly restaurant good food and lots of memorabilia in a nice atmosphere of dark wood and crisp white linens quick tip i would suggest a reservation and they have a private lot that i believe is valet only or mostly valet  so if you do nt have any cash on hand you might have to park on the side of the street or in a near by lot
sorry matthew k  it s official  the place now reeks of fish i ve however never had an aversion to pungent seafood aromas so it s all good with me i ve always had a thing for grocery stores the aisles and aisles of food shiny jars of canned goods fresh produce boxes of sugary cereals frozen delicacies do nt know why but it intrigues me and it does nt get any better than lee lee oriental supermarket i especially love exotic ingredients  who knew there was so many varieties of bok choy  curry pastes chili sauces oodles of noodles tofu rice  it s all here everything you need  more to make a wonderful asian inspired meal i could spend a lifetime shopping at this store and i do nt think i would be able to sample even half of their items but best of all is the large fish market  it is a vision of many kinds of fresh fish shellfish and other seafood at unbeatable prices i am eager to cook savory asian dishes at home now i all i need is to find a really good cookbook and buy a wok
my husband and i stayed at royal palms next store and we decided to try the steakhouse at the phoenician the dining area was full but we were able to eat at the bar area the place was hip our waitress sheena was so cool it was late already but we were starving and wanted dinner so we tried the tasting menu it was excellent for per person it was worth every penny of it and more every dish was so yummy especially the chilean sea bass in yusu broth  we practically licked the plate the petite filet was cooked to perfection we got to sample different steak sauces even though the steak itself was well seasoned and sheena s service just made the whole dining experience great she was helpful and fun to talk to the next day we had our new year s eve dinner at t cook s at royal palms we paid double lrb or was it tripled  rrb the price for just soso food at t cook s at jg we had better food more reasonable prices more hip environment and crowd and excellent customer service hope we ll get to go back again in the near future
i live in chandler and will follow dr pottgen anywhere and everywhere she goes if you want a great doctor go see her
i love this place they have amazing chicken parm and i love the bread they served with olive oil and vinegar not to pricey but a good restaurant i come here often with my family love the small family restaurant you have to try this place
amazing amazing amazing i knew i would love it the second i walked in because the entire atmosphere of this establishment screams my owners and employees take care of me and care a lot about quality the staff was friendly and patient with me while i spent about minutes deciding what to order for take out lrb everything i mean everything looked tasty rrb while this place is nt cheap i did nt regret a single penny because the portion sizes were generous and i knew that what i was putting into my mouth had been thoughtfully prepared and was healthy and filling i can not rave about this place enough check it out
busy location leave yourself extra time if your gonna come in here for business clean location and friendly staff
fresh handpulled noodles not only can you watch the chef create and pull your noodles a minute after you order your dish but once he s done it takes about minutes for them to reach your table i ordered the thick fried noodle w  vegetables and my husband ordered the same but with the wide noodles the noodles have a great texture that i could best describe as being slightly firm with some pleasant chewiness the sauce was well seasoned light and flavorful the restaurant is clean and bright the prices are very reasonable the servings are huge the staff are fast and friendly and most importantly  it s a short drive from our house this was our st visit and we re already big fans we ll definitely be back
treats we tried the cookies lrb chocolate chip and chocolate truffle rrb and would have to give them stars delicious breakfast seems like they changed the recipe for the turkey maple sausage so it now has an odd herb flavor and less maple flavor but tried the flattened meatball and liked it so might switch to that option  if you go be sure to check out the bathrooms each one was decorated uniquely by a staff member and the sinks are shared by both genders you also get to see how very clean kitchen the kitchen is as you walk to the bathrooms so that is a great bonus overall a great nonchain place for unique and delicious food
everyone knows that tony soprano did nt die hbo merely made the ending ambiguous so that america would be shielded from the awful truth that he was planning to move away from the east coast to none other than scottsdale arizona why you ask  because where else can you carry on business dealings in a strip joint be involved in waste management act out of control all the time philander defraud the government and fit right in  but for he and many other recent transplants from jersey the truth is part of scottsdale s allure rests with places like defalco s italian grocery sitting in a worn strip mall in an older section of town the scene almost evokes a little hint of the garden state however the good news is that i ve never seen anyone whacked in the spacious parking lot or wearing a members only jacket for that matter upon entering there s a claustrophobic sensation as you see the grocery aisles creating a slightly labyrinthine path to the deli counters which are separate based on ordering prepared or raw food upon reaching the prepared food aisle you ll invariably see a microcosm of scottsdale ranging from senior citizens to high schools girls using platinum cards to buy lunch for the whole family lrb luckily though no sign of carmine gotti just yet rrb the menu  it s a pageant of sumptuous meats and cheeses and they even offer italian soda to go with it s so good you might think like many a famous eatery it s a front for the local outfit while i do nt believe that to be true lrb it is arizona after all rrb the owners certainly make purists and old school italian food fans happy with its inclusion of more traditional meat choices like capacollo the food also will seem dry but that s only because they are careful not to drown out the meat s character with too much mayo or other condiments some may not like it pricewise this place is pretty much a steal it s a shade more expensive than subway but not much moreso but as scottsdale goes it s almost unbeatable they also accept plastic and have a loyalty card so as you can imagine you ll want to come back often if you know what is good for you since it s a deli there s no waitstaff still service is total class people are friendly and professional so that it still feels familyowned and not corporate the tables are usually clean in the seating area and spaced evenly enough that you wo nt feel like someone just broke your legs but then there is the one detraction to this place the supposedly endless wait for your order i ve never been on a weekday but weekends i have found are pretty manageable for some people it wo nt be like jackinthebox but if you order ahead you should avoid some of the hassle of course part of the allure going to an italian restaurant in the cultural attitude about savoring life food and a slower pace than our anglosaxon roots ultimately prefer unless that is you have reservations to buca di beppo but that s another story entirely
i went here and i was impressed i am mostly from md and there are alot of texmex restaurants there but prickly pear had my heart and i miss it i wish they would put one in md the salsa is hot and tortillas are really really good we got fajitas and everything was fresh midwestern state and california do have the best mexican food
simply the best restaurant in the greater phoenix area the foie gras was top notch and while i have had foie gras many places chef binkley just makes the best foie gras i am not sure if it is product technique or a combination but this foie gras is something special everything i have ordered here was excellent my wife has tried some things that do nt hit perfectly with my palate but she loves them lrb like tuna with wasabi ingredients are always fresh and the amuses just keep coming the only thing i was sad about was the people at the table next to us were getting different amuses and theirs sounded better lrb foie gras empanadas anyone  rrb i have heard plenty of people complain that there are too many small bites throughout the meal but those people are silly nothing like jerkoff rich people to say stop giving me things for free i hate free things if you do nt want it do nt eat it simple as that people scoff at the prices but i think it is well worth it if you are going weekly then yes this can get expensive but if you save up for special occasions then this is well worth it i wo nt go through everything i had but i will tell you that everything was great lrb on the winter menu rrb by the end of the night you will be rolling out of there so bring a big appetite last time i got the wine pairing with a course meal but i do nt think i will do that again it was actually too much wine next time i will opt for a cocktail or two so i do nt have too much of a buzz and i can remember the dessert courses better
got this tip from the concierge at the biltmore he knew we wanted some flavorful local cuisine he said it was of utmost importance to ask for the richarson s menu that this had the taste profile we were seeking well the restaurant has adapted to this twomenu thing by just printing on both sides of the menu which was very convenient i ordered the plate combo of red and green pork chili and it was absolutely delicious the sauces were rich but not too thick a fantastic consistency lrb i love sauce science rrb the meat was tender tender tender rice and beans were wonderful additions the other plate was a chili pasta with smokey chicken in a cream sauce and seriously why do nt more people make this kind of pasta  the pasta itself is chiliflavored just like you ve had spinach pasta or squid ink pasta i need to find a recipe to make this could be a real hit in many more restaurants than just this one we ordered a stuffed chili pepper and this is essentially a twice baked potato just served in a light green chili pepper lrb sadly i do nt remember what kind of a pepper more firm than a poblano smaller than a poblano rrb i did attach a picture to help you understand i would definitely go here again service was soso but i think that s cuz we went a bit later this town tends to close early

my favorite pizza in arizona almost as good as my favorite place in seattle cool ambiance great food just an interesting place to be i m also a sucker for old restored buildings they make an amazing white mushroom truffle oil pizza  and i hate mushrooms eat here
first off this place is topnotch i would give stars if i could allow me to explain there are a few things that separate jolta java from the rest the ambiance and aesthetics of this place are cozy calming and welcoming there is a mini tv room with bookshelves of books you may check out for up to weeks comfortable chairs and tables invite you to grab a cup of joe and nestle in the menu is extensive sandwiches coffees smoothies scones muffins etc etc i love their smoked salmon blt it is wonderful and unrivaled compared to most coffee shop food the people that work there are chill too there is an awesome sign draped over the cash register with a woman talking on her cellphone and says we will not serve you while you are on your phone good for you jolta java get those annoying people to separate the phone from their ear as a courtesy to the rest of us now here are the little things that i noticed that makes this place stand at the top the sandwiches are wrapped in heavy duty paper not that thin flimsy wrap that other places have love the fruit cup side that is offered they keep your info so that every th drink you order is free talk about investing in your customers and community i am a huge fan and will continue to take my business to this fine establishment
w has done it again the aloft chain is just what you would expect from them just slightly simplified the room was ultra clean bed was great and the eclectic style throughout was well done i would and will do it over again
favorite mexican restaurant in az great atmosphere laid back great prices and great happy hour deals in the cantina every time i come to phoenix my friend and i always schedule a night out at chevy s even with the loss of a location we still go out of our way to make time to eat there candace or caitlin are the best waitresses there friendly quick and they even get my order right every time
i do nt know how many leatherbound books he has or whether or not his apartment smells of rich mahogany but head baker jeff yankellow is kind of a big deal in he was part of a team that won the coupe du monde so he s literally been a world champion at baking you d think with that kind of cache you d find him working at some ridiculously upscale restaurant or in an overly pretentious bakery in the middle of an overly pretentious area nope the simply bread bakery is a nondescript warehouse with a small house in front to serve as the shop located on th st north of mcdowell but trust me if this is out of the way for you make the trip jeff and his staff make some of the most ridiculously good baked things you will ever have the baguette is his specialty but the bakery also served dozens of varieties of bread jams jellies cookies rolls etc even just the standard white bread you d make your pb  j on is awesome i overbought the last time i went in and spent the next days finding things to do with bread because i d run out of freezer space i ca nt deduct a star for it being pricey you get what you pay for and at this place you get the best possible ingredients prepared by those who are actually passionate about making bread this is one of the true hidden gems of phoenix
my first experience with boba left me unsure but now i am a diehard fan it is a great experience of texture and flavor and something you have to try to understand explaining it just sounds weird this place is quaint and friendly with a great variety of drinks and interesting appetizers both meat and vegetarian they have something for everyone even if you are not adventurous enough to try the boba there are tables and soft comfy couches to hang out and wait or enjoy whatever you order
this place is awesome the traditional restaurant as well as the deli style restaurant inside the assortment of food items is amazing too many good things to choose from and the prices are great it is a great experience if you like mexican food you must go and check it out this is the closest thing to mexico without being there after eating it is great to explore the rich colors and products in the market and do nt forget the sunday brunch with tons of choices and lots of traditional entertainment
i have been to drybar a handful of times over the last few months and am totally hooked i have a very thick wavy hair and to have someone else wash and style it is such a treat each time i have been to drybar the salon is running on time and each stylist i have had has been as wonderful as the next great atmosphere comfortable pampering and to come out looking amazing each time  ca nt be beat everyone deserves to treat themselves to this very reasonable indulgence

leah the trainer at dog house training academy is great she s friendly knowledgable and makes herself available via email or phone should you have any questions her knowledge on dogs is extensive and even though you re just paying for the class she ll gladly offer up advice on any issues you may be having with your dog the classes seemed simple enough to me but there was a client in my class that just was nt picking it up at all and blatantly disregarding her techniques i was impressed with how leah handled the situation and the customer she s very thorough and always explains why she does things the way she does and why it works so there are no questions and it s always made perfect sense to me with the quality of service and the knowledge that you get to tap into while you re training with leah you just ca nt find a better deal out there her rates are competitive and she offers referral discounts too
i love me some dobson ranch as far as municipals in the valley are concerned this is as good as it gets lrb aguila is a close second rrb no overbearing marshalls rates that top out at in the winter above average range and practice area including two large putting greens cheap pitchers of beer a longtime cart lady who will spray your face with water in the summer as far as the course itself this is not typical az golf  there are no cacti only treelined fairways and some water sprinkled throughout to pose as threats but there are birdies to be had and lots of them   and are the best chances in my experience lrb i consider this my home course rrb the greens are usually pretty moderate speed to slow  this is grainy bermuda not some hybrid or bent grass so prepare to run the putts into the back of the hole  is my favorite hole a shortpar that gives you the chance to hit over a tree left and drive the narrow fairway leaving you a long to midiron into an elevated green that slopes toward you  is a formidable challenge if you have the tendency to block lrb or slice as may be the case rrb the ball from timetotime as your ball will face a watery grave  is a tricky treelined hole with a tight driving area and doglegs right and finally  a short par that is easily reachable and where a par feels like a bogey a scant yds from the blue tees lrb but rarely plays it s full length rrb there are some low scores out there a great course value practice area and recently renovated restaurant and bar  stars

thank you local place with good food and good service much appreciated
i m lovin me some chez nous decided to throw caution to the wind and meet a fellow yelper alas bonnie g got lost along the way so i had time to survey the scene with the help of three gin  tonics and two really friendly cute bartenderesses lrb i like making up new words rrb music was strictly soul  old school rb which fit the mood perfectly this place is dark but in a groovesque and inviting manner lrb if barry white was a bar he d be chez nous rrb crowd is one of the more diverse i ve seen yet in phoenix and if tv s your thing they ve got one at the far end of the bar playing grey s anatomy on thursday nights but as i ve never seen that show before i was nt going to start now in this here cool bar of all places around the time bonnie g arrived a live band had started playing classic rb and funk they were kickass as were the folks jivin on the dance carpet we sat there at the bar shootin the shit and enjoying the music for a few more rounds of drinks like shady s i m pissed that i ve driven by this place countless times on my way to and from work and never thought once of going in but now i know better which means chez nous is going to be frequented by yours truly loads of times moving forward word to the noo

i think this is a very good yogurt shop and maybe i m just easy to please in this department  i came in late one night as they were closing and sheepishly asked if i could sneak in for a fix  the lady was very nice and said of course 
i totally agree with stevey p  the best thing about heritage square is that it preserves the past while still celebrating modern culture yes you can see beautifullyrestored victorian homes and imagine how things used to be but you can also have some of the country s best pizza at pizzeria bianco down a pint at rose  crown or take part in celebrations of different cultures and social groups we walked around here for the first time this past friday when it was deathly hot out but i look forward to cooler weather when my husband and i can come here and sit one of of the gorgeous shaded benches and just take in the scene
what a fun place the staff is absolutely incredible and anticipated my every need before i even knew i had it wonderfully accommodating fun funky and kitschy  i just loved all of the attention to detail i stayed in the chaparral gardenview patio suite which has a huge furnished patio with loungers and a walkway to the pool area lots of space in the room and even a separate living room area for entertaining friends distrito  great food lrb try the queso fundido with duck barbacoa rrb old town whiskey  great selection lrb try the commodore rrb pool  great dj s and vibe on weekends lrb get a cabana rrb
my sister heard about this place and took me while i was at home visiting the place is decorated minimally but i think that might be part of its charm the lab flasks with coffee beans on the table is a cute little detail we noticed the staff were helpful and friendly and even chatted a bit when we instigated conversation the menu was a bit scarce but nonetheless i ordered a breakfast burrito and my sister got the veggie lrb and added chicken rrb i did nt try hers but mine was amazing i m huge on mexican food and breakfast burritos lrb i mean what native phoenixian is nt  rrb and i loved how light and fluffy the crepe was in comparison to the tough tortilla the avocado sauce and touch of chipotle pepper was the perfect balance of light and spicy we were also greeted with freshly made granola as an appetizer on the house which was absolutely delicious i had a chai tea which was yummy and i quite liked how they did nt carry any name brand soda products and of course free wifi is always a plus love this little bar ca nt wait to come back and i m back in town
what a great find i ve been searching for years for a place like this sketchy from the outside but worth the wait and that you will do ordered chicken tikka marsala lrb on spice scale could have gone to an rrb and the lamb vindaloo lrb also a more fairly spiced rrb with the garlic naan oh la la that hit the spot the restaurant is dim and loud from nearby tables but cute and comfy we will be back and i m not sure i would even waiver from my original selection it was that delicious feel safe with this selection on flavor and atmosphere but step out of the box for more flavor with the spices
i love the gfm they have some of the best vendors the vendors there are not pushy and many offer samples i have nt been here in the fall months but i ve heard there are many more vendors than the summer the location has great parking is nice and open and next to a little sittingplay area for kids it is my saturday morning ritual to head there
this was a great experience i highly recommend having your server explain how they designed the menu to order our server brandon was very helpful he knew his menu and was super prompt he received a  tip due to his service the food is yummy i had their kobe burger po  boi and beef burger all oz sliders i also had the sweet potato fries which were very tasty my wife ordered the kobe lamb and grilled cheese all oz she loved it we both brought home one full oz burger each and half the order of fries and tots they do not skimp on portions the restaurant was very clean and inviting parking can be an issue as its in the heart of old town however that s any where now and days we also shared a pizzookie this was small and about oz or so however after the mean we had it was perfect this is going to be a frequent for us moving forward as their selection of stax are pretty enticing  side note  if you love exotic meats stax offers a selection of exotic burgers today was pheasent
when i lived in phoenix i was a regular at fez my friends and i probably averaged twice a week and there were likely weeks when we were there more the atmosphere is really wonderful a rarity in phoenix the food is very consistent and almost everything on the menu is unique and flavorful i must agree with some of the other reviews that the waitstaff is very hitormiss i ve had wonderful service and terrible service and there are times when i ve had to go and ask the bartender to send someone over to our table to take our order as regulars in particular i would nt think that this would be something we would have to deal with that being said there was one time when they were understaffed and the manager was very apologetic and even sent us a bunch of appetizers free of charge as an apology so i have nt personally experienced the attitude that others report i miss fez now i live in san diego when i go to visit it s always on the itinerary every time usually as soon as i land
oh arriba how i miss thee we just moved from az to mn and what we ca nt find good mexican lrb or new mexican as some of arriba s dishes are rrb my absolute favorite dish is the rio grande enchiladas  the spicy meat the cheese  mmmm we recently went to the arriba in tempe lrb or awatukee  rrb and the service was awful but our typical arriba is phoenix and the service is good
i love this park it s fantastic built on a landfill it was designed wonderfully by the city of chandler giving great views of the city to anyone who visits the park seems to be separated into four areas  dog parks kid park disc golf and archery range there is a walkingjogging trail around the park as well the only part of the park that i have personally used is the dog parks they have separate dog areas which are opened on a rotating basis so the ground does nt get overrun with all the fourlegged friends the dog areas have water fountains lrb both human and dog sized rrb benches for the humans to sit and pooper scoopers to clean up after your pooch this is by far the cleanest dog park i ve been to in the east valley  the dog owners have been more or less responsible lrb more than at other dog parks rrb and i ve seen city workers in the dog areas several times my dog loves it we ve also taken a stroll around the park and seen the kids play areas it looks like most of the equipment is made out of recycled materials  old tires old construction equipment and all done in a safe manner the kids we saw looked like they were having a great time
the service the hospitality the atmosphere and the food amazing
fuego has a killer happy hour mojitos with freshly muddled mint and great food try barbacoa tacos that are braised in dr pepper and ask for a side of corn along with your beans and rice topping it off their wait staff is pretty great
i love the family meal here good deal dollar entrees
why did i wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot having a father who grew up on los olivos i remained a loyal customer that is until last evening s change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of los sombreros authentic mexican cafe  cantina i am not an expert on authentic mexican cuisine nor will i pretend to know what the flavors of san miguel de allende taste like  however i am a foodie so i know good food when i eat it we chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another cardinal s loss lrb sad i know since they were off to a great start rrb lucky for us it was a calm monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter aka the bartender phil lrb no need to blush if you read this rrb did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey my friend allowed phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while i allowed phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar no salt heavy on the tequila preferences and that was just to start perfectly crafted margaritas in hand check now what to eat for dinner my friend ordered his beloved mole poblano lrb rrb while i could nt decide between the smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema lrb yumm rrb and the pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce  or  tinga poblana sauce lrb rrb i opted for the pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and once again my dinner friend had  order envy that s not to say his mole was par lrb or dare i say subpar rrb because it was nt  it actually has received many culinary awards being named best mole both locally and nationally but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach perfectly sauted chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla is amazzzzzzing it s also fair that i note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides lrb as we ordered rrb they also offer up tacos lrb at rrb various quesadillas lrb  rrb and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole salads and more deciding i d save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth i boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert undecided again and so we trusted our gastronomy guide phil to choose he selected the mexican chocolate cream pie to finish off the evening and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as i always like to do thank you phil and los sombreros for the memorable dining experience the food was outstanding margaritas made by phil are the best and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for hh or even a late night dessert thank you for staying in the neighborhood azucena tovar and congrats on almost turning years old
went here saturday night on a first date we decided to eat at the bar and one of the owners was serving drinking and was very friends and helped me find just the right beer for my mood i tried the duck and carrot cake which were fantastic the menu is unique in the best way possible and their beerwinespirits list is perfect for my tastes i even made the point of creating a yelp so i could help this new family business out just saying
the only thing i miss about living in phoenix is that i can no longer frequent caffe boa you just ca nt go wrong here the food is outstanding do nt let the strip mall fool you this place is a gem
this is the place for a fabulos breakfast i have friends who visit from texas and they wait all year to eat the eggs benedict here they are the best i personally love the pancakes smothered in bannanas pecans and hot syrup yummmmy they also serve some very healthy and delicious salds for lunch like the strawberry spinach salad and the sandwhiches ar e very good their is often a wait for breakfast but it moves fast and their is a community table which sometimes shortens the wait

this is where i fell in love with carne asada burrtios when i moved from chicago to phoenix i had no idea what mexican food could be this was the first place i had tried because it was within walking distance to home  school i must have eaten here twice a day for an entire semester today it s more of an afterthebar treat this is the benchmark for all burritos you may feel the need to high five someone after eating one i can only relate in analogy it is garfield s lasagna bert s oatmeal laestragonian s acheans olympian ambrosia and elvis s peanut butter and banana freakin sandwiches all wrapped into a burrito

coal fired pizza pizza that is coal fired is simply amazing unfortunately air pollution laws in california prevent restaurants in california from having coal fired ovens the coal makes a total difference a nice thin crust that this crispy sauce is great i recommend that you add fresh basil to your pizza toppings are tasty and plenty i know this is a chain but i had to review it
froyo is froyo is froyo right  not at this place someone lovingly crafted the perfect midcentury modern cafecoffee shop for this central phoenix neighborhood lrb think lux pane bianco postino windsor rrb and then decided to go avant garde and offer frozen yogurt instead of that cafe farecoffee and pastries that you would expect for such a beautifully crafted space i actually wanted to hang out here i do nt think i ve ever said that about a froyo shop the frozen yogurt itself was what you d expect from any paybytheounce froyo shop but twirl gets some extra points for inventiveness in toppings  in addition to the standards twirl offers gourmet toppings like pumpkin pie spice raspberry sauce glazed pecans and huge chunks of candy perfect perfect perfect

went early during first friday last week and scored a spot at the bar thank god for that because this place was tiny and i would nt recommend it for groups having said that we ordered whatever the bartender suggested lrb different drinks in all rrb and found them all to be outstanding we would ve liked to try some of their rums but there was no help offered figuring out how to sample those  it s a bit overwhelming the nice thing is that you can order food from the adjoining restaurant however the jerk spice on the perfectly cooked scallops was so spicy that i could not eat it
this place is mackin friendly service with authentic food we had the chicken wings as an app which tasted good but nothing to write home about i had the italian flag lasagna which took about minutes but was definitely worth the wait some of the best i have had in a longtime this dish was made from scratch you can taste the difference with fresh backed pasta good sauce and lots of meat my wife had the grilled italian sausage sandwich you can tell the sausage was made in house with great spices and a little bit of heat we will definitely go back
my mom sister and i spent a few days in scottsdale last week lon s was wonderful the service was excellent and the food was great ask to see the wine cellar it s amazing
i ve been to this place a couple times i ve always sat at the bar to get food the bartenders have been extremely friendly each time and the service has been great the has come out very quickly each time the burgers are amazing and there other things that i have had are all unique with tons of flavor it s reasonably priced and the crowd seems very relaxed each time we ve gone we ve ended up talking to other people at the bar and they have always been very friendly usually when that happens you get stuck in a conversation with so weirdo but that was nt the case at all you can tell the staff has fun at work which makes for a fun atmosphere they re quick to make suggestions or tell you when you ve made a good choice this place is a little bit out of my way but i will definitely be going back to visit many times in the future
i d been craving some legit deli food i m snobby about sandwiches i grew up in pa and spent much of my free time eating and hanging out in manhattan and philadelphia two cities full of prime delis i had high expectations walking into miracle mile it just emits a vibe of deliciousness and authenticity my friend jen recommended this place and she ordered a reuben that looked amazing even to my vegetarian gaze i ordered a ny veggie sandwich on a fresh roll good god y all that sandwich took me to heaven for a moment best of all lrb are you ready for this  rrb i substituted my french fries for a  real  fresh potato pancake for an extra cents it was soo soo good i kinda came close to crying into it you see it s outdoor bazaar season in pennsylvania meaning potato pancakes are being cooked every weekend in every polish church parking lot for miles around i ve found a cure for my pa summertime homesickness miracle mile deli
thai basil has an cozy indoor dining area and a modest outdoor dining area the place was beautifui neat and clean i found the inside of the restaurant a bit over done with their ornaments especially with the small statues all placed around their bar near the cash register but the picture frames with the elephants and buddhas were tastefully placed around the dining tables the bamboo blinds were a very good addition to the ambiance i especially liked the color of the tables and chairs a kind of warm brown the dishes took long to arrive but probably because there were a lot of us who were ordering the waitress did her job well and was very informative on what dishes we should try next the refill of our glasses were very prompt and even early my glass was only threefourths full and she would come and refill it right away the waitress was always smiling and in good spirits great service we ordered dishes  spicy noodles chow mien thai basil and silver noodles they were all pretty good and tasty i liked the spicy noodles the best it had a light savory sauce and the saltiness was just right the silver noodles with black bean sauce was a bit salty for me but it was delicious all the same thai basil was served with rice it was also good but i m not very fond of anise flavor we had the thai basil in mild and we later found out it was better if it were a lot more spicier the chow mien was delightful it was my second favorite among the four it had a thick spicy sauce and crunchy vegetables all the dishes with their noodles and vegetables were cooked just right and their noodles were a bit chewy at first but when it cooled down a bit it was soft and yummy i like mine chewy though  rrb every thing really smelled good it was a great dining experience i loved the hospitality mints they were soft and melted in your mouth
we use our bikes every day i commute to work on a bike and my son rides his bike to school so when my son s bike got stolen i took the morning off and went to the trailhead bike shop and cafe the shop is less than a mile from our house and i was looking forward to using a shop so close to us the owner kiel listened to what i was looking for and made appropriate recommendations the bike i wanted for my son had to be ordered and he gave my son a rental on the house so he would not be without a bike unfortunately my son s new bike was recently stolen too we re hoping it turns up but will likely be replacing it at the bike cafe i also bought a road bike to go along with my commuter bike kiel worked to get me the best deal on the type of bike i wanted the staff is great and the food is good too
gosh green is just the best i was nt even vegetarian when i first started coming here much less vegan i did nt even know it was vegan until a few trips in i m about  vegan now but it does nt even matter good food is good food my favorite thing to get is the original g poboy with sweet potato tots but always always check their specials and the soynamis eat them eat all of the soynamis
all around great burger place with a martini twist i ve been here many times and have to say it s a great place to drink and meet new people i highly recommend the common table in the middle of the place service was great and the atmosphere is cool and hip sweet potato fries enough said
this place is a great restaurant for one of those beautiful phoenix afternoonsevenings the outside patio is very comfortable to eat and the view is great we ve gotten several different plates and there s nothing we have nt liked the service is amazing one time we asked for a spicy dish and the waitress asked if it was spicy enough and my husband said no but it tasted great anyway and the chef himself came out to apologize and told us that next time he d make it really spicy who does that anymore  we really appreciated the gesture
my favorite mexican restaurant in the whole state of arizona thus far fernando lrb the owner rrb knows exactly what i want when i come in and wastes no time in preparing my meal i recommend the fried steak or the pork ribs in tomatillo sauce this place has the best hortchata i have ever tried in my life lrb they also sell it to you by the gallon to take home rrb doo itt
i do nt know how anyone could say anything bad about this place like someone else said it s not that hard to make an appointment lrb all businesses deserve that respect rrb secondly check your attitude when you walk in the door and stop writing negative reviews when you are actually the problem when i first picked my dress and veil it was at the old location i had absolutely no issues when they moved a few miles to a much better store that was just the start of how great they are emma lrb the one in charge of alterations rrb nearly redid my entire dress i wanted something that no one else had so i picked a dress that she spent months on altering for me she was able to take my dress from a size  to a size she changed the neckline to sweetheart and added a corset into the dress she also fixed a few rips and had to redo the beading on the majority of the dress in order to get the symmetry right after taking it in so much not only that but when my family came in from out of town for the wedding my cousin needed a quick alteration with only one day to work on a pair of his pants she did nt hesitate to help out mind you my wedding was at the end of october and one of the busiest times for them but she was able to do the alterations for my mom motherinlaw myself and my cousin emma was nt the only one that helped out only days before the wedding i asked a huge favor of louise a couple of days before the wedding and requested a custom head piece for my reception since i could nt find anything in stores that i loved she spent the entire day before my wedding creating it for me and even met me outside of store hours to deliver it let s recap a custom dress a cathedral veil a custom head piece alterations for family members and the most incredible staff on the planet tell me again why you had a problem here  i love this team and am forever grateful for them making my wedding perfect
good place to stay we have stayed there every year for the last five years lrb that should say it all rrb the people are great and very welcoming the price is right and the location is great access to hiway mall and plenty of places to eat
a superb location  gorgeous and intriguing openlayout facility  stateoftheart technology  a great dr berschler lrb from jersey daughter s  asu  he lives in downtown too rrb  a friendly staff  lots of insurance options  my new dentist
 i had such a pleasant visit to the dentist are rarely words you will hear but let me tell you i certainly did first off ligia was so friendly at the front desk and bent over backwards to make sure my insurance was all in line well it was nt so instead she hooked me up with an awesome coupon and made sure my cleaning was as cheap as possible what a doll as for megan well let s just say i was thisclose to asking for her number  i genuinely think we would be great friends however i am certain she is that friendly and personable with all her costumers last but not least the doc he was great he cracked jokes taught me a little somethin somethin about tooth decay and knew my uncle from when he played for the suns in the s good memory dr i was blown away by my visit this crew is the best and i proudly sport their magnet on my fridge
loved the wings and pizza nice people nice clean place we will eat there again
after hearing and reading about how wonderful restaurant is i finally put my foot down and said we re going there best move i ve made in a long time i had catfish  i forgot to order cajun catfish durn my hide my mrs had catfishshrimp and my year old ordered meat loaf they were out of meat loaf but she was pretty happy with the chopped bbq beef sandwich the women split a peach cobbler dessert and neither spoke for minutes i ve got to get the full pan  it d be worth the not many tables filled but kitchen was still quite busy with to go orders service was still fine the waitress daughter of owner was fantastic and running the front quite well i could tell she had her hands full but still working her tush off to keep up with preps and keep new arrivals happy and orders going to tables great place ca nt wait to get back extensive menu so i ll be able to go many times with different experiences dave k
me gusta comida de cubano i came here with a friend and we used a groupon i have heard a lot of great things from coworkers and friends about this small little place in arcadia phoenix area i have driven by it several times and it was finally time to get a feel of cuba the waiter gave us a very homey and family type feeling with the passion he showed by explaining the menu i ordered the pollo cubano which has grilled chicken with savory sweet onions on top and a side of black beans and rice the onions gave a dynamic sweetness and yumminess that i ca nt explain with words my friend ordered dried plantains the first order had black beans inside and the other was almost like a sweet plantain banana dessert we enjoyed the food family style with some beer i will definitely have to make a return trip to havana cafe
i love love love this quaint bustling sandwich shop which is located in the strip mall with the starbucks off hardy and university the sandwiches have artsy names such as the mona jazz picasso van gogh or art deco i ve tried several of the sandwiches but the best is the sack s symphony lrb turkey breast bacon avocado tomato alfalfa sprouts cream cheese and mayo on grain bread rrb every sandwich comes in a cute boxed lunch with a cookie
love everything on the menu you just ca nt go wrong here the atmosphere is fun and the food is to die for
tl  dr amazing mediterranean food with plenty of meat options that will blow your mind you ve never had meat like this before i m really confused as to how i do nt have a review for this place already after living in tempephoenix for over years i remember craving gyros from haji baba even as a kid in fact i would venture to say haji baba and baiz market are the oldest quality middle eastern shops in the valley apparently my friend has never been here before and i decided i would be a terrible friend if i never took him of course he had trouble finding it because he thought it was a restaurant restaurant and not a holeinthewall type place we were seated even though it was lunch did nt take more than minutes for our gyro plates to come out which were piled high with succulent gyro meat to perfectly complement the star of the dish there was white rice and a salad with plenty of unique dressing gyro meat by itself is usually amazing simply because its meat but when its accompanied with an amazing sauce it really becomes stellar the white sauce or what i think is an iteration of tsaziki sauce is perfect for the juicy ground lamb meat if you have nt had gyro before and you want to give a try i would definitely get the gyro plate at haji baba i almost forgot to mention that you ca nt leave haji baba without trying their baklava take your pick at which nuts you want pistachio almonds walnuts mixed etc aside from their restaurant food my family usually buys groceries from here one of our staples is pita bread and you can usually get a box of pita bread for like freeze some of it and use the rest as you wish it goes perfectly with store bought hummus and foul lrb fava beans rrb
great food and service country food at its best
mouth watering that s all i have to say the food at this place is seriously amazing everything we tasted was better than the dish before it and we had a fabulous bottle of white wine to accompany our meal the scallops were a highlight as was the potato pie dish lrb that s not a very technical name for what it was but that s my best effort rrb it was all very very good and the only thing keeping us from returning is the cost we genuinely enjoyed our evening here and we will absolutely go back but it is pricey especially for the size of the dishes the atmosphere and ambiance are so fun and this place is a little dressier and trendier than some other places we ve been in scottsdale i highly recommend this for a night out with friends or a cool date night it seemed as though reservations would be a good idea although we did nt have them and were okay lrb it was busy though rrb
i just returned from my first visit to north kenilworth and i ve already told my husband that we ve found our new family vet excellent service lrb they were able to get me in for a sameday appointment rrb great staff lrb everyone had a friendly smile for me and my dog rrb knowledgeable doctor lrb dr holmes diagnosed the issue and took the time to explain all the options to me rrb and located in a funky renovated midcentury modern building lrb kudos to investing in phoenix heritage rrb i would definitely recommend this vet
i always get star service here i m most often there when i stop by and get a coffee on the way to the farmers market early saturday mornings and it s almost always busy luckly busy does nt seem to matter the employees always have a smile and are ready for a quick chat while you order or wait this location does seem to be a few cents more then others though even the one just down the street near target is almost a buck less with coffees
these folks are my heroes for over a year after first moving downtown i suffered by ordering pizza hut for delivery thinking it was my only option a neighbor enlightened me i called z pizza the first time they delivered something to me i almost wept with joy you have to understand how much pain and pizzatorture i went through before seeing the z light not only do they always deliver on time but their food is among the best i ve had anywhere in phoenix that delivers i select something different from the menu almost every time i order and i ve yet to be disappointed the delivery drivers also tend to be cool dudes
brisket and ribs brisket and ribs brisket and ribs did i say brisket and ribs  as a certified bbq judge i am very picky about my bbq that having been said i have traveled minutes each way many many times to eat here as you might guess my favorites here are the brisket and ribs both have a very nice texture with enough smoke flavor to make any bbq fan happy for the sides i will normally get the mac  cheese and the sweet potato fries both are real palate pleasers
 okay i love adore and care for target it s simply great so convenient and such great selection of products and prices my favorite one will always be the one adjacent to pv mall its close to home and the people working there are always wonderful rrb  everyone is oh so nice and welcoming
teds hot dogs are the best in town i ve never liked hot dogs until i ate at teds these are nt your regular hot dogs or sausages you find at your local chain grocery store they use quality meats and natural casing and cook them over a charcoal grill best hot dog i have ever had hands down
yes i do rock the hipster joints i dig this place a little bit of a scene but the food is solid and the service is great hard not like it all in all a great spot i tend to switch up my favorites but i typically hit this up for breakfast when in the
everytime my husband and i go here we always have a great experience the food is always good and fresh the service is excellent we hold a tradition every year to go here on our anniversary we go there even if its not our anniversary i recommend every single person to this restaurant i am looking f orward to going back there again in the future hopefully sooner rather than later
shuffleboard is gone lrb
we had heard about them through a friend and after diner out thursday night we drove by bl pool supplies and they were closed the gentleman i spoke to was walking around inside and waived pointed to his watch shrugged his shoulders and walked into the dark of the back of the store with that we called northwest pool supplies the next day and woman who answered the phone answered all my questions pleasantly and discovered that there prices were lower and bad a better selection with many choices very knowledgeable on all types of pools and pool needs puts the hillbillies at bl pools to shame we have seen the light and will drive miles when bl is less than yards across rd ave convert for life 
only stars  lrb a few notes the folks that rated this place low must have been isolated incidences and i feel weigh far to heavy on service rather than product dining at a restaurant rate the service a lil harder but a coffee shop hold your tongue rrb anyway this place rocks we are nt super close but we pass up several coffee shops en route to lola because the quality is top drawer the beans fair trade and the roast is perfect the price of a bag of beans is amazing doing right by the farmers and then respecting the product with such a solid roast this is what is all about i have yet to find a better americano a splash of cream and a splenda only augments the flavor of the espresso and the richness really shines i ve been to most of the independent coffee shops throughout the area and if i do find myself elsewhere i can only compare them to lola and lola wins out each time
i have to say i had probably one of the best dining experiences of my life the other day when we went for lunch at aiello s and for a reasonable price as well i was quite surprised to say the least the location would not lead you to think you d be in a setting surrounded by greenery but it is once you go inside to be greeted as nicely as we were is another thing the regular waitress had an emergency so we learned later that our server was the owners wife i do nt know when i ve be taken through a room set as nicely as there the white table clothes the colored napkins all gave a sense of being in harmony another thing that rarely happens in phoenix she placed our napkins for us this happens on the coast maybe san francisco or in dallas but in phoenix  my feeling of aiello s is of one of those restaurants that happens when culture has reached a point it is right for the moment our city has grown to the point that places like this should start happening they are long overdue we had two pasta dishesangel hair pasta with meatballs and i ca nt remember the type of pasta with wild mushrooms and shallots each was served uniquely not like what you expect and are served at one of the chain restaurants the sauces are delectablejust the right consistency and flavors to be savored the presentation is one that you expect from a chef when the dishes are served properly to my way of thinking they draw your eye to the of colors and textures what a delight for this to occur here with each course of our meals i am looking forward to going back to see what else he can do with other selections on the menu lrb i just really like to write a review like this let me continue rrb this is also a restaurant where you must plan on having desserts rrb i rarely do as am on a perpetual stay the weight i want to be diet here they are so good i helped to eat one and finished another at the time we were there they were photographing a table set with desserts imagine my surprise when we were asked if we d like to have the desserts that had just been photographed courtesy of aiello s they were wonderful i felt like the fatted calf when we left and it was worth every calorie to enjoy them if one is going to indulge you might as well do it at aiello s probably the greatest compliment this restaurant could receive was when my dining companion said let s sit for while when we were finished she has traveled the world over and has dined extensively i felt the same it was a great experience and while let it end i had this established recommended to me while having keys cut at the hardware store hardly the best place to get a recommendation also the same individual roared off on a motorcycle not another reason for me to think that much about said recommendation however this fellow seemed so truly taken with aiello s that we went there in spite of misgivings speaking of misgivings i did nt say when we got there we were the only people in the establishment for me this means the red flags go up immediately why is it empty  i knew two and maybe three places had failed in this location before another not good sign i truly had to resist the urge to suggest leaving i am so pleased that we did nt we d have missed this diamond hidden on central above camelback road one comment concerning casual dressing at aiello s i would be perfectly comfortable wearing slacks or a tuxedo dining here at lunch i might wear jeans i do nt see aiello s for being a cut offs and t shirt type of place there are enough places you can do that appreciate aiello s for what it is worth and dress the part is my suggestion
ca nt believe no one has reviewed this little gem of a shop or maybe i can since i am usually one of less than three customers in there at any given time despite the shop s location next to aj s in a pretty busy plaza urbayn has been my destination for fun cool unique gift items for the past two years or so it has so much stuff i think it s easier for me to just rattle off a list if you are looking for gifts go here they have for drinkers literally hundreds of handpainted wine glasses champagne flutes martini glasses pilsner glasses mugs flasks shaker sets bottle stoppers wine charms coasters quirky cocktail napkins shot glass sets books and games having to do with drinking if you need a wine glass painted with the image of a boozed up gal that says fag hag in cursive you will find it here for hostesses platters and other beautifully decorated serveware always the most interesting seasonal items napkin rings hors doeuvres picks and an amazing selection of cheese boards and other cheese enthusiast items lrb more than even sur la table rrb for babies adorable booties blankets bears and piggy banks for home candles and other decor items desk accessories and picture frames they have this cool potpourri bar where instead of your typical dried leaves and flowers you can select your own mix of colorful scented gravel and then accessorize it with all kinds of rocks shells etc plus buy a beautiful container to keep it all in for accessories enthusiasts a literal ton of fashion earrings priced approximately  per pair i can not imagine not finding a pair lrb or five rrb i like on any given day other jewelry too but the earrings by far are the best part assortments of clutches funky reading glasses scarves about the only thing i do nt like are the handbags they are borderline gaudy or in some cases really gaudy kinda like those kathy van zeeland monstrosities clogging up all of the ross and marshall s stores lately i guess i just prefer a more classic simple look for a bag that said my year old mom would probably like the bag she also likes to watch qvc and the rest cute stuff for your pets like food bowls leashes etc cheeky gifts for the bride and groom to be all kinds of personalized luggage tags some bath and body items and endless other tchotchkes like magnets notepads and key chains urbayn rocks rrb
the rose and crown is an unequivocally english pub some yards or so from pizzeria bianco i walked in here to chat with the management the day after it opened lrb which was on december rrb to try and get the scoop first impressions are everything and i liked the interior the moment i walked inside the pictures i snapped say it all hardwood floors thick wooden tables and a strong londoncentric theme to the decor lrb the lobby greets you with a modernday map of the tube for example rrb i find this to be the perfect complement to heritage square which has a victorian theme to it anyway pizzeria bianco notwithstanding as cool as bar bianco is to hang out while waiting for dinner at the pizzeria this is a great alternative the manager told me they were still working out its hours depending on how busy things would get i urged him to keep the hours as late as possible since downtown has a deficit of late night alternatives during the week if this bar turns out to meet its potential it could easily be as busy as the roosevelt tavern which is pretty busy on weeknights all the way through its closing at midnight and on weekends til am there apparently will be a limited kitchen on their opening night however their kitchen staff were completely overwhelmed and they had to shut down the food early because it was impossible to keep up so the folks here clearly have some kinks to work out but the space looks awesome and i love the english theme ca nt wait to try it out on a friday night update in just a few weeks i have basically adopted rose and crown as my new neighborhood bar you want a beer with me  i m dragging you here i ve also now sampled their fish and chips cottage pie and sheperd s pie and all of them are surprisingly lrb for bar food rrb really really good i especially dig the english theme including the sometimes cheesy british pop songs in the background i suggest not limiting yourself to just what s on tap because they have an extensive collection of beers from the british isles my choice every time is belhaven a scottish ale
always friendly clean and if there is something wrong they try to fix it each location that i have gone to has always great service
janice and her team created the most beautiful flowers sprays and arrangements for our brother s memorial with only days advanced notice the flowers were at the church on time beautiful and awe inspiring thank you for the comfort you gave us in our time of need mom loved the flowers
i m not normally one to jump at reviewing a chain restaurant especially when there are subways all within a couple blocks of each other i felt it was necessary in this case my husband and i came here over the weekend after a lovely trip to the dog park the two guys working here on the lonely afternoon were awesome they were really nice and friendly and quite chatty one of them started helping my husband and the other one was sweeping while i was deciding the sweeping boy apparently noticed i was ready and he quickly ran to the back washed his hands threw on gloves and asked me what i wanted wow this type of service has never happened at the other locations all of which i have been too he chatted with me as i told him what i wanted he also joked about my weird sandwich and made me laugh it s refreshing to see a couple guys working on a boring day and actually enjoying themselves they also have outdoor seating which are perfect to sit at and people watch on beautiful days we even met this incredible year old guy who is blind and deaf in both ears but somehow managed to communicate with us perfectly he was much more lively than most twentysomethings you meet amazing only in downtown do you meet people like that this is a great subway go here and skip the others
love love love awesome wine good service good gifts good buzz
when we arrived they got right to work we had a quarter size hole in the front windshield they were done in record time you were all a great bunch very attentive janie who we made the appointment with was very nice the price was better than we expected thanks for all your help if it happens again we will be back
the customer service at this place is great when i went the shop was pretty busy but the guys working were on top of it they knew everything about anything that had to do with riding a bike i explained that i could nt spend a whole lot of money on replacements for mine so they figured out how to oil a few things up and replace a couple small things and i was good to go walmart bikes are history for me now that i know about real bikes yeah they are a lot more expensive but they are a lot cheaper when you figure in how many times you will have to get it fixed the shop dog is adorable the guys are super nice and the selection is small but it s just right who needs a huge selection when you can have a small selection of just the right items  the helmets are the coolest on the block and the accessories i did nt even know i needed so many cool additions on my bike
i love this store i wish they had in california this is the closest one to me so i only come out here once a year when we go to az for spring training this place has the cutest stuff and a great selection on old school candy i did nt go to the restaurant this time but i have been before they had good food as well such as chicken and dumplings which i consider cozy and a great home cookin meal i ll be back next year
all i can say is yummm they make the best old fashioned donuts i am a sucker for a good donut and would nt bother with the corporate chains if you re going to eat a donut eat your donut here lrb or at rainbow donuts if you re up north rrb the only thing that would make this place and rainbow better is if they had an espresso machine do yourself a favor and go get yourself a donut now
i have a special place in my heart for this restaurant as it was the site of my boyfriend and mine s nd date rrb however their food is sooooo good and i do nt think its because i m biased i always end up getting their gnocchi with vodka sauce because it is just that good
let s see what is there not to like about surprise stadium  well tall cans of pbr is about all i could come up with and that s not a surprise lrb pun intended rrb considering you re attending a sporting event even spring training but as someone who does not living in arizona and as someone who does nt go to mlb baseball games in southern california due to the fact it costs so damn much people bitching about the slow service or any other little inconvenience when it comes to seeing a game here look you re lucky enough to have almost an entire month of low cost mlb baseball right in your back yard if i could i d live down here during march just to take in the awesome baseball action that crisscrosses the phoenix metro area each year i attended my first spring training game on march th at surprise stadium as the royals took on the san francisco giants lrb my favorite team rrb our seats lrb sec row j seats  rrb were bucks each lrb around bucks including service fees rrb i mean we were maybe or rows back from the giants dugout lrb check out some of my pictures rrb the stadium lrb funny calling it that since it only holds just over people rrb is big enough so you feel you re at an mlb game but small enough to feel pretty close and intimate with the players the stadium is well maintained and kept super clean arriving to the park i was surprised lrb pun unintended rrb to see that parking was free an oddity when going to an event like this the stadium staff as mentioned by other reviews are mainly made up of senior citizens who were super friendly and helpful i did nt have to wait long at the concession stands even if lines were a bit long the outfield is lined with a lawn area perfect for people to sit back and have a picnic while taking in a game lrb tickets are around bucks each after service fees rrb i love this place and hope to return next year when visiting family oh giants won  go giants
this is our kind a real winnerthe most godly breakfast burrito i ve ever had and fressssshhhhh made with their own special salsa love the urban decor indoor and you see a mexican grandma cookin it up in the kitchenyou know you re in good hands we had to wait for a while for our food but that was good news to us  ignore the whiners who demand the food fast it meant that they were cooking everything from scratch it s important that chefs invest their time and love in their food and it reflected through my first ahh this is heavenly bite of the burrito i m so happy i found this place i plan on buying their el sol salsa always follow the traditional mexican bakeryguaranteed you will get authentic mexican dish not only el sol was an exciting discovery but downtown chandler is a very cute n historic area to scope out it s filled with many other mexican joints which i m sure are delicious i look forward to going back to that area this beats los favoritos period
i never go here alone because i like introducing friends to joe s farm grill for the first time this is for several reasons rrb it s a beautiful farm atmosphere in what some consider the middle of the desert rrb it was featured on diners driveins and dives and i m a sucker for tripled rrb a fresh and tasty take on fast food rrb unique wacky bathrooms rrb mustsee pneumatic condiment fountain in fact one of the times i visited it was tripled month which meant they had a lot of promotions relating to their appearance on the muchheralded food network show you could even score a gift card if you showed up dressed like guy fieri i might ve been able to grow out and twotone the goatee but since i m bald i d never be able to pull off the spikyhaired thing i will admit i was tempted to borrow my neighbor s blonde kid and costume him up just to save a couple of bucks on the fine burgers here all the item menus in red type are the meals featured during the blingy one s visit so i ve been working through them one at a time i give a thumbs up to the fontina burger and the ahi tuna sandwich but i m not terribly crazy about the sweet potato fries with the pineappleserrano dipping sauce i did fall in love with their garlic fries however and have to recommend them dipped in the joe s bbq sauce lrb available at the funtouse pneumatic condiment fountain rrb you ca nt go wrong with a visit to joe s farm grill even if you re not pulling up in a bitchin camaro
the peppered steak pasty is amazing and the peppercorn brandy sauce is so addictive also the carne adovada pasty is great they have too many pasties to choose from which is just another reason to keep coming back for dessert get the banoffee pie but save room because it is huge lrb big enough for two people or more rrb also if you like beer they have a lot of it and you can get steins if quantity is your thing
bicyclefriendly and vegan green is one of my favorite places i ordered a mickey sandwich with a side of faux buffalo wings while that was being prepped i ducked out to nami next door and got a peanut butter and chocolate blizzard nondiary treat it was obvious that i should eat the nami first because its the best that nami was so delicious it made the whole meal a real treat thanks to the cooks at green and the folks at nami i had a vegan feast fit for a peasant cole slaw french fries and tasty vegan meats layered between toasted bread of the mickey sandwich it was simply good
thanks kale for checking out my bike and fixing some minor things that could have turned into a disaster
well i was told to go to this place by none other than gabi m because i am a philistine and i had no idea it existed but i did nt go right away which was my loss because this place is phenomenal i finally ended up here somewhat fortuitously because a student of mine suggested it anyway i ve been doing this phoenix biggest loser thing because my wife says i m the biggest loser in phoenix so when amber w started up a competition with the same name i figured hell i can win that turns out it s about weight loss and so that pretty much means i m screwed on the entry fee well i was nt until i went here my diet was doing very well thank you  until  i went to lgo as soon as i walked in i was met with a tsunami of poor health choices and did nt know just how to hold it together pumpkinchocolate chunk muffin  blackberry bran muffin  lrb which i ordered because bran  fiber  healthy der rrb strawberry muffin  cream cheese coffee cake  and a million more delightful delicacies which tempted me for forty seconds before i gave in well not really here s how it went down i held firm and got oatmeal with bananas strawberries and raisins spare me the nutritionist s take i m confident that was the best i could do so i was pretty proud of myself but i  did  have to bring home a muffin to my wife because that story about her saying i was a big loser was a lie and she s actually pretty great so i paid for the strawberry muffin but at the last minute changed to blackberry bran at an employee s recommendation and god damn i am glad i did because that is probably the best muffin i ever had note since the charming gabi m decided to laugh at me for my food choices  all night  at the oye i will point out that i ate only  of the muffin that s it that s like um a  healthy choice based on my math anyway my student had an english muffin with avocado and smoked salmon that i was looking lustily at so she told me that i  must  have an english muffin she bought a pack and gave me two lrb i m a good tutor evidently rrb and so of course i had to eat one i say that defensively because gabi laughed at me for the english muffin too i m scarred anyway i know this review is dragging because my wife is now watching lifetime which means that her head is being filled with all sort of antiman propaganda as i type so i ll wrap it up today we went there and i had a croque madame which is a whole grain open face deal with ham and tomato and mustard and a sunny side up egg pretty damn good but we also had the strawberry muffin which was a little disappointing not moist enough and not strawberryy enough so i give this place five stars anyway because it is super cute and i do nt think i could eat everything i wanted to eat there if i went in for days straight i loved it and for the acting on lifetime one star and the writing i love billy but i love you more really  really pulitzer prize stuff that
i ve been here dozens and dozens of times over the last years stars without a doubt standouts are the italian beef with lots o hot their cheese fries are absolute perfection here s why put fries in a basket smother them with cheese sauce put another hand full of fries in basket smother again with cheese sauce when you are done with these cheese fries you are looking for more fries for the cheese not more cheese for the fries then when you walk out school girls and boys break into song and birds start chirping oh i have to mention the cheese steak i do nt like the standard way they do it lrb beef onions cheese rrb but if you ask for it philly style they do it with their cheese sauce that they add extra cheddar cheese to yum yum yum
yay soda for everyone from the common pepsi with real sugar to the more exotic japanese drinks and rare finds this place rocks i saw an ad in a local rag and remembered it was featured on some travel program years ago and we know had to stop in ahhh a huge selection of creme sodas
the whole feel of the place is one of knowledge and empowerment while healing every one is helpful and really good at their job i have been going there for months to work on my achilles tendon i have also transitioned to their personal trainer rich who has been able to help me get my strength back while understanding and working within my limitations i highly recommend this facility to any one who needs either physical therapy or a personal trainer
this place is too cool for school nobuo is a nice guy and an absolute master of his trade nobuo comes from sea saw in old town scottdale which was part of peter kasperski s empire that seems to be falling apart more and more when sea saw unfortunately closed we all knew that nobuo would either run off to california and open up there or come downtown glad he came back to the city and turned an awfully ran old tea house into a fantastic spotless neighborhood hang out the building built in the early s is a beautiful japanese tavern style from the furniture to the art and onto the gorgeous solid one piece bar top he hangs out behind this bar and creates his culinary masterpieces here right in plain view the waiters and waitresses meanwhile create your unique cocktails made with fresh fruits and veggies as well as fresh garnishes i tried the cucumber martini which was fantastic look for the specials each night and try whatever they are nobuo also does omakase lrb chef s choice rrb where you and three of your closest friends sit at the aforementioned wood counter and try whatever he puts in front of you at some point in the night you ll wonder how much you re spending nobuo at teeter house is not cheap but good things are nt cheap when you purchase fresh produce from mcclendon fish from japan and rent in heratige square you have to charge a premium for your product if you do nt understand this then you should nt shy away from taco bell anymore they do offer a great happy hour mf if you want to save money but i recommend nobuo for a night when you do nt have to worry about how much your spending it s a very special restaurant and deserves to be enjoyed in a very special way
this restaurant is a perfect example of why i give my money to local business owners this is a sparsely decorated gem in midtown phoenix in an area full of lunch only counter order spaces one would think this would nt be welcome i love a rice bowl every now and then and this one is extremely high quality and stocks every type of rice bowl imaginable i ve had the oyako and teriyaki both multiple times and they are delcious you definitely wait a few minutes for your food and that is a good thing because it means they are not mass producing food and waiting for people to order it like tokyo express does good food alone though wo nt garner a fivestar review for a rice bowl what pushes blue fin over the top is the ownership the little old japanese lady who owns and runs the restaurant during lunch time is one of the absolute nicest people i ve ever encountered she welcomes every customer and speaks to you in a genuine family like manner she does not come across as fake or asskissish i just get a calm warm and welcome feeling from this woman when i come in here it s not even just her either her staff always looks happy and has run of the soda fountain water lemonade etc everyone just seems to be happy it s true that if you take care of your staff they make your customers happy as well many other places make me feel so unwelcome around here at lunch time but i can always count on blue fin to treat me like family and give me a solid rice bowl
the iced toddy has helped me through many a night and is delicious rrb love cartel
great food great service you have to try cevapis
liz is by far the best cpa that i have ever found she truly cares about every single one of her clients and treats them on a more personal level she really takes the time to explain things i feel very secure having her as my cpa and i know i am getting a huge savings through liz i would recommend this to everyone and anyone
definitely amongst the best sushi i ever ate everything was awesome and portions were decent too we went in a group of and tried almost everything on the menu i had some sort of salad there cant remember what it was exactly but it was the best dish
the atmosphere  food are amazing we tried the beef stroganoff and the chicken the first was preferred the pretzel fondue is unreal good and the cheap salad was very tasty the bartender even created a special drink for one who had a taste for something not on the menu be sure to try this place
 locations all star average i think arizona really has some fantastic pizza options and spinatos is at the top of my pizza fix list the semi sweet sauce is addictive great service fresh ingredients the spicy italian is my favorite the chocolate chips cookies are laced with mind altering drugs that make your body parts romantic when you think of their cookies btw pm on a tuesday when we left a minute wait its on the list
ikea is so much fun it s a little bit of a walk up and down the store but with all the different items on display there is time to sit and relax on the chairs couches beds i love walking around the store looking a new ideas for my own home they have very good prices on all household items when shopping for accessories for the house i highly recommend going to ikea because you are bound to find something simple things such as tupperware trash cans bathroom accessories can all be found at a really good price
after the padres spring training game we had reservations at don  charlie s in scottsdale none of us had been here before and it came highly recommended by my dad as soon as you walk into don and charlie s your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts i especially like the cactus league beer list which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the cactus league colorado  coors light texas  shiner bock chicago  old style and san diego  stone ipa etc also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated i had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great i was nt thrilled with the side dish potato s au gratin which is a upcharge they also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entre or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw we were too full for dessert and as we walked out this place was packed i found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat willie mays himself he was signing his book lrb or a baseball rrb for a charitable donation to his foundation needless to say i m not bringing home any memorabilia myself
nobuo shows his unique talents with everything on the menu carefully crafted features with much to drink start with the pork belly buns and a stout then go on until you can no longer
